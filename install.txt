This Project uses two fairly large datasets.
How to get the full datasets are described in section 2.2.1 and 3.1 in the jupyter notebook.

However, the full datasets are huge, and we are only using a small subset, which we've made available on https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Odg_vpAXTmonnaHMgYFe66orW_UqB_XZ/view?usp=sharing

After downloading, the folders `decades` and `processedData` and `CC_BY` are all to extracted into the `data` folder of the solution.
