# Installation:
This Project uses two fairly large datasets.
How to get the full datasets are described in section 2.2.1 and 3.1 in the jupyter notebook.

However, the full datasets are huge, and we are only using a small subset, which we've made available on https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Odg_vpAXTmonnaHMgYFe66orW_UqB_XZ/view?usp=sharing

After downloading, the folders `decades` and `processedData` which are under the folder `BookSolution` are to be extracted into the same folder as the jupyter notebook.
The folder named `CC_BY` is to be extracted into the parent directory of the notebook.
