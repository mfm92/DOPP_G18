    "This is a very rough first draft at importing and cleansing the data. Solution if heavily inspired by (okay... Completely ripped off) from https://gist.github.com/mbforbes/cee3fd5bb3a797b059524fe8c8ccdc2b\n",

    "## Getting the content\n",
    "Start by downloading the repository of (english) books. This is done in bash. Only tested on Ubuntu, but mac should work the same\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "wget -m -H -nd \"http://www.gutenberg.org/robot/harvest?filetypes[]=txt&langs[]=en\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Takes a few hours to run, and is stored in a folder called rawContent. \n",
    "This is then copied to another folder, and we can start to clean up the mess\n",
    "\n",
    "First we delete some dublications of the same books:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ls | grep \"\\-8.zip\" | xargs rm\n",
    "ls | grep \"\\-0.zip\" | xargs rm\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can then unzip the files, and remove the zip files\n",
    "```\n",
    "unzip \"*zip\"\n",
    "rm *.zip\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we take care of some nested foldering\n",
    "```\n",
    "mv */*.txt ./\n",
    "```\n",
    "And finally, we remove all rubbish that isn't a real book:\n",

      "A tall, slim girl, \"half-past sixteen,\" with serious gray eyes and hair\n",
      "which her friends called auburn, had sat down on the broad red sandstone\n",
      "doorstep of a Prince Edward Island farmhouse one ripe afternoon in\n",
      "August, firmly resolved to construe so many lines of Virgil.\n",
      "\n",
      "But an August afternoon, with blue hazes scarfing the harvest slopes,\n",
      "little winds whispering elfishly in the poplars, and a dancing slendor\n",
      "of red poppies outflaming against the dark coppice of young firs in a\n",
      "corner of the cherry orchard, was fitter for dreams than dead languages.\n",
      "The Virgil soon slipped unheeded to the ground, and Anne, her chin\n",
      "propped on her clasped hands, and her eyes on the splendid mass of\n",
      "fluffy clouds that were heaping up just over Mr. J. A. Harrison's house\n",
      "like a great white mountain, was far away in a delicious world where a\n",
      "certain schoolteacher was doing a wonderful work, shaping the destinies\n",
      "of future statesmen, and inspiring youthful minds and hearts with high\n",
      "and lofty ambitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure, if you came down to harsh facts . . . which, it must be\n",
      "confessed, Anne seldom did until she had to . . . it did not seem likely\n",
      "that there was much promising material for celebrities in Avonlea\n",
      "school; but you could never tell what might happen if a teacher used\n",
      "her influence for good. Anne had certain rose-tinted ideals of what a\n",
      "teacher might accomplish if she only went the right way about it; and\n",
      "she was in the midst of a delightful scene, forty years hence, with a\n",
      "famous personage . . . just exactly what he was to be famous for was left\n",
      "in convenient haziness, but Anne thought it would be rather nice to have\n",
      "him a college president or a Canadian premier . . . bowing low over her\n",
      "wrinkled hand and assuring her that it was she who had first kindled his\n",
      "ambition, and that all his success in life was due to the lessons she\n",
      "had instilled so long ago in Avonlea school. This pleasant vision was\n",
      "shattered by a most unpleasant interruption.\n",
      "\n",
      "A demure little Jersey cow came scuttling down the lane and five seconds\n",
      "later Mr. Harrison arrived . . . if \"arrived\" be not too mild a term to\n",
      "describe the manner of his irruption into the yard.\n",
      "\n",
      "He bounced over the fence without waiting to open the gate, and angrily\n",
      "confronted astonished Anne, who had risen to her feet and stood looking\n",
      "at him in some bewilderment. Mr. Harrison was their new righthand\n",
      "neighbor and she had never met him before, although she had seen him\n",
      "once or twice.\n",
      "\n",
      "In early April, before Anne had come home from Queen's, Mr. Robert Bell,\n",
      "whose farm adjoined the Cuthbert place on the west, had sold out and\n",
      "moved to Charlottetown. His farm had been bought by a certain Mr. J. A.\n",
      "Harrison, whose name, and the fact that he was a New Brunswick man, were\n",
      "all that was known about him. But before he had been a month in Avonlea\n",
      "he had won the reputation of being an odd person . . . \"a crank,\" Mrs.\n",
      "Rachel Lynde said. Mrs. Rachel was an outspoken lady, as those of you\n",
      "who may have already made her acquaintance will remember. Mr. Harrison\n",
      "was certainly different from other people . . . and that is the essential\n",
      "characteristic of a crank, as everybody knows.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first place he kept house for himself and had publicly stated\n",
      "that he wanted no fools of women around his diggings. Feminine\n",
      "Avonlea took its revenge by the gruesome tales it related about his\n",
      "house-keeping and cooking. He had hired little John Henry Carter of\n",
      "White Sands and John Henry started the stories. For one thing, there\n",
      "was never any stated time for meals in the Harrison establishment. Mr.\n",
      "Harrison \"got a bite\" when he felt hungry, and if John Henry were around\n",
      "at the time, he came in for a share, but if he were not, he had to wait\n",
      "until Mr. Harrison's next hungry spell. John Henry mournfully averred\n",
      "that he would have starved to death if it wasn't that he got home on\n",
      "Sundays and got a good filling up, and that his mother always gave him a\n",
      "basket of \"grub\" to take back with him on Monday mornings.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for washing dishes, Mr. Harrison never made any pretence of doing it\n",
      "unless a rainy Sunday came. Then he went to work and washed them all at\n",
      "once in the rainwater hogshead, and left them to drain dry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, Mr. Harrison was \"close.\" When he was asked to subscribe to the\n",
      "Rev. Mr. Allan's salary he said he'd wait and see how many dollars'\n",
      "worth of good he got out of his preaching first . . . he didn't believe\n",
      "in buying a pig in a poke. And when Mrs. Lynde went to ask for a\n",
      "contribution to missions . . . and incidentally to see the inside of\n",
      "the house . . . he told her there were more heathens among the old woman\n",
      "gossips in Avonlea than anywhere else he knew of, and he'd cheerfully\n",
      "contribute to a mission for Christianizing them if she'd undertake it.\n",
      "Mrs. Rachel got herself away and said it was a mercy poor Mrs. Robert\n",
      "Bell was safe in her grave, for it would have broken her heart to see\n",
      "the state of her house in which she used to take so much pride.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, she scrubbed the kitchen floor every second day,\" Mrs. Lynde told\n",
      "Marilla Cuthbert indignantly, \"and if you could see it now! I had to\n",
      "hold up my skirts as I walked across it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, Mr. Harrison kept a parrot called Ginger. Nobody in Avonlea had\n",
      "ever kept a parrot before; consequently that proceeding was considered\n",
      "barely respectable. And such a parrot! If you took John Henry Carter's\n",
      "word for it, never was such an unholy bird. It swore terribly. Mrs.\n",
      "Carter would have taken John Henry away at once if she had been sure\n",
      "she could get another place for him. Besides, Ginger had bitten a piece\n",
      "right out of the back of John Henry's neck one day when he had stooped\n",
      "down too near the cage. Mrs. Carter showed everybody the mark when the\n",
      "luckless John Henry went home on Sundays.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these things flashed through Anne's mind as Mr. Harrison stood,\n",
      "quite speechless with wrath apparently, before her. In his most amiable\n",
      "mood Mr. Harrison could not have been considered a handsome man; he was\n",
      "short and fat and bald; and now, with his round face purple with rage\n",
      "and his prominent blue eyes almost sticking out of his head, Anne\n",
      "thought he was really the ugliest person she had ever seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "All at once Mr. Harrison found his voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not going to put up with this,\" he spluttered, \"not a day longer,\n",
      "do you hear, miss. Bless my soul, this is the third time, miss . . .  the\n",
      "third time! Patience has ceased to be a virtue, miss. I warned your aunt\n",
      "the last time not to let it occur again . . .  and she's let it . . . she's\n",
      "done it . . . what does she mean by it, that is what I want to know. That\n",
      "is what I'm here about, miss.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will you explain what the trouble is?\" asked Anne, in her most\n",
      "dignified manner. She had been practicing it considerably of late to\n",
      "have it in good working order when school began; but it had no apparent\n",
      "effect on the irate J. A. Harrison.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Trouble, is it? Bless my soul, trouble enough, I should think. The\n",
      "trouble is, miss, that I found that Jersey cow of your aunt's in my oats\n",
      "again, not half an hour ago. The third time, mark you. I found her in\n",
      "last Tuesday and I found her in yesterday. I came here and told your\n",
      "aunt not to let it occur again. She has let it occur again. Where's your\n",
      "aunt, miss? I just want to see her for a minute and give her a piece of\n",
      "my mind . . . a piece of J. A. Harrison's mind, miss.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you mean Miss Marilla Cuthbert, she is not my aunt, and she has gone\n",
      "down to East Grafton to see a distant relative of hers who is very ill,\"\n",
      "said Anne, with due increase of dignity at every word. \"I am very sorry\n",
      "that my cow should have broken into your oats . . .  she is my cow and not\n",
      "Miss Cuthbert's . . . Matthew gave her to me three years ago when she was\n",
      "a little calf and he bought her from Mr. Bell.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sorry, miss! Sorry isn't going to help matters any. You'd better go and\n",
      "look at the havoc that animal has made in my oats . . . trampled them from\n",
      "center to circumference, miss.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am very sorry,\" repeated Anne firmly, \"but perhaps if you kept your\n",
      "fences in better repair Dolly might not have broken in. It is your part\n",
      "of the line fence that separates your oatfield from our pasture and I\n",
      "noticed the other day that it was not in very good condition.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My fence is all right,\" snapped Mr. Harrison, angrier than ever at this\n",
      "carrying of the war into the enemy's country. \"The jail fence couldn't\n",
      "keep a demon of a cow like that out. And I can tell you, you redheaded\n",
      "snippet, that if the cow is yours, as you say, you'd be better employed\n",
      "in watching her out of other people's grain than in sitting round\n",
      "reading yellow-covered novels,\" . . . with a scathing glance at the\n",
      "innocent tan-colored Virgil by Anne's feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Something at that moment was red besides Anne's hair . . . which had\n",
      "always been a tender point with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'd rather have red hair than none at all, except a little fringe round\n",
      "my ears,\" she flashed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shot told, for Mr. Harrison was really very sensitive about his bald\n",
      "head. His anger choked him up again and he could only glare speechlessly\n",
      "at Anne, who recovered her temper and followed up her advantage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can make allowance for you, Mr. Harrison, because I have an\n",
      "imagination. I can easily imagine how very trying it must be to find a\n",
      "cow in your oats and I shall not cherish any hard feelings against you\n",
      "for the things you've said. I promise you that Dolly shall never break\n",
      "into your oats again. I give you my word of honor on THAT point.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, mind you she doesn't,\" muttered Mr. Harrison in a somewhat\n",
      "subdued tone; but he stamped off angrily enough and Anne heard him\n",
      "growling to himself until he was out of earshot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grievously disturbed in mind, Anne marched across the yard and shut the\n",
      "naughty Jersey up in the milking pen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She can't possibly get out of that unless she tears the fence down,\"\n",
      "she reflected. \"She looks pretty quiet now. I daresay she has sickened\n",
      "herself on those oats. I wish I'd sold her to Mr. Shearer when he wanted\n",
      "her last week, but I thought it was just as well to wait until we had\n",
      "the auction of the stock and let them all go together. I believe it is\n",
      "true about Mr. Harrison being a crank. Certainly there's nothing of the\n",
      "kindred spirit about HIM.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne had always a weather eye open for kindred spirits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marilla Cuthbert was driving into the yard as Anne returned from the\n",
      "house, and the latter flew to get tea ready. They discussed the matter\n",
      "at the tea table.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll be glad when the auction is over,\" said Marilla. \"It is too much\n",
      "responsibility having so much stock about the place and nobody but that\n",
      "unreliable Martin to look after them. He has never come back yet and he\n",
      "promised that he would certainly be back last night if I'd give him the\n",
      "day off to go to his aunt's funeral. I don't know how many aunts he has\n",
      "got, I am sure. That's the fourth that's died since he hired here a year\n",
      "ago. I'll be more than thankful when the crop is in and Mr. Barry takes\n",
      "over the farm. We'll have to keep Dolly shut up in the pen till Martin\n",
      "comes, for she must be put in the back pasture and the fences there have\n",
      "to be fixed. I declare, it is a world of trouble, as Rachel says. Here's\n",
      "poor Mary Keith dying and what is to become of those two children of\n",
      "hers is more than I know. She has a brother in British Columbia and she\n",
      "has written to him about them, but she hasn't heard from him yet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are the children like? How old are they?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Six past . . . they're twins.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I've always been especially interested in twins ever since Mrs.\n",
      "Hammond had so many,\" said Anne eagerly. \"Are they pretty?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Goodness, you couldn't tell . . . they were too dirty. Davy had been\n",
      "out making mud pies and Dora went out to call him in. Davy pushed her\n",
      "headfirst into the biggest pie and then, because she cried, he got into\n",
      "it himself and wallowed in it to show her it was nothing to cry about.\n",
      "Mary said Dora was really a very good child but that Davy was full of\n",
      "mischief. He has never had any bringing up you might say. His father\n",
      "died when he was a baby and Mary has been sick almost ever since.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm always sorry for children that have no bringing up,\" said Anne\n",
      "soberly. \"You know _I_ hadn't any till you took me in hand. I hope their\n",
      "uncle will look after them. Just what relation is Mrs. Keith to you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mary? None in the world. It was her husband . . . he was our third\n",
      "cousin. There's Mrs. Lynde coming through the yard. I thought she'd be\n",
      "up to hear about Mary.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't tell her about Mr. Harrison and the cow,\" implored Anne.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marilla promised; but the promise was quite unnecessary, for Mrs. Lynde\n",
      "was no sooner fairly seated than she said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I saw Mr. Harrison chasing your Jersey out of his oats today when I was\n",
      "coming home from Carmody. I thought he looked pretty mad. Did he make\n",
      "much of a rumpus?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne and Marilla furtively exchanged amused smiles. Few things in\n",
      "Avonlea ever escaped Mrs. Lynde. It was only that morning Anne had said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you went to your own room at midnight, locked the door, pulled down\n",
      "the blind, and SNEEZED, Mrs. Lynde would ask you the next day how your\n",
      "cold was!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I believe he did,\" admitted Marilla. \"I was away. He gave Anne a piece\n",
      "of his mind.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think he is a very disagreeable man,\" said Anne, with a resentful\n",
      "toss of her ruddy head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You never said a truer word,\" said Mrs. Rachel solemnly. \"I knew\n",
      "there'd be trouble when Robert Bell sold his place to a New Brunswick\n",
      "man, that's what. I don't know what Avonlea is coming to, with so many\n",
      "strange people rushing into it. It'll soon not be safe to go to sleep in\n",
      "our beds.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, what other strangers are coming in?\" asked Marilla.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Haven't you heard? Well, there's a family of Donnells, for one thing.\n",
      "They've rented Peter Sloane's old house. Peter has hired the man to run\n",
      "his mill. They belong down east and nobody knows anything about them.\n",
      "Then that shiftless Timothy Cotton family are going to move up from\n",
      "White Sands and they'll simply be a burden on the public. He is\n",
      "in consumption . . . when he isn't stealing . . .  and his wife is a\n",
      "slack-twisted creature that can't turn her hand to a thing. She washes\n",
      "her dishes SITTING DOWN. Mrs. George Pye has taken her husband's orphan\n",
      "nephew, Anthony Pye. He'll be going to school to you, Anne, so you may\n",
      "expect trouble, that's what. And you'll have another strange pupil, too.\n",
      "Paul Irving is coming from the States to live with his grandmother.\n",
      "You remember his father, Marilla . . . Stephen Irving, him that jilted\n",
      "Lavendar Lewis over at Grafton?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think he jilted her. There was a quarrel . . . I suppose there\n",
      "was blame on both sides.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, anyway, he didn't marry her, and she's been as queer as possible\n",
      "ever since, they say . . . living all by herself in that little stone\n",
      "house she calls Echo Lodge. Stephen went off to the States and went\n",
      "into business with his uncle and married a Yankee. He's never been home\n",
      "since, though his mother has been up to see him once or twice. His wife\n",
      "died two years ago and he's sending the boy home to his mother for a\n",
      "spell. He's ten years old and I don't know if he'll be a very desirable\n",
      "pupil. You can never tell about those Yankees.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs Lynde looked upon all people who had the misfortune to be born\n",
      "or brought up elsewhere than in Prince Edward Island with a decided\n",
      "can-any-good-thing-come-out-of-Nazareth air. They MIGHT be good people,\n",
      "of course; but you were on the safe side in doubting it. She had a\n",
      "special prejudice against \"Yankees.\" Her husband had been cheated out\n",
      "of ten dollars by an employer for whom he had once worked in Boston and\n",
      "neither angels nor principalities nor powers could have convinced Mrs.\n",
      "Rachel that the whole United States was not responsible for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Avonlea school won't be the worse for a little new blood,\" said Marilla\n",
      "drily, \"and if this boy is anything like his father he'll be all right.\n",
      "Steve Irving was the nicest boy that was ever raised in these parts,\n",
      "though some people did call him proud. I should think Mrs. Irving would\n",
      "be very glad to have the child. She has been very lonesome since her\n",
      "husband died.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, the boy may be well enough, but he'll be different from Avonlea\n",
      "children,\" said Mrs. Rachel, as if that clinched the matter. Mrs.\n",
      "Rachel's opinions concerning any person, place, or thing, were always\n",
      "warranted to wear. \"What's this I hear about your going to start up a\n",
      "Village Improvement Society, Anne?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was just talking it over with some of the girls and boys at the last\n",
      "Debating Club,\" said Anne, flushing. \"They thought it would be rather\n",
      "nice . . . and so do Mr. and Mrs. Allan. Lots of villages have them now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, you'll get into no end of hot water if you do. Better leave it\n",
      "alone, Anne, that's what. People don't like being improved.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, we are not going to try to improve the PEOPLE. It is Avonlea\n",
      "itself. There are lots of things which might be done to make it\n",
      "prettier. For instance, if we could coax Mr. Levi Boulter to pull\n",
      "down that dreadful old house on his upper farm wouldn't that be an\n",
      "improvement?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It certainly would,\" admitted Mrs. Rachel. \"That old ruin has been an\n",
      "eyesore to the settlement for years. But if you Improvers can coax\n",
      "Levi Boulter to do anything for the public that he isn't to be paid for\n",
      "doing, may I be there to see and hear the process, that's what. I don't\n",
      "want to discourage you, Anne, for there may be something in your idea,\n",
      "though I suppose you did get it out of some rubbishy Yankee magazine;\n",
      "but you'll have your hands full with your school and I advise you as a\n",
      "friend not to bother with your improvements, that's what. But there,\n",
      "I know you'll go ahead with it if you've set your mind on it. You were\n",
      "always one to carry a thing through somehow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Something about the firm outlines of Anne's lips told that Mrs. Rachel\n",
      "was not far astray in this estimate. Anne's heart was bent on forming\n",
      "the Improvement Society. Gilbert Blythe, who was to teach in White\n",
      "Sands but would always be home from Friday night to Monday morning, was\n",
      "enthusiastic about it; and most of the other folks were willing to go in\n",
      "for anything that meant occasional meetings and consequently some \"fun.\"\n",
      "As for what the \"improvements\" were to be, nobody had any very clear\n",
      "idea except Anne and Gilbert. They had talked them over and planned them\n",
      "out until an ideal Avonlea existed in their minds, if nowhere else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Rachel had still another item of news.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They've given the Carmody school to a Priscilla Grant. Didn't you go to\n",
      "Queen's with a girl of that name, Anne?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, indeed. Priscilla to teach at Carmody! How perfectly lovely!\"\n",
      "exclaimed Anne, her gray eyes lighting up until they looked like evening\n",
      "stars, causing Mrs. Lynde to wonder anew if she would ever get it\n",
      "settled to her satisfaction whether Anne Shirley were really a pretty\n",
      "girl or not.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne drove over to Carmody on a shopping expedition the next afternoon\n",
      "and took Diana Barry with her. Diana was, of course, a pledged member of\n",
      "the Improvement Society, and the two girls talked about little else all\n",
      "the way to Carmody and back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The very first thing we ought to do when we get started is to have that\n",
      "hall painted,\" said Diana, as they drove past the Avonlea hall, a rather\n",
      "shabby building set down in a wooded hollow, with spruce trees hooding\n",
      "it about on all sides. \"It's a disgraceful looking place and we must\n",
      "attend to it even before we try to get Mr. Levi Boulder to pull his\n",
      "house down. Father says we'll never succeed in DOING that. Levi Boulter\n",
      "is too mean to spend the time it would take.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps he'll let the boys take it down if they promise to haul\n",
      "the boards and split them up for him for kindling wood,\" said Anne\n",
      "hopefully. \"We must do our best and be content to go slowly at first.\n",
      "We can't expect to improve everything all at once. We'll have to educate\n",
      "public sentiment first, of course.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Diana wasn't exactly sure what educating public sentiment meant; but it\n",
      "sounded fine and she felt rather proud that she was going to belong to a\n",
      "society with such an aim in view.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought of something last night that we could do, Anne. You know\n",
      "that three-cornered piece of ground where the roads from Carmody and\n",
      "Newbridge and White Sands meet? It's all grown over with young spruce;\n",
      "but wouldn't it be nice to have them all cleared out, and just leave the\n",
      "two or three birch trees that are on it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Splendid,\" agreed Anne gaily. \"And have a rustic seat put under the\n",
      "birches. And when spring comes we'll have a flower-bed made in the\n",
      "middle of it and plant geraniums.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; only we'll have to devise some way of getting old Mrs. Hiram\n",
      "Sloane to keep her cow off the road, or she'll eat our geraniums\n",
      "up,\" laughed Diana. \"I begin to see what you mean by educating public\n",
      "sentiment, Anne. There's the old Boulter house now. Did you ever see\n",
      "such a rookery? And perched right close to the road too. An old house\n",
      "with its windows gone always makes me think of something dead with its\n",
      "eyes picked out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think an old, deserted house is such a sad sight,\" said Anne\n",
      "dreamily. \"It always seems to me to be thinking about its past and\n",
      "mourning for its old-time joys. Marilla says that a large family was\n",
      "raised in that old house long ago, and that it was a real pretty place,\n",
      "with a lovely garden and roses climbing all over it. It was full of\n",
      "little children and laughter and songs; and now it is empty, and nothing\n",
      "ever wanders through it but the wind. How lonely and sorrowful it must\n",
      "feel! Perhaps they all come back on moonlit nights . . . the ghosts of the\n",
      "little children of long ago and the roses and the songs . . . and for a\n",
      "little while the old house can dream it is young and joyous again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Diana shook her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never imagine things like that about places now, Anne. Don't you\n",
      "remember how cross mother and Marilla were when we imagined ghosts into\n",
      "the Haunted Wood? To this day I can't go through that bush comfortably\n",
      "after dark; and if I began imagining such things about the old Boulter\n",
      "house I'd be frightened to pass it too. Besides, those children aren't\n",
      "dead. They're all grown up and doing well . . . and one of them is a\n",
      "butcher. And flowers and songs couldn't have ghosts anyhow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne smothered a little sigh. She loved Diana dearly and they had always\n",
      "been good comrades. But she had long ago learned that when she wandered\n",
      "into the realm of fancy she must go alone. The way to it was by an\n",
      "enchanted path where not even her dearest might follow her.\n",
      "\n",
      "A thunder-shower came up while the girls were at Carmody; it did\n",
      "not last long, however, and the drive home, through lanes where the\n",
      "raindrops sparkled on the boughs and little leafy valleys where the\n",
      "drenched ferns gave out spicy odors, was delightful. But just as they\n",
      "turned into the Cuthbert lane Anne saw something that spoiled the beauty\n",
      "of the landscape for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before them on the right extended Mr. Harrison's broad, gray-green field\n",
      "of late oats, wet and luxuriant; and there, standing squarely in the\n",
      "middle of it, up to her sleek sides in the lush growth, and blinking at\n",
      "them calmly over the intervening tassels, was a Jersey cow!\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne dropped the reins and stood up with a tightening of the lips that\n",
      "boded no good to the predatory quadruped. Not a word said she, but she\n",
      "climbed nimbly down over the wheels, and whisked across the fence before\n",
      "Diana understood what had happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anne, come back,\" shrieked the latter, as soon as she found her voice.\n",
      "\"You'll ruin your dress in that wet grain . . . ruin it. She doesn't hear\n",
      "me! Well, she'll never get that cow out by herself. I must go and help\n",
      "her, of course.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne was charging through the grain like a mad thing. Diana hopped\n",
      "briskly down, tied the horse securely to a post, turned the skirt of her\n",
      "pretty gingham dress over her shoulders, mounted the fence, and started\n",
      "in pursuit of her frantic friend. She could run faster than Anne, who\n",
      "was hampered by her clinging and drenched skirt, and soon overtook her.\n",
      "Behind them they left a trail that would break Mr. Harrison's heart when\n",
      "he should see it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anne, for mercy's sake, stop,\" panted poor Diana. \"I'm right out of\n",
      "breath and you are wet to the skin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must . . . get . . . that cow . . . out . . . before . . . Mr.\n",
      "Harrison . . . sees her,\" gasped Anne. \"I don't . . . care . . . if I'm\n",
      ". . . drowned . . . if we . . . can . . . only . . . do that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Jersey cow appeared to see no good reason for being hustled out\n",
      "of her luscious browsing ground. No sooner had the two breathless girls\n",
      "got near her than she turned and bolted squarely for the opposite corner\n",
      "of the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Head her off,\" screamed Anne. \"Run, Diana, run.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Diana did run. Anne tried to, and the wicked Jersey went around the\n",
      "field as if she were possessed. Privately, Diana thought she was. It was\n",
      "fully ten minutes before they headed her off and drove her through the\n",
      "corner gap into the Cuthbert lane.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no denying that Anne was in anything but an angelic temper\n",
      "at that precise moment. Nor did it soothe her in the least to behold a\n",
      "buggy halted just outside the lane, wherein sat Mr. Shearer of Carmody\n",
      "and his son, both of whom wore a broad smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I guess you'd better have sold me that cow when I wanted to buy her\n",
      "last week, Anne,\" chuckled Mr. Shearer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll sell her to you now, if you want her,\" said her flushed and\n",
      "disheveled owner. \"You may have her this very minute.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Done. I'll give you twenty for her as I offered before, and Jim here\n",
      "can drive her right over to Carmody. She'll go to town with the rest of\n",
      "the shipment this evening. Mr. Reed of Brighton wants a Jersey cow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Five minutes later Jim Shearer and the Jersey cow were marching up the\n",
      "road, and impulsive Anne was driving along the Green Gables lane with\n",
      "her twenty dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What will Marilla say?\" asked Diana.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, she won't care. Dolly was my own cow and it isn't likely she'd\n",
      "bring more than twenty dollars at the auction. But oh dear, if Mr.\n",
      "Harrison sees that grain he will know she has been in again, and after\n",
      "my giving him my word of honor that I'd never let it happen! Well, it\n",
      "has taught me a lesson not to give my word of honor about cows. A cow\n",
      "that could jump over or break through our milk-pen fence couldn't be\n",
      "trusted anywhere.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marilla had gone down to Mrs. Lynde's, and when she returned knew all\n",
      "about Dolly's sale and transfer, for Mrs. Lynde had seen most of the\n",
      "transaction from her window and guessed the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose it's just as well she's gone, though you DO do things in a\n",
      "dreadful headlong fashion, Anne. I don't see how she got out of the pen,\n",
      "though. She must have broken some of the boards off.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't think of looking,\" said Anne, \"but I'll go and see now. Martin\n",
      "has never come back yet. Perhaps some more of his aunts have died. I\n",
      "think it's something like Mr. Peter Sloane and the octogenarians. The\n",
      "other evening Mrs. Sloane was reading a newspaper and she said to Mr.\n",
      "Sloane, 'I see here that another octogenarian has just died. What is an\n",
      "octogenarian, Peter?' And Mr. Sloane said he didn't know, but they must\n",
      "be very sickly creatures, for you never heard tell of them but they were\n",
      "dying. That's the way with Martin's aunts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Martin's just like all the rest of those French,\" said Marilla in\n",
      "disgust. \"You can't depend on them for a day.\" Marilla was looking over\n",
      "Anne's Carmody purchases when she heard a shrill shriek in the barnyard.\n",
      "A minute later Anne dashed into the kitchen, wringing her hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anne Shirley, what's the matter now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Marilla, whatever shall I do? This is terrible. And it's all my\n",
      "fault. Oh, will I EVER learn to stop and reflect a little before doing\n",
      "reckless things? Mrs. Lynde always told me I would do something dreadful\n",
      "some day, and now I've done it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anne, you are the most exasperating girl! WHAT is it you've done?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sold Mr. Harrison's Jersey cow . . . the one he bought from Mr. Bell\n",
      ". . . to Mr. Shearer! Dolly is out in the milking pen this very minute.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anne Shirley, are you dreaming?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I only wish I were. There's no dream about it, though it's very like a\n",
      "nightmare. And Mr. Harrison's cow is in Charlottetown by this time. Oh,\n",
      "Marilla, I thought I'd finished getting into scrapes, and here I am in\n",
      "the very worst one I ever was in in my life. What can I do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do? There's nothing to do, child, except go and see Mr. Harrison about\n",
      "it. We can offer him our Jersey in exchange if he doesn't want to take\n",
      "the money. She is just as good as his.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm sure he'll be awfully cross and disagreeable about it, though,\"\n",
      "moaned Anne.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I daresay he will. He seems to be an irritable sort of a man. I'll go\n",
      "and explain to him if you like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed, I'm not as mean as that,\" exclaimed Anne. \"This is all my\n",
      "fault and I'm certainly not going to let you take my punishment. I'll go\n",
      "myself and I'll go at once. The sooner it's over the better, for it will\n",
      "be terribly humiliating.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor Anne got her hat and her twenty dollars and was passing out when\n",
      "she happened to glance through the open pantry door. On the table\n",
      "reposed a nut cake which she had baked that morning . . . a particularly\n",
      "toothsome concoction iced with pink icing and adorned with walnuts. Anne\n",
      "had intended it for Friday evening, when the youth of Avonlea were to\n",
      "meet at Green Gables to organize the Improvement Society. But what were\n",
      "they compared to the justly offended Mr. Harrison? Anne thought that\n",
      "cake ought to soften the heart of any man, especially one who had to do\n",
      "his own cooking, and she promptly popped it into a box. She would take\n",
      "it to Mr. Harrison as a peace offering.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is, if he gives me a chance to say anything at all,\" she thought\n",
      "ruefully, as she climbed the lane fence and started on a short cut\n",
      "across the fields, golden in the light of the dreamy August evening. \"I\n",

      "III\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Harrison at Home\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Harrison's house was an old-fashioned, low-eaved, whitewashed\n",
      "structure, set against a thick spruce grove.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Harrison himself was sitting on his vineshaded veranda, in his shirt\n",
      "sleeves, enjoying his evening pipe. When he realized who was coming up\n",
      "the path he sprang suddenly to his feet, bolted into the house, and\n",
      "shut the door. This was merely the uncomfortable result of his surprise,\n",
      "mingled with a good deal of shame over his outburst of temper the day\n",
      "before. But it nearly swept the remnant of her courage from Anne's\n",
      "heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If he's so cross now what will he be when he hears what I've done,\" she\n",
      "reflected miserably, as she rapped at the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Mr. Harrison opened it, smiling sheepishly, and invited her to enter\n",
      "in a tone quite mild and friendly, if somewhat nervous. He had laid\n",
      "aside his pipe and donned his coat; he offered Anne a very dusty chair\n",
      "very politely, and her reception would have passed off pleasantly enough\n",
      "if it had not been for the telltale of a parrot who was peering through\n",
      "the bars of his cage with wicked golden eyes. No sooner had Anne seated\n",
      "herself than Ginger exclaimed,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless my soul, what's that redheaded snippet coming here for?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be hard to say whose face was the redder, Mr. Harrison's or\n",
      "Anne's.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you mind that parrot,\" said Mr. Harrison, casting a furious\n",
      "glance at Ginger. \"He's . . . he's always talking nonsense. I got him\n",
      "from my brother who was a sailor. Sailors don't always use the choicest\n",
      "language, and parrots are very imitative birds.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So I should think,\" said poor Anne, the remembrance of her errand\n",
      "quelling her resentment. She couldn't afford to snub Mr. Harrison under\n",
      "the circumstances, that was certain. When you had just sold a man's\n",
      "Jersey cow offhand, without his knowledge or consent you must not\n",
      "mind if his parrot repeated uncomplimentary things. Nevertheless, the\n",
      "\"redheaded snippet\" was not quite so meek as she might otherwise have\n",
      "been.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've come to confess something to you, Mr. Harrison,\" she said\n",
      "resolutely. \"It's . . . it's about . . . that Jersey cow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless my soul,\" exclaimed Mr. Harrison nervously, \"has she gone and\n",
      "broken into my oats again? Well, never mind . . . never mind if she has.\n",
      "It's no difference . . . none at all, I . . . I was too hasty yesterday,\n",
      "that's a fact. Never mind if she has.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, if it were only that,\" sighed Anne. \"But it's ten times worse. I\n",
      "don't . . .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless my soul, do you mean to say she's got into my wheat?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No . . . no . . . not the wheat. But . . .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then it's the cabbages! She's broken into my cabbages that I was\n",
      "raising for Exhibition, hey?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's NOT the cabbages, Mr. Harrison. I'll tell you everything . . .\n",
      "that is what I came for--but please don't interrupt me. It makes me so\n",
      "nervous. Just let me tell my story and don't say anything till I get\n",
      "through--and then no doubt you'll say plenty,\" Anne concluded, but in\n",
      "thought only.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I won't say another word,\" said Mr. Harrison, and he didn't. But\n",
      "Ginger was not bound by any contract of silence and kept ejaculating,\n",
      "\"Redheaded snippet\" at intervals until Anne felt quite wild.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shut my Jersey cow up in our pen yesterday. This morning I went to\n",
      "Carmody and when I came back I saw a Jersey cow in your oats. Diana and\n",
      "I chased her out and you can't imagine what a hard time we had. I was\n",
      "so dreadfully wet and tired and vexed--and Mr. Shearer came by that very\n",
      "minute and offered to buy the cow. I sold her to him on the spot for\n",
      "twenty dollars. It was wrong of me. I should have waited and consulted\n",
      "Marilla, of course. But I'm dreadfully given to doing things without\n",
      "thinking--everybody who knows me will tell you that. Mr. Shearer took\n",
      "the cow right away to ship her on the afternoon train.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Redheaded snippet,\" quoted Ginger in a tone of profound contempt.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point Mr. Harrison arose and, with an expression that would have\n",
      "struck terror into any bird but a parrot, carried Ginger's cage into an\n",
      "adjoining room and shut the door. Ginger shrieked, swore, and otherwise\n",
      "conducted himself in keeping with his reputation, but finding himself\n",
      "left alone, relapsed into sulky silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Excuse me and go on,\" said Mr. Harrison, sitting down again. \"My\n",
      "brother the sailor never taught that bird any manners.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I went home and after tea I went out to the milking pen. Mr.\n",
      "Harrison,\" . . . Anne leaned forward, clasping her hands with her old\n",
      "childish gesture, while her big gray eyes gazed imploringly into Mr.\n",
      "Harrison's embarrassed face . . . \"I found my cow still shut up in the\n",
      "pen. It was YOUR cow I had sold to Mr. Shearer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless my soul,\" exclaimed Mr. Harrison, in blank amazement at this\n",
      "unlooked-for conclusion. \"What a VERY extraordinary thing!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, it isn't in the least extraordinary that I should be getting myself\n",
      "and other people into scrapes,\" said Anne mournfully. \"I'm noted for\n",
      "that. You might suppose I'd have grown out of it by this time . . . I'll\n",
      "be seventeen next March . . . but it seems that I haven't. Mr. Harrison,\n",
      "is it too much to hope that you'll forgive me? I'm afraid it's too late\n",
      "to get your cow back, but here is the money for her . . . or you can have\n",
      "mine in exchange if you'd rather. She's a very good cow. And I can't\n",
      "express how sorry I am for it all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tut, tut,\" said Mr. Harrison briskly, \"don't say another word about it,\n",
      "miss. It's of no consequence . . . no consequence whatever. Accidents will\n",
      "happen. I'm too hasty myself sometimes, miss . . .  far too hasty. But I\n",
      "can't help speaking out just what I think and folks must take me as they\n",
      "find me. If that cow had been in my cabbages now . . . but never mind, she\n",
      "wasn't, so it's all right. I think I'd rather have your cow in exchange,\n",
      "since you want to be rid of her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, thank you, Mr. Harrison. I'm so glad you are not vexed. I was\n",
      "afraid you would be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I suppose you were scared to death to come here and tell me, after\n",
      "the fuss I made yesterday, hey? But you mustn't mind me, I'm a terrible\n",
      "outspoken old fellow, that's all . . . awful apt to tell the truth, no\n",
      "matter if it is a bit plain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So is Mrs. Lynde,\" said Anne, before she could prevent herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who? Mrs. Lynde? Don't you tell me I'm like that old gossip,\" said Mr.\n",
      "Harrison irritably. \"I'm not . . . not a bit. What have you got in that\n",
      "box?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A cake,\" said Anne archly. In her relief at Mr. Harrison's unexpected\n",
      "amiability her spirits soared upward feather-light. \"I brought it over\n",
      "for you . . . I thought perhaps you didn't have cake very often.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't, that's a fact, and I'm mighty fond of it, too. I'm much\n",
      "obliged to you. It looks good on top. I hope it's good all the way\n",
      "through.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is,\" said Anne, gaily confident. \"I have made cakes in my time that\n",
      "were NOT, as Mrs. Allan could tell you, but this one is all right. I\n",
      "made it for the Improvement Society, but I can make another for them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I'll tell you what, miss, you must help me eat it. I'll put the\n",
      "kettle on and we'll have a cup of tea. How will that do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Will you let me make the tea?\" said Anne dubiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Harrison chuckled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I see you haven't much confidence in my ability to make tea. You're\n",
      "wrong . . . I can brew up as good a jorum of tea as you ever drank. But go\n",
      "ahead yourself. Fortunately it rained last Sunday, so there's plenty of\n",
      "clean dishes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne hopped briskly up and went to work. She washed the teapot in\n",
      "several waters before she put the tea to steep. Then she swept the stove\n",
      "and set the table, bringing the dishes out of the pantry. The state of\n",
      "that pantry horrified Anne, but she wisely said nothing. Mr. Harrison\n",
      "told her where to find the bread and butter and a can of peaches. Anne\n",
      "adorned the table with a bouquet from the garden and shut her eyes to\n",
      "the stains on the tablecloth. Soon the tea was ready and Anne found\n",
      "herself sitting opposite Mr. Harrison at his own table, pouring his tea\n",
      "for him, and chatting freely to him about her school and friends and\n",
      "plans. She could hardly believe the evidence of her senses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Harrison had brought Ginger back, averring that the poor bird would\n",
      "be lonesome; and Anne, feeling that she could forgive everybody and\n",
      "everything, offered him a walnut. But Ginger's feelings had been\n",
      "grievously hurt and he rejected all overtures of friendship. He sat\n",
      "moodily on his perch and ruffled his feathers up until he looked like a\n",
      "mere ball of green and gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why do you call him Ginger?\" asked Anne, who liked appropriate names\n",
      "and thought Ginger accorded not at all with such gorgeous plumage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My brother the sailor named him. Maybe it had some reference to his\n",
      "temper. I think a lot of that bird though . . . you'd be surprised if you\n",
      "knew how much. He has his faults of course. That bird has cost me a good\n",
      "deal one way and another. Some people object to his swearing habits but\n",
      "he can't be broken of them. I've tried . . . other people have tried.\n",
      "Some folks have prejudices against parrots. Silly, ain't it? I like them\n",
      "myself. Ginger's a lot of company to me. Nothing would induce me to give\n",
      "that bird up . . . nothing in the world, miss.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Harrison flung the last sentence at Anne as explosively as if he\n",
      "suspected her of some latent design of persuading him to give Ginger up.\n",
      "Anne, however, was beginning to like the queer, fussy, fidgety little\n",
      "man, and before the meal was over they were quite good friends. Mr.\n",
      "Harrison found out about the Improvement Society and was disposed to\n",
      "approve of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's right. Go ahead. There's lots of room for improvement in this\n",
      "settlement . . . and in the people too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I don't know,\" flashed Anne. To herself, or to her particular\n",
      "cronies, she might admit that there were some small imperfections,\n",
      "easily removable, in Avonlea and its inhabitants. But to hear a\n",
      "practical outsider like Mr. Harrison saying it was an entirely different\n",
      "thing. \"I think Avonlea is a lovely place; and the people in it are very\n",
      "nice, too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I guess you've got a spice of temper,\" commented Mr. Harrison,\n",
      "surveying the flushed cheeks and indignant eyes opposite him. \"It goes\n",
      "with hair like yours, I reckon. Avonlea is a pretty decent place or I\n",
      "wouldn't have located here; but I suppose even you will admit that it\n",
      "has SOME faults?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I like it all the better for them,\" said loyal Anne. \"I don't like\n",
      "places or people either that haven't any faults. I think a truly perfect\n",
      "person would be very uninteresting. Mrs. Milton White says she never met\n",
      "a perfect person, but she's heard enough about one  . . . her husband's\n",
      "first wife. Don't you think it must be very uncomfortable to be married\n",
      "to a man whose first wife was perfect?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It would be more uncomfortable to be married to the perfect wife,\"\n",
      "declared Mr. Harrison, with a sudden and inexplicable warmth.\n",
      "\n",
      "When tea was over Anne insisted on washing the dishes, although Mr.\n",
      "Harrison assured her that there were enough in the house to do for weeks\n",
      "yet. She would dearly have loved to sweep the floor also, but no broom\n",
      "was visible and she did not like to ask where it was for fear there\n",
      "wasn't one at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You might run across and talk to me once in a while,\" suggested Mr.\n",
      "Harrison when she was leaving. \"'Tisn't far and folks ought to be\n",
      "neighborly. I'm kind of interested in that society of yours. Seems to me\n",
      "there'll be some fun in it. Who are you going to tackle first?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are not going to meddle with PEOPLE . . . it is only PLACES we mean to\n",
      "improve,\" said Anne, in a dignified tone. She rather suspected that Mr.\n",
      "Harrison was making fun of the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she had gone Mr. Harrison watched her from the window . . . a lithe,\n",
      "girlish shape, tripping lightheartedly across the fields in the sunset\n",
      "afterglow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm a crusty, lonesome, crabbed old chap,\" he said aloud, \"but there's\n",
      "something about that little girl makes me feel young again . . . and it's\n",
      "such a pleasant sensation I'd like to have it repeated once in a while.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Redheaded snippet,\" croaked Ginger mockingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Harrison shook his fist at the parrot.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You ornery bird,\" he muttered, \"I almost wish I'd wrung your neck when\n",
      "my brother the sailor brought you home. Will you never be done getting\n",
      "me into trouble?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne ran home blithely and recounted her adventures to Marilla, who had\n",
      "been not a little alarmed by her long absence and was on the point of\n",
      "starting out to look for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a pretty good world, after all, isn't it, Marilla?\" concluded Anne\n",
      "happily. \"Mrs. Lynde was complaining the other day that it wasn't much\n",
      "of a world. She said whenever you looked forward to anything pleasant\n",
      "you were sure to be more or less disappointed  . . . perhaps that is true.\n",
      "But there is a good side to it too. The bad things don't always come\n",
      "up to your expectations either  . . . they nearly always turn out ever so\n",
      "much better than you think. I looked forward to a dreadfully unpleasant\n",
      "experience when I went over to Mr. Harrison's tonight; and instead he\n",
      "was quite kind and I had almost a nice time. I think we're going to be\n",
      "real good friends if we make plenty of allowances for each other, and\n",
      "everything has turned out for the best. But all the same, Marilla, I\n",
      "shall certainly never again sell a cow before making sure to whom she\n",
      "belongs. And I do NOT like parrots!\"\n",

      "One evening at sunset, Jane Andrews, Gilbert Blythe, and Anne Shirley\n",
      "were lingering by a fence in the shadow of gently swaying spruce boughs,\n",
      "where a wood cut known as the Birch Path joined the main road. Jane had\n",
      "been up to spend the afternoon with Anne, who walked part of the way\n",
      "home with her; at the fence they met Gilbert, and all three were now\n",
      "talking about the fateful morrow; for that morrow was the first of\n",
      "September and the schools would open. Jane would go to Newbridge and\n",
      "Gilbert to White Sands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You both have the advantage of me,\" sighed Anne. \"You're going to teach\n",

      "and Mrs. Lynde says she's afraid they won't respect me as they would\n",
      "a stranger unless I'm very cross from the first. But I don't believe a\n",
      "teacher should be cross. Oh, it seems to me such a responsibility!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I guess we'll get on all right,\" said Jane comfortably. Jane was not\n",
      "troubled by any aspirations to be an influence for good. She meant to\n",
      "earn her salary fairly, please the trustees, and get her name on the\n",
      "School Inspector's roll of honor. Further ambitions Jane had none. \"The\n",
      "main thing will be to keep order and a teacher has to be a little cross\n",
      "to do that. If my pupils won't do as I tell them I shall punish them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Give them a good whipping, of course.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Jane, you wouldn't,\" cried Anne, shocked. \"Jane, you COULDN'T!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed, I could and would, if they deserved it,\" said Jane decidedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I could NEVER whip a child,\" said Anne with equal decision. \"I don't\n",
      "believe in it AT ALL. Miss Stacy never whipped any of us and she had\n",
      "perfect order; and Mr. Phillips was always whipping and he had no order\n",
      "at all. No, if I can't get along without whipping I shall not try to\n",
      "teach school. There are better ways of managing. I shall try to win my\n",
      "pupils' affections and then they will WANT to do what I tell them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But suppose they don't?\" said practical Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wouldn't whip them anyhow. I'm sure it wouldn't do any good. Oh,\n",
      "don't whip your pupils, Jane dear, no matter what they do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you think about it, Gilbert?\" demanded Jane. \"Don't you think\n",
      "there are some children who really need a whipping now and then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you think it's a cruel, barbarous thing to whip a child . . .  ANY\n",
      "child?\" exclaimed Anne, her face flushing with earnestness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Gilbert slowly, torn between his real convictions and his\n",
      "wish to measure up to Anne's ideal, \"there's something to be said on\n",
      "both sides. I don't believe in whipping children MUCH. I think, as you\n",
      "say, Anne, that there are better ways of managing as a rule, and that\n",
      "corporal punishment should be a last resort. But on the other hand,\n",
      "as Jane says, I believe there is an occasional child who can't be\n",
      "influenced in any other way and who, in short, needs a whipping and\n",
      "would be improved by it. Corporal punishment as a last resort is to be\n",
      "my rule.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Gilbert, having tried to please both sides, succeeded, as is usual and\n",
      "eminently right, in pleasing neither. Jane tossed her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll whip my pupils when they're naughty. It's the shortest and easiest\n",
      "way of convincing them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne gave Gilbert a disappointed glance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall never whip a child,\" she repeated firmly. \"I feel sure it isn't\n",
      "either right or necessary.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Suppose a boy sauced you back when you told him to do something?\" said\n",
      "Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'd keep him in after school and talk kindly and firmly to him,\" said\n",
      "Anne. \"There is some good in every person if you can find it. It is\n",
      "a teacher's duty to find and develop it. That is what our School\n",
      "Management professor at Queen's told us, you know. Do you suppose you\n",
      "could find any good in a child by whipping him? It's far more important\n",
      "to influence the children aright than it is even to teach them the three\n",
      "R's, Professor Rennie says.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But the Inspector examines them in the three R's, mind you, and he\n",
      "won't give you a good report if they don't come up to his standard,\"\n",
      "protested Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'd rather have my pupils love me and look back to me in after years as\n",
      "a real helper than be on the roll of honor,\" asserted Anne decidedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wouldn't you punish children at all, when they misbehaved?\" asked\n",
      "Gilbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, I suppose I shall have to, although I know I'll hate to do it.\n",
      "But you can keep them in at recess or stand them on the floor or give\n",
      "them lines to write.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose you won't punish the girls by making them sit with the boys?\"\n",
      "said Jane slyly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gilbert and Anne looked at each other and smiled rather foolishly. Once\n",
      "upon a time, Anne had been made to sit with Gilbert for punishment and\n",
      "sad and bitter had been the consequences thereof.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, time will tell which is the best way,\" said Jane philosophically\n",
      "as they parted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne went back to Green Gables by way of Birch Path, shadowy, rustling,\n",
      "fern-scented, through Violet Vale and past Willowmere, where dark and\n",
      "light kissed each other under the firs, and down through Lover's Lane\n",
      ". . . spots she and Diana had so named long ago. She walked slowly,\n",
      "enjoying the sweetness of wood and field and the starry summer twilight,\n",
      "and thinking soberly about the new duties she was to take up on the\n",
      "morrow. When she reached the yard at Green Gables Mrs. Lynde's loud,\n",
      "decided tones floated out through the open kitchen window.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mrs. Lynde has come up to give me good advice about tomorrow,\" thought\n",
      "Anne with a grimace, \"but I don't believe I'll go in. Her advice is\n",
      "much like pepper, I think . . . excellent in small quantities but rather\n",
      "scorching in her doses. I'll run over and have a chat with Mr. Harrison\n",
      "instead.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This was not the first time Anne had run over and chatted with Mr.\n",
      "Harrison since the notable affair of the Jersey cow. She had been\n",
      "there several evenings and Mr. Harrison and she were very good friends,\n",
      "although there were times and seasons when Anne found the outspokenness\n",
      "on which he prided himself rather trying. Ginger still continued to\n",
      "regard her with suspicion, and never failed to greet her sarcastically\n",
      "as \"redheaded snippet.\" Mr. Harrison had tried vainly to break him\n",
      "of the habit by jumping excitedly up whenever he saw Anne coming and\n",
      "exclaiming,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless my soul, here's that pretty little girl again,\" or something\n",
      "equally flattering. But Ginger saw through the scheme and scorned it.\n",
      "Anne was never to know how many compliments Mr. Harrison paid her behind\n",
      "her back. He certainly never paid her any to her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I suppose you've been back in the woods laying in a supply of\n",
      "switches for tomorrow?\" was his greeting as Anne came up the veranda\n",
      "steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed,\" said Anne indignantly. She was an excellent target for\n",
      "teasing because she always took things so seriously. \"I shall never have\n",
      "a switch in my school, Mr. Harrison. Of course, I shall have to have a\n",
      "pointer, but I shall use it for pointing ONLY.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So you mean to strap them instead? Well, I don't know but you're right.\n",
      "A switch stings more at the time but the strap smarts longer, that's a\n",
      "fact.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall not use anything of the sort. I'm not going to whip my pupils.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless my soul,\" exclaimed Mr. Harrison in genuine astonishment, \"how do\n",
      "you lay out to keep order then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall govern by affection, Mr. Harrison.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It won't do,\" said Mr. Harrison, \"won't do at all, Anne. 'Spare the\n",
      "rod and spoil the child.' When I went to school the master whipped me\n",
      "regular every day because he said if I wasn't in mischief just then I\n",
      "was plotting it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Methods have changed since your schooldays, Mr. Harrison.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But human nature hasn't. Mark my words, you'll never manage the young\n",
      "fry unless you keep a rod in pickle for them. The thing is impossible.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I'm going to try my way first,\" said Anne, who had a fairly\n",
      "strong will of her own and was apt to cling very tenaciously to her\n",
      "theories.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're pretty stubborn, I reckon,\" was Mr. Harrison's way of putting\n",
      "it. \"Well, well, we'll see. Someday when you get riled up . . . and people\n",
      "with hair like yours are desperate apt to get riled . . . you'll forget\n",
      "all your pretty little notions and give some of them a whaling. You're\n",
      "too young to be teaching anyhow  . . . far too young and childish.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Altogether, Anne went to bed that night in a rather pessimistic mood.\n",
      "She slept poorly and was so pale and tragic at breakfast next morning\n",
      "that Marilla was alarmed and insisted on making her take a cup of\n",
      "scorching ginger tea. Anne sipped it patiently, although she could not\n",
      "imagine what good ginger tea would do. Had it been some magic brew,\n",
      "potent to confer age and experience, Anne would have swallowed a quart\n",
      "of it without flinching.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Marilla, what if I fail!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll hardly fail completely in one day and there's plenty more days\n",
      "coming,\" said Marilla. \"The trouble with you, Anne, is that you'll\n",
      "expect to teach those children everything and reform all their faults\n",
      "right off, and if you can't you'll think you've failed.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When Anne reached the school that morning . . . for the first time in her\n",
      "life she had traversed the Birch Path deaf and blind to its beauties . . .\n",
      "all was quiet and still. The preceding teacher had trained the\n",
      "children to be in their places at her arrival, and when Anne entered the\n",
      "schoolroom she was confronted by prim rows of \"shining morning faces\"\n",
      "and bright, inquisitive eyes. She hung up her hat and faced her pupils,\n",
      "hoping that she did not look as frightened and foolish as she felt and\n",
      "that they would not perceive how she was trembling.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had sat up until nearly twelve the preceding night composing a\n",
      "speech she meant to make to her pupils upon opening the school. She had\n",
      "revised and improved it painstakingly, and then she had learned it off\n",
      "by heart. It was a very good speech and had some very fine ideas in it,\n",
      "especially about mutual help and earnest striving after knowledge. The\n",
      "only trouble was that she could not now remember a word of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "After what seemed to her a year . . . about ten seconds in reality . . .\n",
      "she said faintly, \"Take your Testaments, please,\" and sank breathlessly\n",
      "into her chair under cover of the rustle and clatter of desk lids that\n",
      "followed. While the children read their verses Anne marshalled her shaky\n",
      "wits into order and looked over the array of little pilgrims to the\n",
      "Grownup Land.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of them were, of course, quite well known to her. Her own\n",
      "classmates had passed out in the preceding year but the rest had all\n",
      "gone to school with her, excepting the primer class and ten newcomers\n",
      "to Avonlea. Anne secretly felt more interest in these ten than in those\n",
      "whose possibilities were already fairly well mapped out to her. To be\n",
      "sure, they might be just as commonplace as the rest; but on the other\n",
      "hand there MIGHT be a genius among them. It was a thrilling idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sitting by himself at a corner desk was Anthony Pye. He had a dark,\n",
      "sullen little face, and was staring at Anne with a hostile expression in\n",
      "his black eyes. Anne instantly made up her mind that she would win that\n",
      "boy's affection and discomfit the Pyes utterly.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the other corner another strange boy was sitting with Arty Sloane. . .\n",
      "a jolly looking little chap, with a snub nose, freckled face, and big,\n",
      "light blue eyes, fringed with whitish lashes . . .  probably the DonNELL\n",
      "boy; and if resemblance went for anything, his sister was sitting across\n",
      "the aisle with Mary Bell. Anne wondered what sort of mother the child\n",
      "had, to send her to school dressed as she was. She wore a faded pink\n",
      "silk dress, trimmed with a great deal of cotton lace, soiled white\n",
      "kid slippers, and silk stockings. Her sandy hair was tortured into\n",
      "innumerable kinky and unnatural curls, surmounted by a flamboyant bow\n",
      "of pink ribbon bigger than her head. Judging from her expression she was\n",
      "very well satisfied with herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "A pale little thing, with smooth ripples of fine, silky, fawn-colored\n",
      "hair flowing over her shoulders, must, Anne thought, be Annetta Bell,\n",
      "whose parents had formerly lived in the Newbridge school district, but,\n",
      "by reason of hauling their house fifty yards north of its old site were\n",
      "now in Avonlea. Three pallid little girls crowded into one seat were\n",
      "certainly Cottons; and there was no doubt that the small beauty with\n",
      "the long brown curls and hazel eyes, who was casting coquettish looks at\n",
      "Jack Gills over the edge of her Testament, was Prillie Rogerson, whose\n",
      "father had recently married a second wife and brought Prillie home from\n",
      "her grandmother's in Grafton. A tall, awkward girl in a back seat, who\n",
      "seemed to have too many feet and hands, Anne could not place at all, but\n",
      "later on discovered that her name was Barbara Shaw and that she had come\n",
      "to live with an Avonlea aunt. She was also to find that if Barbara ever\n",
      "managed to walk down the aisle without falling over her own or somebody\n",
      "else's feet the Avonlea scholars wrote the unusual fact up on the porch\n",
      "wall to commemorate it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when Anne's eyes met those of the boy at the front desk facing\n",
      "her own, a queer little thrill went over her, as if she had found her\n",
      "genius. She knew this must be Paul Irving and that Mrs. Rachel Lynde\n",
      "had been right for once when she prophesied that he would be unlike the\n",
      "Avonlea children. More than that, Anne realized that he was unlike other\n",
      "children anywhere, and that there was a soul subtly akin to her own\n",
      "gazing at her out of the very dark blue eyes that were watching her so\n",
      "intently.\n",
      "\n",
      "She knew Paul was ten but he looked no more than eight. He had the most\n",
      "beautiful little face she had ever seen in a child . . .  features of\n",
      "exquisite delicacy and refinement, framed in a halo of chestnut curls.\n",
      "His mouth was delicious, being full without pouting, the crimson lips\n",
      "just softly touching and curving into finely finished little corners\n",
      "that narrowly escaped being dimpled. He had a sober, grave, meditative\n",
      "expression, as if his spirit was much older than his body; but when\n",
      "Anne smiled softly at him it vanished in a sudden answering smile, which\n",
      "seemed an illumination of his whole being, as if some lamp had suddenly\n",
      "kindled into flame inside of him, irradiating him from top to toe. Best\n",
      "of all, it was involuntary, born of no external effort or motive, but\n",
      "simply the outflashing of a hidden personality, rare and fine and sweet.\n",
      "With a quick interchange of smiles Anne and Paul were fast friends\n",
      "forever before a word had passed between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The day went by like a dream. Anne could never clearly recall it\n",
      "afterwards. It almost seemed as if it were not she who was teaching\n",
      "but somebody else. She heard classes and worked sums and set copies\n",
      "mechanically. The children behaved quite well; only two cases of\n",
      "discipline occurred. Morley Andrews was caught driving a pair of trained\n",
      "crickets in the aisle. Anne stood Morley on the platform for an\n",
      "hour and . . . which Morley felt much more keenly . . .  confiscated his\n",
      "crickets. She put them in a box and on the way from school set them free\n",
      "in Violet Vale; but Morley believed, then and ever afterwards, that she\n",
      "took them home and kept them for her own amusement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other culprit was Anthony Pye, who poured the last drops of water\n",
      "from his slate bottle down the back of Aurelia Clay's neck. Anne kept\n",
      "Anthony in at recess and talked to him about what was expected of\n",
      "gentlemen, admonishing him that they never poured water down ladies'\n",
      "necks. She wanted all her boys to be gentlemen, she said. Her little\n",
      "lecture was quite kind and touching; but unfortunately Anthony remained\n",
      "absolutely untouched. He listened to her in silence, with the same\n",
      "sullen expression, and whistled scornfully as he went out. Anne\n",
      "sighed; and then cheered herself up by remembering that winning a Pye's\n",
      "affections, like the building of Rome, wasn't the work of a day. In\n",
      "fact, it was doubtful whether some of the Pyes had any affections to\n",
      "win; but Anne hoped better things of Anthony, who looked as if he might\n",
      "be a rather nice boy if one ever got behind his sullenness.\n",
      "\n",
      "When school was dismissed and the children had gone Anne dropped wearily\n",
      "into her chair. Her head ached and she felt woefully discouraged. There\n",
      "was no real reason for discouragement, since nothing very dreadful had\n",
      "occurred; but Anne was very tired and inclined to believe that she would\n",
      "never learn to like teaching. And how terrible it would be to be doing\n",
      "something you didn't like every day for . . . well, say forty years. Anne\n",
      "was of two minds whether to have her cry out then and there, or wait\n",
      "till she was safely in her own white room at home. Before she could\n",
      "decide there was a click of heels and a silken swish on the porch floor,\n",
      "and Anne found herself confronted by a lady whose appearance made her\n",
      "recall a recent criticism of Mr. Harrison's on an overdressed female he\n",
      "had seen in a Charlottetown store. \"She looked like a head-on collision\n",
      "between a fashion plate and a nightmare.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The newcomer was gorgeously arrayed in a pale blue summer silk, puffed,\n",
      "frilled, and shirred wherever puff, frill, or shirring could possibly\n",
      "be placed. Her head was surmounted by a huge white chiffon hat, bedecked\n",
      "with three long but rather stringy ostrich feathers. A veil of pink\n",
      "chiffon, lavishly sprinkled with huge black dots, hung like a flounce\n",
      "from the hat brim to her shoulders and floated off in two airy streamers\n",
      "behind her. She wore all the jewelry that could be crowded on one small\n",
      "woman, and a very strong odor of perfume attended her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am Mrs. DonNELL . . . Mrs. H. B. DonNELL,\" announced this vision, \"and\n",
      "I have come in to see you about something Clarice Almira told me when\n",
      "she came home to dinner today. It annoyed me EXCESSIVELY.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" faltered Anne, vainly trying to recollect any incident of\n",
      "the morning connected with the Donnell children.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Clarice Almira told me that you pronounced our name DONnell. Now, Miss\n",

      "the last syllable. I hope you'll remember this in future.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll try to,\" gasped Anne, choking back a wild desire to laugh. \"I know\n",
      "by experience that it's very unpleasant to have one's name SPELLED wrong\n",
      "and I suppose it must be even worse to have it pronounced wrong.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly it is. And Clarice Almira also informed me that you call my\n",
      "son Jacob.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He told me his name was Jacob,\" protested Anne.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I might well have expected that,\" said Mrs. H. B. Donnell, in a tone\n",
      "which implied that gratitude in children was not to be looked for in\n",
      "this degenerate age. \"That boy has such plebeian tastes, Miss Shirley.\n",
      "When he was born I wanted to call him St. Clair  . . . it sounds SO\n",
      "aristocratic, doesn't it? But his father insisted he should be called\n",

      "bachelor. And what do you think, Miss Shirley? When our innocent boy was\n",
      "five years old Uncle Jacob actually went and got married and now he has\n",

      "St. Clair I am determined he shall be called. His father obstinately\n",
      "continues to call him Jacob, and the boy himself has a perfectly\n",
      "unaccountable preference for the vulgar name. But St. Clair he is and\n",
      "St. Clair he shall remain. You will kindly remember this, Miss Shirley,\n",
      "will you not? THANK you. I told Clarice Almira that I was sure it was\n",

      "When Mrs. H. B. DonNELL had skimmed away Anne locked the school door and\n",
      "went home. At the foot of the hill she found Paul Irving by the Birch\n",
      "Path. He held out to her a cluster of the dainty little wild orchids\n",
      "which Avonlea children called \"rice lillies.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"You darling,\" said Anne, taking the fragrant spikes. As if Paul's words\n",
      "had been a spell of magic, discouragement and weariness passed from her\n",
      "spirit, and hope upwelled in her heart like a dancing fountain. She went\n",

      "secretary, and Diana Barry treasurer. The \"Improvers,\" as they were\n",
      "promptly christened, were to meet once a fortnight at the homes of\n",
      "the members. It was admitted that they could not expect to affect many\n",
      "improvements so late in the season; but they meant to plan the next\n",
      "summer's campaign, collect and discuss ideas, write and read papers,\n",
      "and, as Anne said, educate the public sentiment generally.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was some disapproval, of course, and . . . which the Improvers felt\n",
      "much more keenly . . . a good deal of ridicule. Mr. Elisha Wright was\n",
      "reported to have said that a more appropriate name for the organization\n",
      "would be Courting Club. Mrs. Hiram Sloane declared she had heard the\n",
      "Improvers meant to plough up all the roadsides and set them out with\n",
      "geraniums. Mr. Levi Boulter warned his neighbors that the Improvers\n",
      "would insist that everybody pull down his house and rebuild it after\n",
      "plans approved by the society. Mr. James Spencer sent them word that he\n",
      "wished they would kindly shovel down the church hill. Eben Wright told\n",
      "Anne that he wished the Improvers could induce old Josiah Sloane to\n",
      "keep his whiskers trimmed. Mr. Lawrence Bell said he would whitewash\n",
      "his barns if nothing else would please them but he would NOT hang lace\n",
      "curtains in the cowstable windows. Mr. Major Spencer asked Clifton\n",
      "Sloane, an Improver who drove the milk to the Carmody cheese factory,\n",
      "if it was true that everybody would have to have his milk-stand\n",
      "hand-painted next summer and keep an embroidered centerpiece on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of . . . or perhaps, human nature being what it is, because of\n",
      ". . . this, the Society went gamely to work at the only improvement they\n",
      "could hope to bring about that fall. At the second meeting, in the Barry\n",
      "parlor, Oliver Sloane moved that they start a subscription to re-shingle\n",
      "and paint the hall; Julia Bell seconded it, with an uneasy feeling that\n",
      "she was doing something not exactly ladylike. Gilbert put the motion,\n",
      "it was carried unanimously, and Anne gravely recorded it in her minutes.\n",
      "The next thing was to appoint a committee, and Gertie Pye, determined\n",
      "not to let Julia Bell carry off all the laurels, boldly moved that Miss\n",
      "Jane Andrews be chairman of said committee. This motion being also duly\n",
      "seconded and carried, Jane returned the compliment by appointing Gertie\n",
      "on the committee, along with Gilbert, Anne, Diana, and Fred Wright. The\n",
      "committee chose their routes in private conclave. Anne and Diana were\n",
      "told off for the Newbridge road, Gilbert and Fred for the White Sands\n",
      "road, and Jane and Gertie for the Carmody road.\n",
      "\n",

      "Eliza was there . . . very much so . . . and looked even grimmer than\n",
      "usual. Miss Eliza was one of those people who give you the impression\n",
      "that life is indeed a vale of tears, and that a smile, never to speak of\n",
      "a laugh, is a waste of nervous energy truly reprehensible. The Andrew\n",
      "girls had been \"girls\" for fifty odd years and seemed likely to remain\n",
      "girls to the end of their earthly pilgrimage. Catherine, it was said,\n",
      "had not entirely given up hope, but Eliza, who was born a pessimist, had\n",
      "never had any. They lived in a little brown house built in a sunny\n",
      "corner scooped out of Mark Andrew's beech woods. Eliza complained that\n",
      "it was terrible hot in summer, but Catherine was wont to say it was\n",
      "lovely and warm in winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eliza was sewing patchwork, not because it was needed but simply as\n",
      "a protest against the frivolous lace Catherine was crocheting. Eliza\n",
      "listened with a frown and Catherine with a smile, as the girls explained\n",
      "their errand. To be sure, whenever Catherine caught Eliza's eye she\n",
      "discarded the smile in guilty confusion; but it crept back the next\n",
      "moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I had money to waste,\" said Eliza grimly, \"I'd burn it up and have\n",
      "the fun of seeing a blaze maybe; but I wouldn't give it to that hall,\n",
      "not a cent. It's no benefit to the settlement . . . just a place for young\n",
      "folks to meet and carry on when they's better be home in their beds.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Eliza, young folks must have some amusement,\" protested Catherine.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't see the necessity. We didn't gad about to halls and places when\n",
      "we were young, Catherine Andrews. This world is getting worse every day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think it's getting better,\" said Catherine firmly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"YOU think!\" Miss Eliza's voice expressed the utmost contempt. \"It\n",
      "doesn't signify what you THINK, Catherine Andrews. Facts is facts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I always like to look on the bright side, Eliza.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You won't have such a high opinion of it when you've lived as long\n",
      "in it as I have,\" retorted Miss Eliza sourly, \"and you won't be so\n",
      "enthusiastic about improving it either. How is your mother, Diana? Dear\n",
      "me, but she has failed of late. She looks terrible run down. And how\n",
      "long is it before Marilla expects to be stone blind, Anne?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Doctors always talk like that just to keep people cheered up. I\n",

      "but I haven't much hope of it.\"\n",

      "excitedly. It was Catherine Andrews and she was so out of breath that\n",

      "hand.\n",

      "Of course, I had to rebuke him again for using such shocking language.\n",

      "as a fighting animal? . . . and I want to fight disease and pain and\n",
      "ignorance . . . which are all members one of another. I want to do my\n",
      "share of honest, real work in the world, Anne . . .  add a little to the\n",
      "sum of human knowledge that all the good men have been accumulating\n",
      "since it began. The folks who lived before me have done so much for me\n",
      "that I want to show my gratitude by doing something for the folks who\n",

      "\"Well, I ain't going to let anybody else pull it,\" said Davy, doubling\n",
      "up his fists and frowning. \"They'd just better try it. I didn't hurt her\n",
      "much . . . she just cried 'cause she's a girl. I'm glad I'm a boy but I'm\n",
      "sorry I'm a twin. When Jimmy Sprott's sister conterdicks him he just\n",
      "says, 'I'm oldern you, so of course I know better,' and that settles\n",
      "HER. But I can't tell Dora that, and she just goes on thinking diffrunt\n",
      "from me. You might let me drive the gee-gee for a spell, since I'm a\n",
      "man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Altogether, Marilla was a thankful woman when she drove into her own\n",
      "yard, where the wind of the autumn night was dancing with the brown\n",
      "leaves. Anne was at the gate to meet them and lift the twins out. Dora\n",
      "submitted calmly to be kissed, but Davy responded to Anne's welcome\n",
      "with one of his hearty hugs and the cheerful announcement, \"I'm Mr. Davy\n",
      "Keith.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At the supper table Dora behaved like a little lady, but Davy's manners\n",
      "left much to be desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm so hungry I ain't got time to eat p'litely,\" he said when Marilla\n",
      "reproved him. \"Dora ain't half as hungry as I am. Look at all the\n",
      "ex'cise I took on the road here. That cake's awful nice and plummy. We\n",
      "haven't had any cake at home for ever'n ever so long, 'cause mother was\n",
      "too sick to make it and Mrs. Sprott said it was as much as she could do\n",
      "to bake our bread for us. And Mrs. Wiggins never puts any plums in HER\n",
      "cakes. Catch her! Can I have another piece?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marilla would have refused but Anne cut a generous second slice.\n",
      "However, she reminded Davy that he ought to say \"Thank you\" for it. Davy\n",
      "merely grinned at her and took a huge bite. When he had finished the\n",
      "slice he said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you'll give me ANOTHER piece I'll say thank you for IT.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, you have had plenty of cake,\" said Marilla in a tone which Anne\n",
      "knew and Davy was to learn to be final.\n",
      "\n",
      "Davy winked at Anne, and then, leaning over the table, snatched Dora's\n",
      "first piece of cake, from which she had just taken one dainty little\n",
      "bite, out of her very fingers and, opening his mouth to the fullest\n",
      "extent, crammed the whole slice in. Dora's lip trembled and Marilla\n",
      "was speechless with horror. Anne promptly exclaimed, with her best\n",
      "\"schoolma'am\" air,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Davy, gentlemen don't do things like that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know they don't,\" said Davy, as soon as he could speak, \"but I ain't\n",
      "a gemplum.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But don't you want to be?\" said shocked Anne.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Course I do. But you can't be a gemplum till you grow up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, indeed you can,\" Anne hastened to say, thinking she saw a chance to\n",
      "sow good seed betimes. \"You can begin to be a gentleman when you are a\n",
      "little boy. And gentlemen NEVER snatch things from ladies . . .  or forget\n",
      "to say thank you . . . or pull anybody's hair.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They don't have much fun, that's a fact,\" said Davy frankly. \"I guess\n",
      "I'll wait till I'm grown up to be one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marilla, with a resigned air, had cut another piece of cake for Dora.\n",
      "She did not feel able to cope with Davy just then. It had been a hard\n",
      "day for her, what with the funeral and the long drive. At that moment\n",
      "she looked forward to the future with a pessimism that would have done\n",
      "credit to Eliza Andrews herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The twins were not noticeably alike, although both were fair. Dora had\n",
      "long sleek curls that never got out of order. Davy had a crop of fuzzy\n",
      "little yellow ringlets all over his round head. Dora's hazel eyes were\n",
      "gentle and mild; Davy's were as roguish and dancing as an elf's. Dora's\n",
      "nose was straight, Davy's a positive snub; Dora had a \"prunes and\n",
      "prisms\" mouth, Davy's was all smiles; and besides, he had a dimple\n",
      "in one cheek and none in the other, which gave him a dear, comical,\n",
      "lopsided look when he laughed. Mirth and mischief lurked in every corner\n",
      "of his little face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They'd better go to bed,\" said Marilla, who thought it was the easiest\n",
      "way to dispose of them. \"Dora will sleep with me and you can put Davy in\n",
      "the west gable. You're not afraid to sleep alone, are you, Davy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; but I ain't going to bed for ever so long yet,\" said Davy\n",
      "comfortably.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, you are.\" That was all the much-tried Marilla said, but\n",
      "something in her tone squelched even Davy. He trotted obediently\n",
      "upstairs with Anne.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When I'm grown up the very first thing I'm going to do is stay up ALL\n",
      "night just to see what it would be like,\" he told her confidentially.\n",
      "\n",
      "In after years Marilla never thought of that first week of the twins'\n",
      "sojourn at Green Gables without a shiver. Not that it really was so much\n",
      "worse than the weeks that followed it; but it seemed so by reason of its\n",
      "novelty. There was seldom a waking minute of any day when Davy was not\n",
      "in mischief or devising it; but his first notable exploit occurred two\n",
      "days after his arrival, on Sunday morning . . . a fine, warm day, as\n",
      "hazy and mild as September. Anne dressed him for church while Marilla\n",
      "attended to Dora. Davy at first objected strongly to having his face\n",
      "washed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Marilla washed it yesterday . . . and Mrs. Wiggins scoured me with hard\n",
      "soap the day of the funeral. That's enough for one week. I don't see the\n",
      "good of being so awful clean. It's lots more comfable being dirty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Paul Irving washes his face every day of his own accord,\" said Anne\n",
      "astutely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Davy had been an inmate of Green Gables for little over forty-eight\n",
      "hours; but he already worshipped Anne and hated Paul Irving, whom he had\n",
      "heard Anne praising enthusiastically the day after his arrival. If Paul\n",
      "Irving washed his face every day, that settled it. He, Davy Keith,\n",
      "would do it too, if it killed him. The same consideration induced him\n",
      "to submit meekly to the other details of his toilet, and he was really\n",
      "a handsome little lad when all was done. Anne felt an almost maternal\n",
      "pride in him as she led him into the old Cuthbert pew.\n",
      "\n",
      "Davy behaved quite well at first, being occupied in casting covert\n",
      "glances at all the small boys within view and wondering which was\n",
      "Paul Irving. The first two hymns and the Scripture reading passed off\n",
      "uneventfully. Mr. Allan was praying when the sensation came.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lauretta White was sitting in front of Davy, her head slightly bent\n",
      "and her fair hair hanging in two long braids, between which a tempting\n",
      "expanse of white neck showed, encased in a loose lace frill. Lauretta\n",
      "was a fat, placid-looking child of eight, who had conducted herself\n",
      "irreproachably in church from the very first day her mother carried her\n",
      "there, an infant of six months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Davy thrust his hand into his pocket and produced . . . a caterpillar, a\n",
      "furry, squirming caterpillar. Marilla saw and clutched at him but she\n",
      "was too late. Davy dropped the caterpillar down Lauretta's neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right into the middle of Mr. Allan's prayer burst a series of piercing\n",
      "shrieks. The minister stopped appalled and opened his eyes. Every head\n",
      "in the congregation flew up. Lauretta White was dancing up and down in\n",
      "her pew, clutching frantically at the back of her dress.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ow . . . mommer . . . mommer . . . ow . . . take it off . . . ow . . .\n",
      "get it out . . . ow . . . that bad boy put it down my neck . . . ow . . .\n",
      "mommer . . . it's going further down . . . ow . . . ow . . . ow. . . .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. White rose and with a set face carried the hysterical, writhing\n",
      "Lauretta out of church. Her shrieks died away in the distance and Mr.\n",
      "Allan proceeded with the service. But everybody felt that it was a\n",
      "failure that day. For the first time in her life Marilla took no notice\n",
      "of the text and Anne sat with scarlet cheeks of mortification.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they got home Marilla put Davy to bed and made him stay there for\n",
      "the rest of the day. She would not give him any dinner but allowed him a\n",
      "plain tea of bread and milk. Anne carried it to him and sat sorrowfully\n",
      "by him while he ate it with an unrepentant relish. But Anne's mournful\n",
      "eyes troubled him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I s'pose,\" he said reflectively, \"that Paul Irving wouldn't have\n",
      "dropped a caterpillar down a girl's neck in church, would he?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed he wouldn't,\" said Anne sadly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I'm kind of sorry I did it, then,\" conceded Davy. \"But it was\n",
      "such a jolly big caterpillar . . . I picked him up on the church steps\n",
      "just as we went in. It seemed a pity to waste him. And say, wasn't it\n",
      "fun to hear that girl yell?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tuesday afternoon the Aid Society met at Green Gables. Anne hurried home\n",
      "from school, for she knew that Marilla would need all the assistance she\n",
      "could give. Dora, neat and proper, in her nicely starched white dress\n",
      "and black sash, was sitting with the members of the Aid in the parlor,\n",
      "speaking demurely when spoken to, keeping silence when not, and in every\n",
      "way comporting herself as a model child. Davy, blissfully dirty, was\n",
      "making mud pies in the barnyard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I told him he might,\" said Marilla wearily. \"I thought it would keep\n",
      "him out of worse mischief. He can only get dirty at that. We'll have our\n",
      "teas over before we call him to his. Dora can have hers with us, but\n",
      "I would never dare to let Davy sit down at the table with all the Aids\n",
      "here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When Anne went to call the Aids to tea she found that Dora was not in\n",
      "the parlor. Mrs. Jasper Bell said Davy had come to the front door and\n",
      "called her out. A hasty consultation with Marilla in the pantry resulted\n",
      "in a decision to let both children have their teas together later on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tea was half over when the dining room was invaded by a forlorn figure.\n",
      "Marilla and Anne stared in dismay, the Aids in amazement. Could that be\n",
      "Dora . . . that sobbing nondescript in a drenched, dripping dress and hair\n",
      "from which the water was streaming on Marilla's new coin-spot rug?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dora, what has happened to you?\" cried Anne, with a guilty glance at\n",
      "Mrs. Jasper Bell, whose family was said to be the only one in the world\n",
      "in which accidents never occurred.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Davy made me walk the pigpen fence,\" wailed Dora. \"I didn't want to but\n",
      "he called me a fraid-cat. And I fell off into the pigpen and my dress\n",
      "got all dirty and the pig runned right over me. My dress was just awful\n",
      "but Davy said if I'd stand under the pump he'd wash it clean, and I did\n",
      "and he pumped water all over me but my dress ain't a bit cleaner and my\n",
      "pretty sash and shoes is all spoiled.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne did the honors of the table alone for the rest of the meal while\n",
      "Marilla went upstairs and redressed Dora in her old clothes. Davy was\n",
      "caught and sent to bed without any supper. Anne went to his room at\n",
      "twilight and talked to him seriously . . . a method in which she had great\n",
      "faith, not altogether unjustified by results. She told him she felt very\n",
      "badly over his conduct.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I feel sorry now myself,\" admitted Davy, \"but the trouble is I never\n",
      "feel sorry for doing things till after I've did them. Dora wouldn't help\n",
      "me make pies, cause she was afraid of messing her clo'es and that made\n",
      "me hopping mad. I s'pose Paul Irving wouldn't have made HIS sister walk\n",
      "a pigpen fence if he knew she'd fall in?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, he would never dream of such a thing. Paul is a perfect little\n",
      "gentleman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Davy screwed his eyes tight shut and seemed to meditate on this for a\n",
      "time. Then he crawled up and put his arms about Anne's neck, snuggling\n",
      "his flushed little face down on her shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anne, don't you like me a little bit, even if I ain't a good boy like\n",
      "Paul?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed I do,\" said Anne sincerely. Somehow, it was impossible to help\n",
      "liking Davy. \"But I'd like you better still if you weren't so naughty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I . . . did something else today,\" went on Davy in a muffled voice. \"I'm\n",
      "sorry now but I'm awful scared to tell you. You won't be very cross,\n",
      "will you? And you won't tell Marilla, will you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know, Davy. Perhaps I ought to tell her. But I think I can\n",
      "promise you I won't if you promise me that you will never do it again,\n",
      "whatever it is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I never will. Anyhow, it's not likely I'd find any more of them\n",
      "this year. I found this one on the cellar steps.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Davy, what is it you've done?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I put a toad in Marilla's bed. You can go and take it out if you like.\n",
      "But say, Anne, wouldn't it be fun to leave it there?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Davy Keith!\" Anne sprang from Davy's clinging arms and flew across the\n",
      "hall to Marilla's room. The bed was slightly rumpled. She threw back the\n",
      "blankets in nervous haste and there in very truth was the toad, blinking\n",
      "at her from under a pillow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can I carry that awful thing out?\" moaned Anne with a shudder. The\n",
      "fire shovel suggested itself to her and she crept down to get it while\n",
      "Marilla was busy in the pantry. Anne had her own troubles carrying that\n",
      "toad downstairs, for it hopped off the shovel three times and once she\n",
      "thought she had lost it in the hall. When she finally deposited it in\n",
      "the cherry orchard she drew a long breath of relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If Marilla knew she'd never feel safe getting into bed again in her\n",
      "life. I'm so glad that little sinner repented in time. There's Diana\n",
      "signaling to me from her window. I'm glad . . . I really feel the need of\n",

      "the world but after breakfast he declared it didn't . . . that it went\n",

      "Mr. Roger Pye brought the hall paint home that night and Mr. Joshua Pye,\n",
      "a surly, taciturn man, began painting the next day. He was not disturbed\n",
      "in his task. The hall was situated on what was called \"the lower road.\"\n",
      "In late autumn this road was always muddy and wet, and people going to\n",
      "Carmody traveled by the longer \"upper\" road. The hall was so closely\n",
      "surrounded by fir woods that it was invisible unless you were near it.\n",
      "Mr. Joshua Pye painted away in the solitude and independence that were\n",
      "so dear to his unsociable heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Friday afternoon he finished his job and went home to Carmody. Soon\n",
      "after his departure Mrs. Rachel Lynde drove by, having braved the mud of\n",
      "the lower road out of curiosity to see what the hall looked like in its\n",
      "new coat of paint. When she rounded the spruce curve she saw.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sight affected Mrs. Lynde oddly. She dropped the reins, held up her\n",
      "hands, and said \"Gracious Providence!\" She stared as if she could not\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "to tell them about the hall. The news flew like wildfire. Gilbert\n",
      "Blythe, poring over a text book at home, heard it from his father's\n",
      "hired boy at sunset, and rushed breathlessly to Green Gables, joined on\n",

      "Shirley, despair personified, at the yard gate of Green Gables, under\n",
      "the big leafless willows.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It isn't true surely, Anne?\" exclaimed Gilbert.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is true,\" answered Anne, looking like the muse of tragedy. \"Mrs.\n",
      "Lynde called on her way from Carmody to tell me. Oh, it is simply\n",
      "dreadful! What is the use of trying to improve anything?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is dreadful?\" asked Oliver Sloane, arriving at this moment with a\n",
      "bandbox he had brought from town for Marilla.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Haven't you heard?\" said Jane wrathfully. \"Well, its simply this. . .\n",
      "Joshua Pye has gone and painted the hall blue instead of green. . .\n",
      "a deep, brilliant blue, the shade they use for painting carts and\n",
      "wheelbarrows. And Mrs. Lynde says it is the most hideous color for a\n",
      "building, especially when combined with a red roof, that she ever saw\n",
      "or imagined. You could simply have knocked me down with a feather when I\n",
      "heard it. It's heartbreaking, after all the trouble we've had.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How on earth could such a mistake have happened?\" wailed Diana.\n",
      "\n",
      "The blame of this unmerciful disaster was eventually narrowed down to\n",
      "the Pyes. The Improvers had decided to use Morton-Harris paints and\n",
      "the Morton-Harris paint cans were numbered according to a color card.\n",
      "A purchaser chose his shade on the card and ordered by the accompanying\n",
      "number. Number 147 was the shade of green desired and when Mr. Roger Pye\n",
      "sent word to the Improvers by his son, John Andrew, that he was going to\n",
      "town and would get their paint for them, the Improvers told John Andrew\n",
      "to tell his father to get 147. John Andrew always averred that he did\n",
      "so, but Mr. Roger Pye as stanchly declared that John Andrew told him\n",
      "157; and there the matter stands to this day.\n",
      "\n",
      "That night there was blank dismay in every Avonlea house where an\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I must cry, even if I am almost seventeen, Marilla,\" she sobbed. \"It\n",

      "\n",
      "In life, as in dreams, however, things often go by contraries. The\n",
      "Avonlea people did not laugh; they were too angry. Their money had\n",
      "gone to paint the hall and consequently they felt themselves bitterly\n",
      "aggrieved by the mistake. Public indignation centered on the Pyes. Roger\n",
      "Pye and John Andrew had bungled the matter between them; and as for\n",
      "Joshua Pye, he must be a born fool not to suspect there was something\n",
      "wrong when he opened the cans and saw the color of the paint. Joshua\n",
      "Pye, when thus animadverted upon, retorted that the Avonlea taste in\n",
      "colors was no business of his, whatever his private opinion might be; he\n",
      "had been hired to paint the hall, not to talk about it; and he meant to\n",
      "have his money for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Improvers paid him his money in bitterness of spirit, after\n",
      "consulting Mr. Peter Sloane, who was a magistrate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll have to pay it,\" Peter told him. \"You can't hold him responsible\n",
      "for the mistake, since he claims he was never told what the color was\n",
      "supposed to be but just given the cans and told to go ahead. But it's a\n",
      "burning shame and that hall certainly does look awful.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The luckless Improvers expected that Avonlea would be more prejudiced\n",
      "than ever against them; but instead, public sympathy veered around in\n",
      "their favor. People thought the eager, enthusiastic little band who had\n",
      "worked so hard for their object had been badly used. Mrs. Lynde told\n",
      "them to keep on and show the Pyes that there really were people in the\n",
      "world who could do things without making a muddle of them. Mr. Major\n",
      "Spencer sent them word that he would clean out all the stumps along the\n",
      "road front of his farm and seed it down with grass at his own expense;\n",
      "and Mrs. Hiram Sloane called at the school one day and beckoned Anne\n",
      "mysteriously out into the porch to tell her that if the \"Sassiety\"\n",
      "wanted to make a geranium bed at the crossroads in the spring they\n",
      "needn't be afraid of her cow, for she would see that the marauding\n",
      "animal was kept within safe bounds. Even Mr. Harrison chuckled, if he\n",
      "chuckled at all, in private, and was all sympathy outwardly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind, Anne. Most paints fade uglier every year but that blue is\n",
      "as ugly as it can be to begin with, so it's bound to fade prettier. And\n",
      "the roof is shingled and painted all right. Folks will be able to sit in\n",

      "effects of toothache that she did not once try to coquette with the\n",

      "usually such a disagreeable month . . . as if the year had suddenly found\n",
      "out that she was growing old and could do nothing but weep and fret over\n",
      "it. This year is growing old gracefully . . . just like a stately old lady\n",
      "who knows she can be charming even with gray hair and wrinkles. We've\n",
      "had lovely days and delicious twilights. This last fortnight has been so\n",
      "peaceful, and even Davy has been almost well-behaved. I really think\n",
      "he is improving a great deal. How quiet the woods are today . . .  not\n",

      "brilliant and triumphant and splendid . . .  a great prima donna or a Red\n",
      "Cross nurse or a queen. Last night I was a queen. It's really splendid\n",
      "to imagine you are a queen. You have all the fun of it without any of\n",
      "the inconveniences and you can stop being a queen whenever you want to,\n",
      "which you couldn't in real life. But here in the woods I like best to\n",
      "imagine quite different things . . . I'm a dryad living in an old pine, or\n",
      "a little brown wood-elf hiding under a crinkled leaf. That white birch\n",
      "you caught me kissing is a sister of mine. The only difference is, she's\n",
      "a tree and I'm a girl, but that's no real difference. Where are you\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Down to the Dicksons. I promised to help Alberta cut out her new dress.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I've been away ever since one o'clock,\" said Marilla. \"Thomas Lynde\n",

      "I left here Dora was playing with her doll in the kitchen and Davy was\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Neither I did,\" avowed Davy solemnly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She must be somewhere around,\" said Anne. \"She would never wander far\n",
      "away alone . . . you know how timid she is. Perhaps she has fallen asleep\n",
      "in one of the rooms.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I've hunted the whole house through. But she may be in some of the\n",
      "buildings.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A thorough search followed. Every corner of house, yard, and\n",
      "outbuildings was ransacked by those two distracted people. Anne roved\n",
      "the orchards and the Haunted Wood, calling Dora's name. Marilla took a\n",
      "candle and explored the cellar. Davy accompanied each of them in turn,\n",
      "and was fertile in thinking of places where Dora could possibly be.\n",
      "Finally they met again in the yard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a most mysterious thing,\" groaned Marilla.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where can she be?\" said Anne miserably\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Maybe she's tumbled into the well,\" suggested Davy cheerfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne and Marilla looked fearfully into each other's eyes. The thought\n",
      "had been with them both through their entire search but neither had\n",
      "dared to put it into words.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She . . . she might have,\" whispered Marilla.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne, feeling faint and sick, went to the wellbox and peered over. The\n",
      "bucket sat on the shelf inside. Far down below was a tiny glimmer of\n",
      "still water. The Cuthbert well was the deepest in Avonlea. If Dora. . .\n",
      "but Anne could not face the idea. She shuddered and turned away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Run across for Mr. Harrison,\" said Marilla, wringing her hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Harrison and John Henry are both away . . . they went to town today.\n",
      "I'll go for Mr. Barry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Barry came back with Anne, carrying a coil of rope to which was\n",
      "attached a claw-like instrument that had been the business end of a\n",
      "grubbing fork. Marilla and Anne stood by, cold and shaken with horror\n",
      "and dread, while Mr. Barry dragged the well, and Davy, astride the gate,\n",
      "watched the group with a face indicative of huge enjoyment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally Mr. Barry shook his head, with a relieved air.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She can't be down there. It's a mighty curious thing where she could\n",
      "have got to, though. Look here, young man, are you sure you've no idea\n",
      "where your sister is?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've told you a dozen times that I haven't,\" said Davy, with an injured\n",
      "air. \"Maybe a tramp come and stole her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nonsense,\" said Marilla sharply, relieved from her horrible fear of\n",
      "the well. \"Anne, do you suppose she could have strayed over to Mr.\n",
      "Harrison's? She has always been talking about his parrot ever since that\n",
      "time you took her over.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't believe Dora would venture so far alone but I'll go over and\n",
      "see,\" said Anne.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody was looking at Davy just then or it would have been seen that a\n",
      "very decided change came over his face. He quietly slipped off the gate\n",
      "and ran, as fast as his fat legs could carry him, to the barn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne hastened across the fields to the Harrison establishment in no\n",
      "very hopeful frame of mind. The house was locked, the window shades\n",
      "were down, and there was no sign of anything living about the place. She\n",
      "stood on the veranda and called Dora loudly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ginger, in the kitchen behind her, shrieked and swore with sudden\n",
      "fierceness; but between his outbursts Anne heard a plaintive cry\n",
      "from the little building in the yard which served Mr. Harrison as a\n",
      "toolhouse. Anne flew to the door, unhasped it, and caught up a small\n",
      "mortal with a tearstained face who was sitting forlornly on an upturned\n",
      "nail keg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Dora, Dora, what a fright you have given us! How came you to be\n",
      "here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Davy and I came over to see Ginger,\" sobbed Dora, \"but we couldn't see\n",
      "him after all, only Davy made him swear by kicking the door. And then\n",
      "Davy brought me here and run out and shut the door; and I couldn't get\n",
      "out. I cried and cried, I was frightened, and oh, I'm so hungry and\n",
      "cold; and I thought you'd never come, Anne.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Davy?\" But Anne could say no more. She carried Dora home with a heavy\n",
      "heart. Her joy at finding the child safe and sound was drowned out in\n",
      "the pain caused by Davy's behavior. The freak of shutting Dora up might\n",
      "easily have been pardoned. But Davy had told falsehoods . . . downright\n",
      "coldblooded falsehoods about it. That was the ugly fact and Anne could\n",
      "not shut her eyes to it. She could have sat down and cried with sheer\n",
      "disappointment. She had grown to love Davy dearly . . . how dearly she had\n",
      "not known until this minute . . . and it hurt her unbearably to discover\n",
      "that he was guilty of deliberate falsehood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marilla listened to Anne's tale in a silence that boded no good\n",
      "Davy-ward; Mr. Barry laughed and advised that Davy be summarily dealt\n",
      "with. When he had gone home Anne soothed and warmed the sobbing,\n",
      "shivering Dora, got her her supper and put her to bed. Then she returned\n",
      "to the kitchen, just as Marilla came grimly in, leading, or rather\n",
      "pulling, the reluctant, cobwebby Davy, whom she had just found hidden\n",
      "away in the darkest corner of the stable.\n",
      "\n",
      "She jerked him to the mat on the middle of the floor and then went and\n",
      "sat down by the east window. Anne was sitting limply by the west window.\n",
      "Between them stood the culprit. His back was toward Marilla and it was\n",
      "a meek, subdued, frightened back; but his face was toward Anne and\n",
      "although it was a little shamefaced there was a gleam of comradeship\n",
      "in Davy's eyes, as if he knew he had done wrong and was going to be\n",
      "punished for it, but could count on a laugh over it all with Anne later\n",
      "on.\n",
      "\n",
      "But no half hidden smile answered him in Anne's gray eyes, as there\n",
      "might have done had it been only a question of mischief. There was\n",
      "something else . . . something ugly and repulsive.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How could you behave so, Davy?\" she asked sorrowfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "Davy squirmed uncomfortably.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I just did it for fun. Things have been so awful quiet here for so long\n",

      "too.\"\n",

      "In spite of fear and a little remorse Davy grinned over the\n",
      "recollection.\n",
      "\n",

      "than ever.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What's a falsehood? Do you mean a whopper?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I mean a story that was not true.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Course I did,\" said Davy frankly. \"If I hadn't you wouldn't have been\n",
      "scared. I HAD to tell it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne was feeling the reaction from her fright and exertions. Davy's\n",
      "impenitent attitude gave the finishing touch. Two big tears brimmed up\n",
      "in her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Davy, how could you?\" she said, with a quiver in her voice. \"Don't\n",
      "you know how wrong it was?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Davy was aghast. Anne crying . . . he had made Anne cry! A flood of real\n",
      "remorse rolled like a wave over his warm little heart and engulfed it.\n",
      "He rushed to Anne, hurled himself into her lap, flung his arms around\n",
      "her neck, and burst into tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't know it was wrong to tell whoppers,\" he sobbed. \"How did you\n",
      "expect me to know it was wrong? All Mr. Sprott's children told them\n",
      "REGULAR every day, and cross their hearts too. I s'pose Paul Irving\n",

      "him properly and I presume you couldn't expect a six-year-old child to\n",

      "he doesn't know ANYTHING right and begin at the beginning. But he'll\n",
      "have to be punished for shutting Dora up, and I can't think of any way\n",

      "\n",
      "In the end Davy was sent to bed, as usual, there to remain until noon\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I don't mean your being sent to bed. I mean the fact that you told a\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You'll laugh when you hear this,\" assured Anne. And Marilla did laugh,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I suppose I shouldn't have told him that, although I heard a minister\n",

      "\n",

      "just where the mossy old log bridge spanned the brook below the Haunted\n",
      "Wood, and they sat down by the margin of the Dryad's Bubble, where tiny\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Your birthday? But your birthday was in March!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That wasn't my fault,\" laughed Anne. \"If my parents had consulted me\n",
      "it would never have happened then. I should have chosen to be born in\n",
      "spring, of course. It must be delightful to come into the world with the\n",
      "mayflowers and violets. You would always feel that you were their foster\n",
      "sister. But since I didn't, the next best thing is to celebrate my\n",
      "birthday in the spring. Priscilla is coming over Saturday and Jane will\n",
      "be home. We'll all four start off to the woods and spend a golden day\n",
      "making the acquaintance of the spring. We none of us really know her\n",
      "yet, but we'll meet her back there as we never can anywhere else. I\n",
      "want to explore all those fields and lonely places anyhow. I have a\n",
      "conviction that there are scores of beautiful nooks there that have\n",
      "never really been SEEN although they may have been LOOKED at. We'll\n",
      "make friends with wind and sky and sun, and bring home the spring in our\n",
      "hearts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It SOUNDS awfully nice,\" said Diana, with some inward distrust of\n",
      "Anne's magic of words. \"But won't it be very damp in some places yet?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, we'll wear rubbers,\" was Anne's concession to practicalities.\n",
      "\"And I want you to come over early Saturday morning and help me prepare\n",
      "lunch. I'm going to have the daintiest things possible . . .  things that\n",
      "will match the spring, you understand . . . little jelly tarts and lady\n",
      "fingers, and drop cookies frosted with pink and yellow icing, and\n",

      "poetical.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Saturday proved an ideal day for a picnic . . . a day of breeze and blue,\n",
      "warm, sunny, with a little rollicking wind blowing across meadow\n",

      "flower-starred green.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Harrison, harrowing at the back of his farm and feeling some of the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It's so easy to be happy on a day like this, isn't it?\" Anne was\n",
      "saying, with true Anneish philosophy. \"Let's try to make this a really\n",

      "We're to seek for beauty and refuse to see anything else. 'Begone, dull\n",

      "But put it out of your mind, there's a dear. It will keep till Monday\n",
      ". . . or if it doesn't so much the better. Oh, girls, girls, see that patch\n",
      "of violets! There's something for memory's picture gallery. When I'm\n",
      "eighty years old . . . if I ever am . . . I shall shut my eyes and see\n",
      "those violets just as I see them now. That's the first good gift our day\n",
      "has given us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If a kiss could be seen I think it would look like a violet,\" said\n",
      "Priscilla.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne glowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm so glad you SPOKE that thought, Priscilla, instead of just\n",
      "thinking it and keeping it to yourself. This world would be a much more\n",
      "interesting place . . . although it IS very interesting anyhow . . .  if\n",
      "people spoke out their real thoughts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It would be too hot to hold some folks,\" quoted Jane sagely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose it might be, but that would be their own faults for thinking\n",
      "nasty things. Anyhow, we can tell all our thoughts today because we are\n",
      "going to have nothing but beautiful thoughts. Everybody can say just\n",
      "what comes into her head. THAT is conversation. Here's a little path I\n",
      "never saw before. Let's explore it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The path was a winding one, so narrow that the girls walked in single\n",
      "file and even then the fir boughs brushed their faces. Under the firs\n",
      "were velvety cushions of moss, and further on, where the trees were\n",
      "smaller and fewer, the ground was rich in a variety of green growing\n",
      "things.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a lot of elephant's ears,\" exclaimed Diana. \"I'm going to pick a\n",
      "big bunch, they're so pretty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How did such graceful feathery things ever come to have such a dreadful\n",
      "name?\" asked Priscilla.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because the person who first named them either had no imagination at\n",
      "all or else far too much,\" said Anne, \"Oh, girls, look at that!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That\" was a shallow woodland pool in the center of a little open glade\n",
      "where the path ended. Later on in the season it would be dried up\n",
      "and its place filled with a rank growth of ferns; but now it was a\n",
      "glimmering placid sheet, round as a saucer and clear as crystal. A\n",
      "ring of slender young birches encircled it and little ferns fringed its\n",
      "margin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"HOW sweet!\" said Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let us dance around it like wood-nymphs,\" cried Anne, dropping her\n",
      "basket and extending her hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the dance was not a success for the ground was boggy and Jane's\n",
      "rubbers came off.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can't be a wood-nymph if you have to wear rubbers,\" was her\n",
      "decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, we must name this place before we leave it,\" said Anne, yielding\n",
      "to the indisputable logic of facts. \"Everybody suggest a name and we'll\n",
      "draw lots. Diana?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Birch Pool,\" suggested Diana promptly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Crystal Lake,\" said Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne, standing behind them, implored Priscilla with her eyes not to\n",
      "perpetrate another such name and Priscilla rose to the occasion with\n",
      "\"Glimmer-glass.\" Anne's selection was \"The Fairies' Mirror.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The names were written on strips of birch bark with a pencil Schoolma'am\n",
      "Jane produced from her pocket, and placed in Anne's hat. Then Priscilla\n",
      "shut her eyes and drew one. \"Crystal Lake,\" read Jane triumphantly.\n",
      "Crystal Lake it was, and if Anne thought that chance had played the pool\n",
      "a shabby trick she did not say so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pushing through the undergrowth beyond, the girls came out to the young\n",
      "green seclusion of Mr. Silas Sloane's back pasture. Across it they\n",
      "found the entrance to a lane striking up through the woods and voted\n",
      "to explore it also. It rewarded their quest with a succession of pretty\n",
      "surprises. First, skirting Mr. Sloane's pasture, came an archway of wild\n",
      "cherry trees all in bloom. The girls swung their hats on their arms\n",
      "and wreathed their hair with the creamy, fluffy blossoms. Then the lane\n",
      "turned at right angles and plunged into a spruce wood so thick and dark\n",
      "that they walked in a gloom as of twilight, with not a glimpse of sky or\n",
      "sunlight to be seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is where the bad wood elves dwell,\" whispered Anne. \"They are\n",
      "impish and malicious but they can't harm us, because they are not\n",
      "allowed to do evil in the spring. There was one peeping at us around\n",
      "that old twisted fir; and didn't you see a group of them on that big\n",
      "freckly toadstool we just passed? The good fairies always dwell in the\n",
      "sunshiny places.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish there really were fairies,\" said Jane. \"Wouldn't it be nice to\n",
      "have three wishes granted you . . . or even only one? What would you wish\n",
      "for, girls, if you could have a wish granted? I'd wish to be rich and\n",
      "beautiful and clever.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'd wish to be tall and slender,\" said Diana.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would wish to be famous,\" said Priscilla. Anne thought of her hair\n",
      "and then dismissed the thought as unworthy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'd wish it might be spring all the time and in everybody's heart and\n",
      "all our lives,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But that,\" said Priscilla, \"would be just wishing this world were like\n",
      "heaven.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Only like a part of heaven. In the other parts there would be summer\n",
      "and autumn . . . yes, and a bit of winter, too. I think I want glittering\n",
      "snowy fields and white frosts in heaven sometimes. Don't you, Jane?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I . . . I don't know,\" said Jane uncomfortably. Jane was a good girl,\n",
      "a member of the church, who tried conscientiously to live up to her\n",
      "profession and believed everything she had been taught. But she never\n",
      "thought about heaven any more than she could help, for all that.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Minnie May asked me the other day if we would wear our best dresses\n",
      "every day in heaven,\" laughed Diana.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And didn't you tell her we would?\" asked Anne.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mercy, no! I told her we wouldn't be thinking of dresses at all there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I think we will . . . a LITTLE,\" said Anne earnestly. \"There'll be\n",
      "plenty of time in all eternity for it without neglecting more important\n",
      "things. I believe we'll all wear beautiful dresses . . . or I suppose\n",
      "RAIMENT would be a more suitable way of speaking. I shall want to wear\n",
      "pink for a few centuries at first . . . it would take me that long to get\n",
      "tired of it, I feel sure. I do love pink so and I can never wear it in\n",
      "THIS world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Past the spruces the lane dipped down into a sunny little open where\n",
      "a log bridge spanned a brook; and then came the glory of a sunlit\n",
      "beechwood where the air was like transparent golden wine, and the leaves\n",
      "fresh and green, and the wood floor a mosaic of tremulous sunshine. Then\n",
      "more wild cherries, and a little valley of lissome firs, and then a hill\n",
      "so steep that the girls lost their breath climbing it; but when they\n",
      "reached the top and came out into the open the prettiest surprise of all\n",
      "awaited them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond were the \"back fields\" of the farms that ran out to the upper\n",
      "Carmody road. Just before them, hemmed in by beeches and firs but open\n",
      "to the south, was a little corner and in it a garden  . . . or what had\n",
      "once been a garden. A tumbledown stone dyke, overgrown with mosses and\n",
      "grass, surrounded it. Along the eastern side ran a row of garden cherry\n",
      "trees, white as a snowdrift. There were traces of old paths still and\n",
      "a double line of rosebushes through the middle; but all the rest of the\n",
      "space was a sheet of yellow and white narcissi, in their airiest, most\n",
      "lavish, wind-swayed bloom above the lush green grasses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, how perfectly lovely!\" three of the girls cried. Anne only gazed in\n",
      "eloquent silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How in the world does it happen that there ever was a garden back\n",
      "here?\" said Priscilla in amazement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It must be Hester Gray's garden,\" said Diana. \"I've heard mother speak\n",
      "of it but I never saw it before, and I wouldn't have supposed that it\n",
      "could be in existence still. You've heard the story, Anne?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, but the name seems familiar to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, you've seen it in the graveyard. She is buried down there in the\n",
      "poplar corner. You know the little brown stone with the opening gates\n",
      "carved on it and 'Sacred to the memory of Hester Gray, aged twenty-two.'\n",
      "Jordan Gray is buried right beside her but there's no stone to him. It's\n",
      "a wonder Marilla never told you about it, Anne. To be sure, it happened\n",
      "thirty years ago and everybody has forgotten.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, if there's a story we must have it,\" said Anne. \"Let's sit right\n",
      "down here among the narcissi and Diana will tell it. Why, girls, there\n",
      "are hundreds of them . . . they've spread over everything. It looks as if\n",
      "the garden were carpeted with moonshine and sunshine combined. This is\n",
      "a discovery worth making. To think that I've lived within a mile of this\n",
      "place for six years and have never seen it before! Now, Diana.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Long ago,\" began Diana, \"this farm belonged to old Mr. David Gray. He\n",
      "didn't live on it . . . he lived where Silas Sloane lives now. He had one\n",
      "son, Jordan, and he went up to Boston one winter to work and while\n",
      "he was there he fell in love with a girl named Hester Murray. She\n",
      "was working in a store and she hated it. She'd been brought up in the\n",
      "country and she always wanted to get back. When Jordan asked her to\n",
      "marry him she said she would if he'd take her away to some quiet spot\n",
      "where she'd see nothing but fields and trees. So he brought her to\n",
      "Avonlea. Mrs. Lynde said he was taking a fearful risk in marrying a\n",
      "Yankee, and it's certain that Hester was very delicate and a very poor\n",
      "housekeeper; but mother says she was very pretty and sweet and Jordan\n",
      "just worshipped the ground she walked on. Well, Mr. Gray gave Jordan\n",
      "this farm and he built a little house back here and Jordan and Hester\n",
      "lived in it for four years. She never went out much and hardly anybody\n",
      "went to see her except mother and Mrs. Lynde. Jordan made her this\n",
      "garden and she was crazy about it and spent most of her time in it. She\n",
      "wasn't much of a housekeeper but she had a knack with flowers. And then\n",
      "she got sick. Mother says she thinks she was in consumption before she\n",
      "ever came here. She never really laid up but just grew weaker and weaker\n",
      "all the time. Jordan wouldn't have anybody to wait on her. He did it all\n",
      "himself and mother says he was as tender and gentle as a woman. Every\n",
      "day he'd wrap her in a shawl and carry her out to the garden and she'd\n",
      "lie there on a bench quite happy. They say she used to make Jordan kneel\n",
      "down by her every night and morning and pray with her that she might die\n",
      "out in the garden when the time came. And her prayer was answered. One\n",
      "day Jordan carried her out to the bench and then he picked all the roses\n",
      "that were out and heaped them over her; and she just smiled up at him\n",
      ". . . and closed her eyes . . . and that,\" concluded Diana softly, \"was\n",
      "the end.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, what a dear story,\" sighed Anne, wiping away her tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What became of Jordan?\" asked Priscilla.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He sold the farm after Hester died and went back to Boston. Mr. Jabez\n",
      "Sloane bought the farm and hauled the little house out to the road.\n",
      "Jordan died about ten years after and he was brought home and buried\n",
      "beside Hester.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't understand how she could have wanted to live back here, away\n",
      "from everything,\" said Jane.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I can easily understand THAT,\" said Anne thoughtfully. \"I wouldn't\n",
      "want it myself for a steady thing, because, although I love the fields\n",
      "and woods, I love people too. But I can understand it in Hester. She\n",
      "was tired to death of the noise of the big city and the crowds of people\n",
      "always coming and going and caring nothing for her. She just wanted to\n",
      "escape from it all to some still, green, friendly place where she could\n",
      "rest. And she got just what she wanted, which is something very few\n",
      "people do, I believe. She had four beautiful years before she died. . .\n",
      "four years of perfect happiness, so I think she was to be envied more\n",
      "than pitied. And then to shut your eyes and fall asleep among roses,\n",
      "with the one you loved best on earth smiling down at you . . . oh, I think\n",
      "it was beautiful!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She set out those cherry trees over there,\" said Diana. \"She told\n",
      "mother she'd never live to eat their fruit, but she wanted to think that\n",
      "something she had planted would go on living and helping to make the\n",
      "world beautiful after she was dead.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm so glad we came this way,\" said Anne, the shining-eyed. \"This is\n",
      "my adopted birthday, you know, and this garden and its story is the\n",
      "birthday gift it has given me. Did your mother ever tell you what Hester\n",
      "Gray looked like, Diana?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No . . . only just that she was pretty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm rather glad of that, because I can imagine what she looked like,\n",
      "without being hampered by facts. I think she was very slight and small,\n",
      "with softly curling dark hair and big, sweet, timid brown eyes, and a\n",
      "little wistful, pale face.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The girls left their baskets in Hester's garden and spent the rest\n",
      "of the afternoon rambling in the woods and fields surrounding it,\n",
      "discovering many pretty nooks and lanes. When they got hungry they had\n",
      "lunch in the prettiest spot of all . . . on the steep bank of a gurgling\n",
      "brook where white birches shot up out of long feathery grasses. The\n",
      "girls sat down by the roots and did full justice to Anne's dainties,\n",
      "even the unpoetical sandwiches being greatly appreciated by hearty,\n",
      "unspoiled appetites sharpened by all the fresh air and exercise they had\n",
      "enjoyed. Anne had brought glasses and lemonade for her guests, but for\n",
      "her own part drank cold brook water from a cup fashioned out of birch\n",
      "bark. The cup leaked, and the water tasted of earth, as brook water\n",
      "is apt to do in spring; but Anne thought it more appropriate to the\n",
      "occasion than lemonade.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look do you see that poem?\" she said suddenly, pointing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where?\" Jane and Diana stared, as if expecting to see Runic rhymes on\n",
      "the birch trees.\n",
      "\n",

      "water flowing over it in those smooth ripples that look as if they'd\n",

      "sifted sunlight streaming through a birch tree. \"Only with shape and\n",
      "features of course. I like to fancy souls as being made of light. And\n",
      "some are all shot through with rosy stains and quivers . . . and some\n",

      "filled with narcissus blossoms from Hester's garden, some of which Anne\n",
      "carried to the cemetery next day and laid upon Hester's grave. Minstrel\n",

      "Marilla, it is needless to say, was bringing the twins up in the\n",
      "good old ways of theology and discouraged all fanciful speculations\n",
      "thereupon. Davy and Dora were taught a hymn, a catechism question, and\n",
      "two Bible verses every Sunday. Dora learned meekly and recited like a\n",
      "little machine, with perhaps as much understanding or interest as if she\n",

      "accomplished wonders. Early in the spring Mr. Major Spencer had redeemed\n",

      "The Improvers DID know, all too well. Even the least imaginative among\n",

      "adorned with such advertisements. All thought of church and school\n",
      "grounds vanished before this new danger. Parliamentary rules and\n",

      "\n",
      "The prospect looked rather unpromising. Judson Parker and his sister\n",
      "were the only Parkers in Avonlea, so that no leverage could be exerted\n",
      "by family connections. Martha Parker was a lady of all too certain\n",
      "age who disapproved of young people in general and the Improvers\n",
      "in particular. Judson was a jovial, smooth-spoken man, so uniformly\n",
      "goodnatured and bland that it was surprising how few friends he had.\n",
      "Perhaps he had got the better in too many business transactions. . .\n",
      "which seldom makes for popularity. He was reputed to be very \"sharp\"\n",

      "appointed to support her morally and the Improvers broke up, buzzing\n",
      "like angry bees with indignation. Anne was so worried that she didn't\n",

      "and defied it, and the Improvers were trying to reconcile themselves to\n",
      "the prospect of seeing the prettiest part of the Newbridge road defaced\n",
      "by advertisements, when Anne rose quietly at the president's call\n",
      "for reports of committees on the occasion of the next meeting of the\n",

      "Jane and Diana stared as if they found it hard to believe their ears.\n",
      "Parliamentary etiquette, which was generally very strictly enforced in\n",
      "the A.V.I.S., forbade them giving instant vent to their curiosity, but\n",
      "after the Society adjourned Anne was besieged for explanations. Anne had\n",
      "no explanation to give. Judson Parker had overtaken her on the road the\n",
      "preceding evening and told her that he had decided to humor the A.V.I.S.\n",
      "in its peculiar prejudice against patent medicine advertisements. That\n",
      "was all Anne would say, then or ever afterwards, and it was the simple\n",
      "truth; but when Jane Andrews, on her way home, confided to Oliver Sloane\n",
      "her firm belief that there was more behind Judson Parker's mysterious\n",
      "change of heart than Anne Shirley had revealed, she spoke the truth\n",
      "also.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne had been down to old Mrs. Irving's on the shore road the preceding\n",
      "evening and had come home by a short cut which led her first over the\n",
      "low-lying shore fields, and then through the beech wood below Robert\n",
      "Dickson's, by a little footpath that ran out to the main road just above\n",
      "the Lake of Shining Waters . . . known to unimaginative people as Barry's\n",
      "pond.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two men were sitting in their buggies, reined off to the side of the\n",
      "road, just at the entrance of the path. One was Judson Parker; the other\n",
      "was Jerry Corcoran, a Newbridge man against whom, as Mrs. Lynde would\n",
      "have told you in eloquent italics, nothing shady had ever been PROVED.\n",
      "He was an agent for agricultural implements and a prominent personage\n",
      "in matters political. He had a finger . . .  some people said ALL his\n",
      "fingers . . . in every political pie that was cooked; and as Canada was\n",
      "on the eve of a general election Jerry Corcoran had been a busy man\n",
      "for many weeks, canvassing the county in the interests of his party's\n",
      "candidate. Just as Anne emerged from under the overhanging beech boughs\n",
      "she heard Corcoran say, \"If you'll vote for Amesbury, Parker . . . well,\n",
      "I've a note for that pair of harrows you've got in the spring. I suppose\n",
      "you wouldn't object to having it back, eh?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We . . . ll, since you put it in that way,\" drawled Judson with a\n",
      "grin, \"I reckon I might as well do it. A man must look out for his own\n",
      "interests in these hard times.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Both saw Anne at this moment and conversation abruptly ceased. Anne\n",
      "bowed frostily and walked on, with her chin slightly more tilted than\n",
      "usual. Soon Judson Parker overtook her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Have a lift, Anne?\" he inquired genially.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you, no,\" said Anne politely, but with a fine, needle-like\n",
      "disdain in her voice that pierced even Judson Parker's none too\n",
      "sensitive consciousness. His face reddened and he twitched his reins\n",
      "angrily; but the next second prudential considerations checked him. He\n",
      "looked uneasily at Anne, as she walked steadily on, glancing neither to\n",
      "the right nor to the left. Had she heard Corcoran's unmistakable\n",
      "offer and his own too plain acceptance of it? Confound Corcoran! If\n",
      "he couldn't put his meaning into less dangerous phrases he'd get\n",
      "into trouble some of these long-come-shorts. And confound redheaded\n",
      "school-ma'ams with a habit of popping out of beechwoods where they had\n",
      "no business to be. If Anne had heard, Judson Parker, measuring her corn\n",
      "in his own half bushel, as the country saying went, and cheating himself\n",
      "thereby, as such people generally do, believed that she would tell\n",
      "it far and wide. Now, Judson Parker, as has been seen, was not overly\n",
      "regardful of public opinion; but to be known as having accepted a bribe\n",
      "would be a nasty thing; and if it ever reached Isaac Spencer's ears\n",
      "farewell forever to all hope of winning Louisa Jane with her comfortable\n",
      "prospects as the heiress of a well-to-do farmer. Judson Parker knew\n",
      "that Mr. Spencer looked somewhat askance at him as it was; he could not\n",
      "afford to take any risks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ahem . . . Anne, I've been wanting to see you about that little matter we\n",
      "were discussing the other day. I've decided not to let my fences to\n",
      "that company after all. A society with an aim like yours ought to be\n",
      "encouraged.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne thawed out the merest trifle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thank you,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And . . . and . . . you needn't mention that little conversation of mine\n",
      "with Jerry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have no intention of mentioning it in any case,\" said Anne icily, for\n",
      "she would have seen every fence in Avonlea painted with advertisements\n",
      "before she would have stooped to bargain with a man who would sell his\n",
      "vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just so . . . just so,\" agreed Judson, imagining that they understood\n",
      "each other beautifully. \"I didn't suppose you would. Of course, I was\n",
      "only stringing Jerry . . . he thinks he's so all-fired cute and smart.\n",
      "I've no intention of voting for Amesbury. I'm going to vote for Grant as\n",
      "I've always done . . . you'll see that when the election comes off. I just\n",
      "led Jerry on to see if he would commit himself. And it's all right about\n",
      "the fence  . . . you can tell the Improvers that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It takes all sorts of people to make a world, as I've often heard, but\n",
      "I think there are some who could be spared,\" Anne told her reflection\n",
      "in the east gable mirror that night. \"I wouldn't have mentioned the\n",
      "disgraceful thing to a soul anyhow, so my conscience is clear on THAT\n",
      "score. I really don't know who or what is to be thanked for this. _I_\n",
      "did nothing to bring it about, and it's hard to believe that Providence\n",

      "\n",
      "Anne locked the schoolhouse door on a still, yellow evening, when the\n",
      "winds were purring in the spruces around the playground, and the shadows\n",
      "were long and lazy by the edge of the woods. She dropped the key into\n",
      "her pocket with a sigh of satisfaction. The school year was ended, she\n",
      "had been reengaged for the next, with many expressions of satisfaction.\n",
      ". . . only Mr. Harmon Andrews told her she ought to use the strap\n",
      "oftener . . . and two delightful months of a well-earned vacation\n",
      "beckoned her invitingly. Anne felt at peace with the world and herself\n",
      "as she walked down the hill with her basket of flowers in her hand.\n",
      "Since the earliest mayflowers Anne had never missed her weekly\n",
      "pilgrimage to Matthew's grave. Everyone else in Avonlea, except Marilla,\n",
      "had already forgotten quiet, shy, unimportant Matthew Cuthbert; but his\n",
      "memory was still green in Anne's heart and always would be. She could\n",
      "never forget the kind old man who had been the first to give her the\n",
      "love and sympathy her starved childhood had craved.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the foot of the hill a boy was sitting on the fence in the shadow of\n",
      "the spruces . . . a boy with big, dreamy eyes and a beautiful, sensitive\n",
      "face. He swung down and joined Anne, smiling; but there were traces of\n",
      "tears on his cheeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought I'd wait for you, teacher, because I knew you were going to\n",
      "the graveyard,\" he said, slipping his hand into hers. \"I'm going there,\n",
      "too . . . I'm taking this bouquet of geraniums to put on Grandpa Irving's\n",
      "grave for grandma. And look, teacher, I'm going to put this bunch of\n",
      "white roses beside Grandpa's grave in memory of my little mother. . .\n",
      "because I can't go to her grave to put it there. But don't you think\n",

      "\"Yes, I am sure she will, Paul.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You see, teacher, it's just three years today since my little mother\n",
      "died. It's such a long, long time but it hurts just as much as ever\n",
      ". . . and I miss her just as much as ever. Sometimes it seems to me\n",
      "that I just can't bear it, it hurts so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul's voice quivered and his lip trembled. He looked down at his roses,\n",
      "hoping that his teacher would not notice the tears in his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And yet,\" said Anne, very softly, \"you wouldn't want it to stop hurting\n",
      " . . . you wouldn't want to forget your little mother even if you could.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed, I wouldn't . . . that's just the way I feel. You're so good\n",
      "at understanding, teacher. Nobody else understands so well . . . not even\n",
      "grandma, although she's so good to me. Father understood pretty well,\n",
      "but still I couldn't talk much to him about mother, because it made him\n",
      "feel so bad. When he put his hand over his face I always knew it was\n",
      "time to stop. Poor father, he must be dreadfully lonesome without\n",
      "me; but you see he has nobody but a housekeeper now and he thinks\n",
      "housekeepers are no good to bring up little boys, especially when he has\n",
      "to be away from home so much on business. Grandmothers are better, next\n",
      "to mothers. Someday, when I'm brought up, I'll go back to father and\n",

      "\n",
      "Paul had talked so much to Anne about his mother and father that she\n",
      "felt as if she had known them. She thought his mother must have been\n",
      "very like what he was himself, in temperament and disposition; and she\n",
      "had an idea that Stephen Irving was a rather reserved man with a deep\n",
      "and tender nature which he kept hidden scrupulously from the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Father's not very easy to get acquainted with,\" Paul had said once. \"I\n",

      "But he's splendid when you do get to know him. I love him the best in\n",
      "all the world, and Grandma Irving next, and then you, teacher. I'd love\n",
      "you next to father if it wasn't my DUTY to love Grandma Irving best,\n",
      "because she's doing so much for me. YOU know, teacher. I wish she would\n",
      "leave the lamp in my room till I go to sleep, though. She takes it right\n",
      "out as soon as she tucks me up because she says I mustn't be a coward.\n",
      "I'm NOT scared, but I'd RATHER have the light. My little mother used\n",
      "always to sit beside me and hold my hand till I went to sleep. I expect\n",
      "she spoiled me. Mothers do sometimes, you know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "No, Anne did not know this, although she might imagine it. She thought\n",
      "sadly of HER \"little mother,\" the mother who had thought her so\n",
      "\"perfectly beautiful\" and who had died so long ago and was buried beside\n",
      "her boyish husband in that unvisited grave far away. Anne could not\n",
      "remember her mother and for this reason she almost envied Paul.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My birthday is next week,\" said Paul, as they walked up the long red\n",
      "hill, basking in the June sunshine, \"and father wrote me that he is\n",
      "sending me something that he thinks I'll like better than anything else\n",
      "he could send. I believe it has come already, for Grandma is keeping the\n",
      "bookcase drawer locked and that is something new. And when I asked her\n",
      "why, she just looked mysterious and said little boys mustn't be too\n",
      "curious. It's very exciting to have a birthday, isn't it? I'll be\n",
      "eleven. You'd never think it to look at me, would you? Grandma says\n",
      "I'm very small for my age and that it's all because I don't eat enough\n",
      "porridge. I do my very best, but Grandma gives such generous platefuls\n",
      ". . . there's nothing mean about Grandma, I can tell you. Ever since you\n",
      "and I had that talk about praying going home from Sunday School\n",
      "that day, teacher . . .  when you said we ought to pray about all our\n",
      "difficulties . . . I've prayed every night that God would give me enough\n",
      "grace to enable me to eat every bit of my porridge in the mornings. But\n",
      "I've never been able to do it yet, and whether it's because I have too\n",
      "little grace or too much porridge I really can't decide. Grandma says\n",
      "father was brought up on porridge, and it certainly did work well in\n",
      "his case, for you ought to see the shoulders he has. But sometimes,\"\n",
      "concluded Paul with a sigh and a meditative air \"I really think porridge\n",
      "will be the death of me.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"He HAS to,\" said Paul emphatically. \"He knows I won't associate with\n",

      "\"And has Nora found out about the Golden Lady yet?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; but I think she suspects. I'm almost sure she watched me the last\n",

      "for HER sake I don't want her to . . . so that her feelings won't be hurt.\n",
      "But if she is DETERMINED to have her feelings hurt it can't be helped.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No, I don't think you could see MY rock people. I'm the only person who\n",

      "the kind that can. We're both that kind. YOU know, teacher,\" he added,\n",
      "squeezing her hand chummily. \"Isn't it splendid to be that kind,\n",
      "teacher?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Splendid,\" Anne agreed, gray shining eyes looking down into blue\n",

      "     \"How fair the realm\n",
      "     Imagination opens to the view,\"\n",

      "immortal by dale and stream; clouds never darkened the sunny sky; sweet\n",
      "bells never jangled out of tune; and kindred spirits abounded. The\n",
      "knowledge of that land's geography . . .  \"east o' the sun, west o' the\n",
      "moon\" . . . is priceless lore, not to be bought in any market place. It\n",
      "must be the gift of the good fairies at birth and the years can never\n",

      "At some future time the Improvers meant to have the lichened, wayward\n",

      "are broad or narrow according to what we put into them, not what we get\n",
      "out. Life is rich and full here . . .  everywhere . . . if we can only\n",

      "and Paul Irving, and the dear twins, and all my friends. Do you know,\n",
      "Mrs. Allan, I'm so thankful for friendship. It beautifies life so much.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"True friendship is a very helpful thing indeed,\" said Mrs. Allan,\n",
      "\"and we should have a very high ideal of it, and never sully it by any\n",
      "failure in truth and sincerity. I fear the name of friendship is often\n",
      "degraded to a kind of intimacy that has nothing of real friendship in\n",
      "it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes . . . like Gertie Pye's and Julia Bell's. They are very intimate\n",
      "and go everywhere together; but Gertie is always saying nasty things of\n",
      "Julia behind her back and everybody thinks she is jealous of her because\n",
      "she is always so pleased when anybody criticizes Julia. I think it is\n",
      "desecration to call that friendship. If we have friends we should look\n",
      "only for the best in them and give them the best that is in us, don't\n",
      "you think? Then friendship would be the most beautiful thing in the\n",
      "world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Friendship IS very beautiful,\" smiled Mrs. Allan, \"but some day . . .\"\n",

      "Then she paused abruptly. In the delicate, white-browed face beside her,\n",
      "with its candid eyes and mobile features, there was still far more of\n",
      "the child than of the woman. Anne's heart so far harbored only dreams of\n",
      "friendship and ambition, and Mrs. Allan did not wish to brush the bloom\n",
      "from her sweet unconsciousness. So she left her sentence for the future\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I'll get you a piece of bread and butter in a minute,\" said Anne\n",
      "absently. Her letter evidently contained some exciting news, for her\n",
      "cheeks were as pink as the roses on the big bush outside, and her eyes\n",
      "were as starry as only Anne's eyes could be.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I ain't bread and butter hungry,\" said Davy in a disgusted tone.\n",

      "Davy to give him a squeeze, \"that's a kind of hunger that can be endured\n",
      "very comfortably, Davy-boy. You know it's one of Marilla's rules that\n",
      "you can't have anything but bread and butter between meals.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, gimme a piece then . . . please.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Davy had been at last taught to say \"please,\" but he generally tacked\n",
      "it on as an afterthought. He looked with approval at the generous slice\n",
      "Anne presently brought to him. \"You always put such a nice lot of butter\n",
      "on it, Anne. Marilla spreads it pretty thin. It slips down a lot easier\n",
      "when there's plenty of butter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The slice \"slipped down\" with tolerable ease, judging from its rapid\n",
      "disappearance. Davy slid head first off the sofa, turned a double\n",
      "somersault on the rug, and then sat up and announced decidedly,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anne, I've made up my mind about heaven. I don't want to go there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why not?\" asked Anne gravely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Cause heaven is in Simon Fletcher's garret, and I don't like Simon\n",
      "Fletcher.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heaven in . . . Simon Fletcher's garret!\" gasped Anne, too amazed even\n",
      "to laugh. \"Davy Keith, whatever put such an extraordinary idea into your\n",
      "head?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Milty Boulter says that's where it is. It was last Sunday in Sunday\n",
      "School. The lesson was about Elijah and Elisha, and I up and asked Miss\n",

      "cross anyhow, because when she'd asked us what Elijah left Elisha when\n",
      "he went to heaven Milty Boulter said, 'His old clo'es,' and us fellows\n",
      "all laughed before we thought. I wish you could think first and do\n",
      "things afterwards, 'cause then you wouldn't do them. But Milty didn't\n",
      "mean to be disrespeckful. He just couldn't think of the name of the\n",
      "thing. Miss Rogerson said heaven was where God was and I wasn't to ask\n",
      "questions like that. Milty nudged me and said in a whisper, 'Heaven's\n",
      "in Uncle Simon's garret and I'll esplain about it on the road home.' So\n",
      "when we was coming home he esplained. Milty's a great hand at esplaining\n",
      "things. Even if he don't know anything about a thing he'll make up a lot\n",
      "of stuff and so you get it esplained all the same. His mother is Mrs.\n",
      "Simon's sister and he went with her to the funeral when his cousin, Jane\n",
      "Ellen, died. The minister said she'd gone to heaven, though Milty says\n",

      "carried the coffin to the garret afterwards. Well, when Milty and his\n",
      "mother went upstairs after it was all over to get her bonnet he asked\n",
      "her where heaven was that Jane Ellen had gone to, and she pointed right\n",

      "Anne took Davy on her knee and did her best to straighten out this\n",
      "theological tangle also. She was much better fitted for the task than\n",
      "Marilla, for she remembered her own childhood and had an instinctive\n",
      "understanding of the curious ideas that seven-year-olds sometimes get\n",
      "about matters that are, of course, very plain and simple to grown up\n",
      "people. She had just succeeded in convincing Davy that heaven was NOT in\n",
      "Simon Fletcher's garret when Marilla came in from the garden, where she\n",
      "and Dora had been picking peas. Dora was an industrious little soul and\n",
      "never happier than when \"helping\" in various small tasks suited to her\n",
      "chubby fingers. She fed chickens, picked up chips, wiped dishes, and ran\n",
      "errands galore. She was neat, faithful and observant; she never had\n",
      "to be told how to do a thing twice and never forgot any of her little\n",
      "duties. Davy, on the other hand, was rather heedless and forgetful; but\n",
      "he had the born knack of winning love, and even yet Anne and Marilla\n",
      "liked him the better.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Dora proudly shelled the peas and Davy made boats of the pods,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Marilla, what do you think? I've had a letter from Priscilla and\n",
      "she says that Mrs. Morgan is on the Island, and that if it is fine\n",
      "Thursday they are going to drive up to Avonlea and will reach here about\n",
      "twelve. They will spend the afternoon with us and go to the hotel at\n",
      "White Sands in the evening, because some of Mrs. Morgan's American\n",
      "friends are staying there. Oh, Marilla, isn't it wonderful? I can hardly\n",
      "believe I'm not dreaming.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I daresay Mrs. Morgan is a lot like other people,\" said Marilla drily,\n",
      "although she did feel a trifle excited herself. Mrs. Morgan was a famous\n",
      "woman and a visit from her was no commonplace occurrence. \"They'll be\n",
      "here to dinner, then?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; and oh, Marilla, may I cook every bit of the dinner myself? I want\n",
      "to feel that I can do something for the author of 'The Rosebud Garden,'\n",
      "if it is only to cook a dinner for her. You won't mind, will you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Goodness, I'm not so fond of stewing over a hot fire in July that it\n",

      "to the job.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, thank you,\" said Anne, as if Marilla had just conferred a\n",
      "tremendous favor, \"I'll make out the menu this very night.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'd better not try to put on too much style,\" warned Marilla, a\n",
      "little alarmed by the high-flown sound of 'menu.' \"You'll likely come to\n",
      "grief if you do.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I'm not going to put on any 'style,' if you mean trying to do or\n",
      "have things we don't usually have on festal occasions,\" assured Anne.\n",
      "\"That would be affectation, and, although I know I haven't as much sense\n",
      "and steadiness as a girl of seventeen and a schoolteacher ought to have,\n",
      "I'm not so silly as THAT. But I want to have everything as nice and\n",
      "dainty as possible. Davy-boy, don't leave those peapods on the back\n",
      "stairs . . . someone might slip on them. I'll have a light soup to begin\n",
      "with . . . you know I can make lovely cream-of-onion soup . . . and then\n",
      "a couple of roast fowls. I'll have the two white roosters. I have real\n",
      "affection for those roosters and they've been pets ever since the gray\n",
      "hen hatched out just the two of them . . . little balls of yellow down.\n",
      "But I know they would have to be sacrificed sometime, and surely there\n",
      "couldn't be a worthier occasion than this. But oh, Marilla, _I_ cannot\n",
      "kill them . . . not even for Mrs. Morgan's sake. I'll have to ask John\n",
      "Henry Carter to come over and do it for me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll do it,\" volunteered Davy, \"if Marilla'll hold them by the legs,\n",
      "'cause I guess it'd take both my hands to manage the axe. It's awful\n",
      "jolly fun to see them hopping about after their heads are cut off.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I'll have peas and beans and creamed potatoes and a lettuce salad,\n",
      "for vegetables,\" resumed Anne, \"and for dessert, lemon pie with whipped\n",
      "cream, and coffee and cheese and lady fingers. I'll make the pies and\n",
      "lady fingers tomorrow and do up my white muslin dress. And I must tell\n",
      "Diana tonight, for she'll want to do up hers. Mrs. Morgan's heroines\n",
      "are nearly always dressed in white muslin, and Diana and I have always\n",
      "resolved that that was what we would wear if we ever met her. It will\n",
      "be such a delicate compliment, don't you think? Davy, dear, you mustn't\n",
      "poke peapods into the cracks of the floor. I must ask Mr. and Mrs. Allan\n",
      "and Miss Stacy to dinner, too, for they're all very anxious to meet Mrs.\n",
      "Morgan. It's so fortunate she's coming while Miss Stacy is here. Davy\n",
      "dear, don't sail the peapods in the water bucket . . . go out to the\n",
      "trough. Oh, I do hope it will be fine Thursday, and I think it will, for\n",
      "Uncle Abe said last night when he called at Mr. Harrison's, that it was\n",
      "going to rain most of this week.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's a good sign,\" agreed Marilla.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne ran across to Orchard Slope that evening to tell the news to Diana,\n",
      "who was also very much excited over it, and they discussed the matter in\n",
      "the hammock swung under the big willow in the Barry garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Anne, mayn't I help you cook the dinner?\" implored Diana. \"You know\n",
      "I can make splendid lettuce salad.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed you, may\" said Anne unselfishly. \"And I shall want you to help\n",
      "me decorate too. I mean to have the parlor simply a BOWER of blossoms\n",
      ". . . and the dining table is to be adorned with wild roses. Oh, I do\n",
      "hope everything will go smoothly. Mrs. Morgan's heroines NEVER get\n",
      "into scrapes or are taken at a disadvantage, and they are always so\n",
      "selfpossessed and such good housekeepers. They seem to be BORN good\n",
      "housekeepers. You remember that Gertrude in 'Edgewood Days' kept house\n",
      "for her father when she was only eight years old. When I was eight\n",
      "years old I hardly knew how to do a thing except bring up children. Mrs.\n",
      "Morgan must be an authority on girls when she has written so much about\n",
      "them, and I do want her to have a good opinion of us. I've imagined\n",
      "it all out a dozen different ways . . . what she'll look like, and what\n",
      "she'll say, and what I'll say. And I'm so anxious about my nose. There\n",
      "are seven freckles on it, as you can see. They came at the A.V.I S.\n",
      "picnic, when I went around in the sun without my hat. I suppose it's\n",
      "ungrateful of me to worry over them, when I should be thankful they're\n",
      "not spread all over my face as they once were; but I do wish they hadn't\n",
      "come . . . all Mrs. Morgan's heroines have such perfect complexions. I\n",
      "can't recall a freckled one among them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yours are not very noticeable,\" comforted Diana. \"Try a little lemon\n",
      "juice on them tonight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day Anne made her pies and lady fingers, did up her muslin\n",
      "dress, and swept and dusted every room in the house . . . a quite\n",
      "unnecessary proceeding, for Green Gables was, as usual, in the apple pie\n",
      "order dear to Marilla's heart. But Anne felt that a fleck of dust would\n",
      "be a desecration in a house that was to be honored by a visit from\n",
      "Charlotte E. Morgan. She even cleaned out the \"catch-all\" closet under\n",
      "the stairs, although there was not the remotest possibility of Mrs.\n",
      "Morgan's seeing its interior.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I want to FEEL that it is in perfect order, even if she isn't to\n",
      "see it,\" Anne told Marilla. \"You know, in her book 'Golden Keys,' she\n",
      "makes her two heroines Alice and Louisa take for their motto that verse\n",
      "of Longfellow's,\n",
      "\n",
      "     'In the elder days of art\n",
      "     Builders wrought with greatest care\n",
      "     Each minute and unseen part,\n",
      "     For the gods see everywhere,'\n",
      "\n",
      "and so they always kept their cellar stairs scrubbed and never forgot\n",
      "to sweep under the beds. I should have a guilty conscience if I thought\n",
      "this closet was in disorder when Mrs. Morgan was in the house. Ever\n",
      "since we read 'Golden Keys,' last April, Diana and I have taken that\n",
      "verse for our motto too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That night John Henry Carter and Davy between them contrived to execute\n",
      "the two white roosters, and Anne dressed them, the usually distasteful\n",
      "task glorified in her eyes by the destination of the plump birds.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't like picking fowls,\" she told Marilla, \"but isn't it fortunate\n",
      "we don't have to put our souls into what our hands may be doing? I've\n",
      "been picking chickens with my hands but in imagination I've been roaming\n",
      "the Milky Way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought you'd scattered more feathers over the floor than usual,\"\n",
      "remarked Marilla.\n",

      "perfectly the next day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I'm as good as good can be all day tomorrow will you let me be just\n",
      "as bad as I like all the next day?\" asked Davy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I couldn't do that,\" said Anne discreetly, \"but I'll take you and Dora\n",
      "for a row in the flat right to the bottom of the pond, and we'll go\n",
      "ashore on the sandhills and have a picnic.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a bargain,\" said Davy. \"I'll be good, you bet. I meant to go over\n",
      "to Mr. Harrison's and fire peas from my new popgun at Ginger but another\n",

      "\n",

      "over against it. If you are slightly too plump you've got the dearest\n",

      "There may have been two happier and more excited girls somewhere in\n",
      "Canada or the United States at that moment, but I doubt it. Every snip\n",
      "of the scissors, as rose and peony and bluebell fell, seemed to chirp,\n",
      "\"Mrs. Morgan is coming today.\" Anne wondered how Mr. Harrison COULD go\n",

      "at such times as they clung to unfortunate people's buttons. Even Anne\n",
      "had never been able to infuse much grace into it, for Marilla would not\n",
      "permit any alterations. But it is wonderful what flowers can accomplish\n",
      "if you give them a fair chance; when Anne and Diana finished with the\n",
      "room you would not have recognized it.\n",
      "\n",
      "A great blue bowlful of snowballs overflowed on the polished table. The\n",

      "of the what-not held a sheaf of bluebells; the dark corners on either\n",
      "side of the grate were lighted up with jars full of glowing crimson\n",
      "peonies, and the grate itself was aflame with yellow poppies. All\n",
      "this splendor and color, mingled with the sunshine falling through the\n",
      "honeysuckle vines at the windows in a leafy riot of dancing shadows over\n",
      "walls and floor, made of the usually dismal little room the veritable\n",

      "from Marilla, who came in to criticize and remained to praise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, we must set the table,\" said Anne, in the tone of a priestess\n",
      "about to perform some sacred rite in honor of a divinity. \"We'll have a\n",

      "to glow crimson, as much with excitement as from the heat of the fire,\n",
      "prepared the bread sauce for the chickens, minced her onions for the\n",
      "soup, and finally whipped the cream for her lemon pies.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what about Davy all this time? Was he redeeming his promise to\n",
      "be good? He was, indeed. To be sure, he insisted on remaining in the\n",
      "kitchen, for his curiosity wanted to see all that went on. But as he sat\n",
      "quietly in a corner, busily engaged in untying the knots in a piece of\n",
      "herring net he had brought home from his last trip to the shore, nobody\n",
      "objected to this.\n",
      "\n",
      "At half past eleven the lettuce salad was made, the golden circles of\n",
      "the pies were heaped with whipped cream, and everything was sizzling and\n",
      "bubbling that ought to sizzle and bubble.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We'd better go and dress now,\" said Anne, \"for they may be here by\n",
      "twelve. We must have dinner at sharp one, for the soup must be served as\n",
      "soon as it's done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Serious indeed were the toilet rites presently performed in the east\n",
      "gable. Anne peered anxiously at her nose and rejoiced to see that its\n",
      "freckles were not at all prominent, thanks either to the lemon juice\n",
      "or to the unusual flush on her cheeks. When they were ready they looked\n",
      "quite as sweet and trim and girlish as ever did any of \"Mrs. Morgan's\n",
      "heroines.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do hope I'll be able to say something once in a while, and not sit\n",
      "like a mute,\" said Diana anxiously. \"All Mrs. Morgan's heroines converse\n",
      "so beautifully. But I'm afraid I'll be tongue-tied and stupid. And I'll\n",
      "be sure to say 'I seen.' I haven't often said it since Miss Stacy taught\n",
      "here; but in moments of excitement it's sure to pop out. Anne, if I\n",
      "were to say 'I seen' before Mrs. Morgan I'd die of mortification. And it\n",
      "would be almost as bad to have nothing to say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm nervous about a good many things,\" said Anne, \"but I don't think\n",
      "there is much fear that I won't be able to talk.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And, to do her justice, there wasn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne shrouded her muslin glories in a big apron and went down to concoct\n",
      "her soup. Marilla had dressed herself and the twins, and looked more\n",
      "excited than she had ever been known to look before. At half past twelve\n",
      "the Allans and Miss Stacy came. Everything was going well but Anne was\n",
      "beginning to feel nervous. It was surely time for Priscilla and Mrs.\n",
      "Morgan to arrive. She made frequent trips to the gate and looked as\n",
      "anxiously down the lane as ever her namesake in the Bluebeard story\n",
      "peered from the tower casement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Suppose they don't come at all?\" she said piteously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't suppose it. It would be too mean,\" said Diana, who, however, was\n",
      "beginning to have uncomfortable misgivings on the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anne,\" said Marilla, coming out from the parlor, \"Miss Stacy wants to\n",
      "see Miss Barry's willowware platter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne hastened to the sitting room closet to get the platter. She had,\n",
      "in accordance with her promise to Mrs. Lynde, written to Miss Barry of\n",
      "Charlottetown, asking for the loan of it. Miss Barry was an old friend\n",
      "of Anne's, and she promptly sent the platter out, with a letter exhorting\n",
      "Anne to be very careful of it, for she had paid twenty dollars for it.\n",
      "The platter had served its purpose at the Aid bazaar and had then been\n",
      "returned to the Green Gables closet, for Anne would not trust anybody\n",
      "but herself to take it back to town.\n",
      "\n",
      "She carried the platter carefully to the front door where her guests\n",
      "were enjoying the cool breeze that blew up from the brook. It was\n",
      "examined and admired; then, just as Anne had taken it back into her own\n",
      "hands, a terrific crash and clatter sounded from the kitchen pantry.\n",
      "Marilla, Diana, and Anne fled out, the latter pausing only long enough\n",
      "to set the precious platter hastily down on the second step of the\n",
      "stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they reached the pantry a truly harrowing spectacle met their eyes\n",
      ". . . a guilty looking small boy scrambling down from the table, with his\n",
      "clean print blouse liberally plastered with yellow filling, and on the\n",
      "table the shattered remnants of what had been two brave, becreamed lemon\n",
      "pies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Davy had finished ravelling out his herring net and had wound the twine\n",
      "into a ball. Then he had gone into the pantry to put it up on the shelf\n",
      "above the table, where he already kept a score or so of similar balls,\n",
      "which, so far as could be discovered, served no useful purpose save to\n",
      "yield the joy of possession. Davy had to climb on the table and reach\n",
      "over to the shelf at a dangerous angle . . . something he had been\n",
      "forbidden by Marilla to do, as he had come to grief once before in the\n",
      "experiment. The result in this instance was disastrous. Davy slipped\n",
      "and came sprawling squarely down on the lemon pies. His clean blouse was\n",
      "ruined for that time and the pies for all time. It is, however, an ill\n",
      "wind that blows nobody good, and the pig was eventually the gainer by\n",
      "Davy's mischance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Davy Keith,\" said Marilla, shaking him by the shoulder, \"didn't I\n",
      "forbid you to climb up on that table again? Didn't I?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I forgot,\" whimpered Davy. \"You've told me not to do such an awful lot\n",
      "of things that I can't remember them all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, you march upstairs and stay there till after dinner. Perhaps\n",
      "you'll get them sorted out in your memory by that time. No, Anne, never\n",
      "you mind interceding for him. I'm not punishing him because he\n",
      "spoiled your pies . . . that was an accident. I'm punishing him for his\n",
      "disobedience. Go, Davy, I say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ain't I to have any dinner?\" wailed Davy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can come down after dinner is over and have yours in the kitchen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, all right,\" said Davy, somewhat comforted. \"I know Anne'll save\n",
      "some nice bones for me, won't you, Anne? 'Cause you know I didn't mean\n",
      "to fall on the pies. Say, Anne, since they ARE spoiled can't I take some\n",
      "of the pieces upstairs with me?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, no lemon pie for you, Master Davy,\" said Marilla, pushing him\n",
      "toward the hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What shall we do for dessert?\" asked Anne, looking regretfully at the\n",
      "wreck and ruin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get out a crock of strawberry preserves,\" said Marilla consolingly.\n",
      "\"There's plenty of whipped cream left in the bowl for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "One o'clock came . . . but no Priscilla or Mrs. Morgan. Anne was in an\n",
      "agony. Everything was done to a turn and the soup was just what soup\n",
      "should be, but couldn't be depended on to remain so for any length of\n",
      "time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't believe they're coming after all,\" said Marilla crossly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne and Diana sought comfort in each other's eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "At half past one Marilla again emerged from the parlor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Girls, we MUST have dinner. Everybody is hungry and it's no use waiting\n",
      "any longer. Priscilla and Mrs. Morgan are not coming, that's plain, and\n",
      "nothing is being improved by waiting.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne and Diana set about lifting the dinner, with all the zest gone out\n",
      "of the performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't believe I'll be able to eat a mouthful,\" said Diana dolefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nor I. But I hope everything will be nice for Miss Stacy's and Mr. and\n",
      "Mrs. Allan's sakes,\" said Anne listlessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Diana dished the peas she tasted them and a very peculiar\n",
      "expression crossed her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anne, did YOU put sugar in these peas?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Anne, mashing the potatoes with the air of one expected to\n",
      "do her duty. \"I put a spoonful of sugar in. We always do. Don't you like\n",
      "it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But _I_ put a spoonful in too, when I set them on the stove,\" said\n",
      "Diana.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne dropped her masher and tasted the peas also. Then she made a\n",
      "grimace.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How awful! I never dreamed you had put sugar in, because I knew your\n",
      "mother never does. I happened to think of it, for a wonder . . .  I'm\n",
      "always forgetting it . . . so I popped a spoonful in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a case of too many cooks, I guess,\" said Marilla, who had listened\n",
      "to this dialogue with a rather guilty expression. \"I didn't think you'd\n",
      "remember about the sugar, Anne, for I'm perfectly certain you never did\n",
      "before . . . so _I_ put in a spoonful.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The guests in the parlor heard peal after peal of laughter from the\n",
      "kitchen, but they never knew what the fun was about. There were no green\n",
      "peas on the dinner table that day, however.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Anne, sobering down again with a sigh of recollection, \"we\n",
      "have the salad anyhow and I don't think anything has happened to the\n",
      "beans. Let's carry the things in and get it over.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It cannot be said that that dinner was a notable success socially.\n",
      "The Allans and Miss Stacy exerted themselves to save the situation and\n",
      "Marilla's customary placidity was not noticeably ruffled. But Anne\n",
      "and Diana, between their disappointment and the reaction from their\n",
      "excitement of the forenoon, could neither talk nor eat. Anne tried\n",
      "heroically to bear her part in the conversation for the sake of her\n",
      "guests; but all the sparkle had been quenched in her for the time being,\n",
      "and, in spite of her love for the Allans and Miss Stacy, she couldn't\n",
      "help thinking how nice it would be when everybody had gone home and she\n",
      "could bury her weariness and disappointment in the pillows of the east\n",
      "gable.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is an old proverb that really seems at times to be inspired . . .\n",
      "\"it never rains but it pours.\" The measure of that day's tribulations\n",
      "was not yet full. Just as Mr. Allan had finished returning thanks there\n",
      "arose a strange, ominous sound on the stairs, as of some hard, heavy\n",
      "object bounding from step to step, finishing up with a grand smash\n",
      "at the bottom. Everybody ran out into the hall. Anne gave a shriek of\n",
      "dismay.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the bottom of the stairs lay a big pink conch shell amid the\n",
      "fragments of what had been Miss Barry's platter; and at the top of the\n",
      "stairs knelt a terrified Davy, gazing down with wide-open eyes at the\n",
      "havoc.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Davy,\" said Marilla ominously, \"did you throw that conch down ON\n",
      "PURPOSE?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I never did,\" whimpered Davy. \"I was just kneeling here, quiet as\n",
      "quiet, to watch you folks through the bannisters, and my foot struck\n",
      "that old thing and pushed it off . . . and I'm awful hungry . . . and I\n",
      "do wish you'd lick a fellow and have done with it, instead of always\n",
      "sending him upstairs to miss all the fun.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't blame Davy,\" said Anne, gathering up the fragments with trembling\n",
      "fingers. \"It was my fault. I set that platter there and forgot all about\n",
      "it. I am properly punished for my carelessness; but oh, what will Miss\n",
      "Barry say?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, you know she only bought it, so it isn't the same as if it was an\n",
      "heirloom,\" said Diana, trying to console.\n",
      "\n",
      "The guests went away soon after, feeling that it was the most tactful\n",
      "thing to do, and Anne and Diana washed the dishes, talking less than\n",
      "they had ever been known to do before. Then Diana went home with a\n",
      "headache and Anne went with another to the east gable, where she stayed\n",
      "until Marilla came home from the post office at sunset, with a letter\n",
      "from Priscilla, written the day before. Mrs. Morgan had sprained her\n",
      "ankle so severely that she could not leave her room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And oh, Anne dear,\" wrote Priscilla, \"I'm so sorry, but I'm afraid we\n",
      "won't get up to Green Gables at all now, for by the time Aunty's ankle\n",
      "is well she will have to go back to Toronto. She has to be there by a\n",
      "certain date.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" sighed Anne, laying the letter down on the red sandstone step\n",
      "of the back porch, where she was sitting, while the twilight rained down\n",
      "out of a dappled sky, \"I always thought it was too good to be true that\n",
      "Mrs. Morgan should really come. But there . . . that speech sounds as\n",
      "pessimistic as Miss Eliza Andrews and I'm ashamed of making it. After\n",
      "all, it was NOT too good to be true . . . things just as good and far\n",
      "better are coming true for me all the time. And I suppose the events of\n",
      "today have a funny side too. Perhaps when Diana and I are old and gray\n",
      "we shall be able to laugh over them. But I feel that I can't expect to\n",
      "do it before then, for it has truly been a bitter disappointment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll probably have a good many more and worse disappointments than\n",
      "that before you get through life,\" said Marilla, who honestly thought\n",
      "she was making a comforting speech. \"It seems to me, Anne, that you are\n",
      "never going to outgrow your fashion of setting your heart so on things\n",
      "and then crashing down into despair because you don't get them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know I'm too much inclined that, way\" agreed Anne ruefully. \"When I\n",
      "think something nice is going to happen I seem to fly right up on the\n",
      "wings of anticipation; and then the first thing I realize I drop down to\n",
      "earth with a thud. But really, Marilla, the flying part IS glorious\n",
      "as long as it lasts . . . it's like soaring through a sunset. I think it\n",
      "almost pays for the thud.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, maybe it does,\" admitted Marilla. \"I'd rather walk calmly along\n",
      "and do without both flying and thud. But everybody has her own way of\n",
      "living . . . I used to think there was only one right way  . . . but since\n",
      "I've had you and the twins to bring up I don't feel so sure of it. What\n",
      "are you going to do about Miss Barry's platter?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pay her back the twenty dollars she paid for it, I suppose. I'm so\n",
      "thankful it wasn't a cherished heirloom because then no money could\n",
      "replace it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Maybe you could find one like it somewhere and buy it for her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid not. Platters as old as that are very scarce. Mrs. Lynde\n",
      "couldn't find one anywhere for the supper. I only wish I could, for of\n",
      "course Miss Barry would just as soon have one platter as another, if\n",
      "both were equally old and genuine. Marilla, look at that big star over\n",
      "Mr. Harrison's maple grove, with all that holy hush of silvery sky about\n",
      "it. It gives me a feeling that is like a prayer. After all, when one\n",
      "can see stars and skies like that, little disappointments and accidents\n",
      "can't matter so much, can they?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Where's Davy?\" said Marilla, with an indifferent glance at the star.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In bed. I've promised to take him and Dora to the shore for a picnic\n",
      "tomorrow. Of course, the original agreement was that he must be good.\n",
      "But he TRIED to be good . . . and I hadn't the heart to disappoint him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll drown yourself or the twins, rowing about the pond in that\n",
      "flat,\" grumbled Marilla. \"I've lived here for sixty years and I've never\n",
      "been on the pond yet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, it's never too late to mend,\" said Anne roguishly. \"Suppose you\n",
      "come with us tomorrow. We'll shut Green Gables up and spend the whole\n",
      "day at the shore, daffing the world aside.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, thank you,\" said Marilla, with indignant emphasis. \"I'd be a nice\n",
      "sight, wouldn't I, rowing down the pond in a flat? I think I hear Rachel\n",
      "pronouncing on it. There's Mr. Harrison driving away somewhere. Do you\n",
      "suppose there is any truth in the gossip that Mr. Harrison is going to\n",
      "see Isabella Andrews?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I'm sure there isn't. He just called there one evening on business\n",
      "with Mr. Harmon Andrews and Mrs. Lynde saw him and said she knew he was\n",
      "courting because he had a white collar on. I don't believe Mr. Harrison\n",
      "will ever marry. He seems to have a prejudice against marriage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, you can never tell about those old bachelors. And if he had a\n",
      "white collar on I'd agree with Rachel that it looks suspicious, for I'm\n",
      "sure he never was seen with one before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think he only put it on because he wanted to conclude a business deal\n",
      "with Harmon Andrews,\" said Anne. \"I've heard him say that's the only\n",
      "time a man needs to be particular about his appearance, because if he\n",
      "looks prosperous the party of the second part won't be so likely to try\n",
      "to cheat him. I really feel sorry for Mr. Harrison; I don't believe he\n",
      "feels satisfied with his life. It must be very lonely to have no one to\n",
      "care about except a parrot, don't you think? But I notice Mr. Harrison\n",
      "doesn't like to be pitied. Nobody does, I imagine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's Gilbert coming up the lane,\" said Marilla. \"If he wants you to\n",

      "\"If you mean ECONOMICAL, it's a VERY different thing from being stingy.\n",
      "It is an excellent trait in a person if she is economical. If Marilla\n",
      "had been stingy she wouldn't have taken you and Dora when your mother\n",
      "died. Would you have liked to live with Mrs. Wiggins?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You just bet I wouldn't!\" Davy was emphatic on that point. \"Nor I don't\n",
      "want to go out to Uncle Richard neither. I'd far rather live here, even\n",
      "if Marilla is that long-tailed word when it comes to jam, 'cause YOU'RE\n",
      "here, Anne. Say, Anne, won't you tell me a story 'fore I go to sleep? I\n",
      "don't want a fairy story. They're all right for girls, I s'pose, but I\n",
      "want something exciting . . . lots of killing and shooting in it, and a\n",

      "\"Anne, Diana's signaling at a great rate. You'd better see what she\n",
      "wants.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne ran to the east gable and saw flashes of light coming through the\n",
      "twilight from Diana's window in groups of five, which meant, according\n",
      "to their old childish code, \"Come over at once for I have something\n",
      "important to reveal.\" Anne threw her white shawl over her head and\n",
      "hastened through the Haunted Wood and across Mr. Bell's pasture corner\n",
      "to Orchard Slope.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've good news for you, Anne,\" said Diana. \"Mother and I have just\n",
      "got home from Carmody, and I saw Mary Sentner from Spencer vale in\n",
      "Mr. Blair's store. She says the old Copp girls on the Tory Road have a\n",
      "willow-ware platter and she thinks it's exactly like the one we had at\n",
      "the supper. She says they'll likely sell it, for Martha Copp has never\n",
      "been known to keep anything she COULD sell; but if they won't there's a\n",
      "platter at Wesley Keyson's at Spencervale and she knows they'd sell it,\n",
      "but she isn't sure it's just the same kind as Aunt Josephine's.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll go right over to Spencervale after it tomorrow,\" said Anne\n",
      "resolutely, \"and you must come with me. It will be such a weight off\n",
      "my mind, for I have to go to town day after tomorrow and how can I face\n",
      "your Aunt Josephine without a willow-ware platter? It would be even\n",
      "worse than the time I had to confess about jumping on the spare room\n",
      "bed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Both girls laughed over the old memory . . . concerning which, if any of\n",
      "my readers are ignorant and curious, I must refer them to Anne's earlier\n",
      "history.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next afternoon the girls fared forth on their platter hunting\n",
      "expedition. It was ten miles to Spencervale and the day was not\n",
      "especially pleasant for traveling. It was very warm and windless, and\n",
      "the dust on the road was such as might have been expected after six\n",
      "weeks of dry weather.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I do wish it would rain soon,\" sighed Anne. \"Everything is so\n",
      "parched up. The poor fields just seem pitiful to me and the trees seem\n",
      "to be stretching out their hands pleading for rain. As for my garden, it\n",
      "hurts me every time I go into it. I suppose I shouldn't complain about\n",
      "a garden when the farmers' crops are suffering so. Mr. Harrison says his\n",
      "pastures are so scorched up that his poor cows can hardly get a bite to\n",
      "eat and he feels guilty of cruelty to animals every time he meets their\n",
      "eyes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After a wearisome drive the girls reached Spencervale and turned down\n",
      "the \"Tory\" Road . . . a green, solitary highway where the strips of grass\n",
      "between the wheel tracks bore evidence to lack of travel. Along most of\n",
      "its extent it was lined with thick-set young spruces crowding down\n",
      "to the roadway, with here and there a break where the back field of\n",
      "a Spencervale farm came out to the fence or an expanse of stumps was\n",
      "aflame with fireweed and goldenrod.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why is it called the Tory Road?\" asked Anne.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Allan says it is on the principle of calling a place a grove\n",
      "because there are no trees in it,\" said Diana, \"for nobody lives along\n",
      "the road except the Copp girls and old Martin Bovyer at the further end,\n",
      "who is a Liberal. The Tory government ran the road through when they\n",
      "were in power just to show they were doing something.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Diana's father was a Liberal, for which reason she and Anne never\n",
      "discussed politics. Green Gables folk had always been Conservatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally the girls came to the old Copp homestead . . . a place of such\n",
      "exceeding external neatness that even Green Gables would have suffered\n",
      "by contrast. The house was a very old-fashioned one, situated on a\n",
      "slope, which fact had necessitated the building of a stone basement\n",
      "under one end. The house and out-buildings were all whitewashed to a\n",
      "condition of blinding perfection and not a weed was visible in the prim\n",
      "kitchen garden surrounded by its white paling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The shades are all down,\" said Diana ruefully. \"I believe that nobody\n",
      "is home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This proved to be the case. The girls looked at each other in\n",
      "perplexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know what to do,\" said Anne. \"If I were sure the platter was\n",
      "the right kind I would not mind waiting until they came home. But if it\n",
      "isn't it may be too late to go to Wesley Keyson's afterward.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Diana looked at a certain little square window over the basement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is the pantry window, I feel sure,\" she said, \"because this house\n",
      "is just like Uncle Charles' at Newbridge, and that is their pantry\n",
      "window. The shade isn't down, so if we climbed up on the roof of that\n",
      "little house we could look into the pantry and might be able to see the\n",
      "platter. Do you think it would be any harm?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I don't think so,\" decided Anne, after due reflection, \"since our\n",
      "motive is not idle curiosity.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This important point of ethics being settled, Anne prepared to mount the\n",
      "aforesaid \"little house,\" a construction of lathes, with a peaked roof,\n",
      "which had in times past served as a habitation for ducks. The Copp girls\n",
      "had given up keeping ducks . . . \"because they were such untidy birds\". .\n",
      ". and the house had not been in use for some years, save as an abode of\n",
      "correction for setting hens. Although scrupulously whitewashed it had\n",
      "become somewhat shaky, and Anne felt rather dubious as she scrambled up\n",
      "from the vantage point of a keg placed on a box.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid it won't bear my weight,\" she said as she gingerly stepped\n",
      "on the roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lean on the window sill,\" advised Diana, and Anne accordingly leaned.\n",
      "Much to her delight, she saw, as she peered through the pane, a\n",
      "willow-ware platter, exactly such as she was in quest of, on the shelf\n",
      "in front of the window. So much she saw before the catastrophe came. In\n",
      "her joy Anne forgot the precarious nature of her footing, incautiously\n",
      "ceased to lean on the window sill, gave an impulsive little hop of\n",
      "pleasure . . . and the next moment she had crashed through the roof up\n",
      "to her armpits, and there she hung, quite unable to extricate herself.\n",
      "Diana dashed into the duck house and, seizing her unfortunate friend by\n",
      "the waist, tried to draw her down.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ow . . . don't,\" shrieked poor Anne. \"There are some long splinters\n",
      "sticking into me. See if you can put something under my feet . . . then\n",
      "perhaps I can draw myself up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Diana hastily dragged in the previously mentioned keg and Anne found\n",
      "that it was just sufficiently high to furnish a secure resting place for\n",
      "her feet. But she could not release herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Could I pull you out if I crawled up?\" suggested Diana.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne shook her head hopelessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No . . . the splinters hurt too badly. If you can find an axe you might\n",
      "chop me out, though. Oh dear, I do really begin to believe that I was\n",
      "born under an ill-omened star.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Diana searched faithfully but no axe was to be found.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll have to go for help,\" she said, returning to the prisoner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, indeed, you won't,\" said Anne vehemently. \"If you do the story of\n",
      "this will get out everywhere and I shall be ashamed to show my face.\n",
      "No, we must just wait until the Copp girls come home and bind them\n",
      "to secrecy. They'll know where the axe is and get me out. I'm not\n",
      "uncomfortable, as long as I keep perfectly still . . .  not uncomfortable\n",
      "in BODY I mean. I wonder what the Copp girls value this house at. I\n",
      "shall have to pay for the damage I've done, but I wouldn't mind that if\n",
      "I were only sure they would understand my motive in peeping in at their\n",
      "pantry window. My sole comfort is that the platter is just the kind I\n",
      "want and if Miss Copp will only sell it to me I shall be resigned to\n",
      "what has happened.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What if the Copp girls don't come home until after night . . . or till\n",
      "tomorrow?\" suggested Diana.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If they're not back by sunset you'll have to go for other assistance,\n",
      "I suppose,\" said Anne reluctantly, \"but you mustn't go until you really\n",
      "have to. Oh dear, this is a dreadful predicament. I wouldn't mind my\n",
      "misfortunes so much if they were romantic, as Mrs. Morgan's heroines'\n",
      "always are, but they are always just simply ridiculous. Fancy what the\n",
      "Copp girls will think when they drive into their yard and see a girl's\n",
      "head and shoulders sticking out of the roof of one of their outhouses.\n",
      "Listen . . . is that a wagon? No, Diana, I believe it is thunder.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Thunder it was undoubtedly, and Diana, having made a hasty pilgrimage\n",
      "around the house, returned to announce that a very black cloud was\n",
      "rising rapidly in the northwest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I believe we're going to have a heavy thunder-shower,\" she exclaimed in\n",
      "dismay, \"Oh, Anne, what will we do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We must prepare for it,\" said Anne tranquilly. A thunderstorm seemed a\n",
      "trifle in comparison with what had already happened. \"You'd better drive\n",
      "the horse and buggy into that open shed. Fortunately my parasol is in\n",
      "the buggy. Here . . . take my hat with you. Marilla told me I was a goose\n",
      "to put on my best hat to come to the Tory Road and she was right, as she\n",
      "always is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Diana untied the pony and drove into the shed, just as the first heavy\n",
      "drops of rain fell. There she sat and watched the resulting downpour,\n",
      "which was so thick and heavy that she could hardly see Anne through it,\n",
      "holding the parasol bravely over her bare head. There was not a great\n",
      "deal of thunder, but for the best part of an hour the rain came\n",
      "merrily down. Occasionally Anne slanted back her parasol and waved an\n",
      "encouraging hand to her friend; But conversation at that distance was\n",
      "quite out of the question. Finally the rain ceased, the sun came out,\n",
      "and Diana ventured across the puddles of the yard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you get very wet?\" she asked anxiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no,\" returned Anne cheerfully. \"My head and shoulders are quite\n",
      "dry and my skirt is only a little damp where the rain beat through the\n",
      "lathes. Don't pity me, Diana, for I haven't minded it at all. I kept\n",
      "thinking how much good the rain will do and how glad my garden must be\n",
      "for it, and imagining what the flowers and buds would think when the\n",
      "drops began to fall. I imagined out a most interesting dialogue between\n",
      "the asters and the sweet peas and the wild canaries in the lilac bush\n",
      "and the guardian spirit of the garden. When I go home I mean to write\n",
      "it down. I wish I had a pencil and paper to do it now, because I daresay\n",
      "I'll forget the best parts before I reach home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Diana the faithful had a pencil and discovered a sheet of wrapping paper\n",
      "in the box of the buggy. Anne folded up her dripping parasol, put on her\n",
      "hat, spread the wrapping paper on a shingle Diana handed up, and wrote\n",
      "out her garden idyl under conditions that could hardly be considered as\n",
      "favorable to literature. Nevertheless, the result was quite pretty, and\n",
      "Diana was \"enraptured\" when Anne read it to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Anne, it's sweet . . . just sweet. DO send it to the 'Canadian\n",
      "Woman.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne shook her head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no, it wouldn't be suitable at all. There is no PLOT in it, you\n",
      "see. It's just a string of fancies. I like writing such things, but of\n",
      "course nothing of the sort would ever do for publication, for editors\n",
      "insist on plots, so Priscilla says. Oh, there's Miss Sarah Copp now.\n",
      "PLEASE, Diana, go and explain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Sarah Copp was a small person, garbed in shabby black, with a hat\n",
      "chosen less for vain adornment than for qualities that would wear well.\n",
      "She looked as amazed as might be expected on seeing the curious\n",
      "tableau in her yard, but when she heard Diana's explanation she was all\n",
      "sympathy. She hurriedly unlocked the back door, produced the axe, and\n",
      "with a few skillfull blows set Anne free. The latter, somewhat tired\n",
      "and stiff, ducked down into the interior of her prison and thankfully\n",
      "emerged into liberty once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Copp,\" she said earnestly. \"I assure you I looked into your pantry\n",
      "window only to discover if you had a willow-ware platter. I didn't see\n",
      "anything else--I didn't LOOK for anything else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless you, that's all right,\" said Miss Sarah amiably. \"You needn't\n",
      "worry--there's no harm done. Thank goodness, we Copps keep our pantries\n",
      "presentable at all times and don't care who sees into them. As for that\n",
      "old duckhouse, I'm glad it's smashed, for maybe now Martha will agree to\n",
      "having it taken down. She never would before for fear it might come in\n",
      "handy sometime and I've had to whitewash it every spring. But you might\n",
      "as well argue with a post as with Martha. She went to town today--I\n",
      "drove her to the station. And you want to buy my platter. Well, what\n",
      "will you give for it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Twenty dollars,\" said Anne, who was never meant to match business wits\n",
      "with a Copp, or she would not have offered her price at the start.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I'll see,\" said Miss Sarah cautiously. \"That platter is mine\n",
      "fortunately, or I'd never dare to sell it when Martha wasn't here. As\n",
      "it is, I daresay she'll raise a fuss. Martha's the boss of this\n",
      "establishment I can tell you. I'm getting awful tired of living under\n",
      "another woman's thumb. But come in, come in. You must be real tired and\n",
      "hungry. I'll do the best I can for you in the way of tea but I warn you\n",
      "not to expect anything but bread and butter and some cowcumbers. Martha\n",
      "locked up all the cake and cheese and preserves afore she went. She\n",
      "always does, because she says I'm too extravagant with them if company\n",
      "comes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The girls were hungry enough to do justice to any fare, and they enjoyed\n",
      "Miss Sarah's excellent bread and butter and \"cowcumbers\" thoroughly.\n",
      "When the meal was over Miss Sarah said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know as I mind selling the platter. But it's worth twenty-five\n",
      "dollars. It's a very old platter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Diana gave Anne's foot a gentle kick under the table, meaning, \"Don't\n",
      "agree--she'll let it go for twenty if you hold out.\" But Anne was not\n",
      "minded to take any chances in regard to that precious platter. She\n",
      "promptly agreed to give twenty-five and Miss Sarah looked as if she felt\n",
      "sorry she hadn't asked for thirty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I guess you may have it. I want all the money I can scare up just\n",
      "now. The fact is--\" Miss Sarah threw up her head importantly, with a\n",
      "proud flush on her thin cheeks--\"I'm going to be married--to Luther\n",
      "Wallace. He wanted me twenty years ago. I liked him real well but he was\n",
      "poor then and father packed him off. I s'pose I shouldn't have let him\n",
      "go so meek but I was timid and frightened of father. Besides, I didn't\n",
      "know men were so skurse.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the girls were safely away, Diana driving and Anne holding\n",
      "the coveted platter carefully on her lap, the green, rain-freshened\n",
      "solitudes of the Tory Road were enlivened by ripples of girlish\n",
      "laughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll amuse your Aunt Josephine with the 'strange eventful history' of\n",
      "this afternoon when I go to town tomorrow. We've had a rather trying\n",
      "time but it's over now. I've got the platter, and that rain has laid the\n",
      "dust beautifully. So 'all's well that ends well.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We're not home yet,\" said Diana rather pessimistically, \"and there's\n",
      "no telling what may happen before we are. You're such a girl to have\n",
      "adventures, Anne.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "Just a Happy Day\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"After all,\" Anne had said to Marilla once, \"I believe the nicest and\n",
      "sweetest days are not those on which anything very splendid or wonderful\n",
      "or exciting happens but just those that bring simple little pleasures,\n",
      "following one another softly, like pearls slipping off a string.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Life at Green Gables was full of just such days, for Anne's adventures\n",
      "and misadventures, like those of other people, did not all happen at\n",
      "once, but were sprinkled over the year, with long stretches of harmless,\n",
      "happy days between, filled with work and dreams and laughter and\n",
      "lessons. Such a day came late in August. In the forenoon Anne and Diana\n",
      "rowed the delighted twins down the pond to the sandshore to pick \"sweet\n",
      "grass\" and paddle in the surf, over which the wind was harping an old\n",
      "lyric learned when the world was young.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the afternoon Anne walked down to the old Irving place to see Paul.\n",
      "She found him stretched out on the grassy bank beside the thick fir\n",
      "grove that sheltered the house on the north, absorbed in a book of fairy\n",
      "tales. He sprang up radiantly at sight of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I'm so glad you've come, teacher,\" he said eagerly, \"because\n",
      "Grandma's away. You'll stay and have tea with me, won't you? It's so\n",
      "lonesome to have tea all by oneself. YOU know, teacher. I've had serious\n",
      "thoughts of asking Young Mary Joe to sit down and eat her tea with me,\n",
      "but I expect Grandma wouldn't approve. She says the French have to be\n",
      "kept in their place. And anyhow, it's difficult to talk with Young Mary\n",
      "Joe. She just laughs and says, 'Well, yous do beat all de kids I ever\n",
      "knowed.' That isn't my idea of conversation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course I'll stay to tea,\" said Anne gaily. \"I was dying to be asked.\n",
      "My mouth has been watering for some more of your grandma's delicious\n",
      "shortbread ever since I had tea here before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul looked very sober.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If it depended on me, teacher,\" he said, standing before Anne with his\n",
      "hands in his pockets and his beautiful little face shadowed with sudden\n",
      "care, \"You should have shortbread with a right good will. But it depends\n",
      "on Mary Joe. I heard Grandma tell her before she left that she wasn't to\n",
      "give me any shortcake because it was too rich for little boys' stomachs.\n",
      "But maybe Mary Joe will cut some for you if I promise I won't eat any.\n",
      "Let us hope for the best.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, let us,\" agreed Anne, whom this cheerful philosophy suited\n",
      "exactly, \"and if Mary Joe proves hard-hearted and won't give me any\n",
      "shortbread it doesn't matter in the least, so you are not to worry over\n",
      "that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're sure you won't mind if she doesn't?\" said Paul anxiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perfectly sure, dear heart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I won't worry,\" said Paul, with a long breath of relief,\n",
      "\"especially as I really think Mary Joe will listen to reason. She's not\n",
      "a naturally unreasonable person, but she has learned by experience that\n",
      "it doesn't do to disobey Grandma's orders. Grandma is an excellent woman\n",
      "but people must do as she tells them. She was very much pleased with\n",
      "me this morning because I managed at last to eat all my plateful of\n",
      "porridge. It was a great effort but I succeeded. Grandma says she thinks\n",
      "she'll make a man of me yet. But, teacher, I want to ask you a very\n",
      "important question. You will answer it truthfully, won't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll try,\" promised Anne.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you think I'm wrong in my upper story?\" asked Paul, as if his very\n",
      "existence depended on her reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Goodness, no, Paul,\" exclaimed Anne in amazement. \"Certainly you're\n",
      "not. What put such an idea into your head?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mary Joe . . . but she didn't know I heard her. Mrs. Peter Sloane's\n",
      "hired girl, Veronica, came to see Mary Joe last evening and I heard them\n",
      "talking in the kitchen as I was going through the hall. I heard Mary Joe\n",
      "say, 'Dat Paul, he is de queeres' leetle boy. He talks dat queer. I tink\n",
      "dere's someting wrong in his upper story.' I couldn't sleep last night\n",
      "for ever so long, thinking of it, and wondering if Mary Joe was right. I\n",
      "couldn't bear to ask Grandma about it somehow, but I made up my mind I'd\n",
      "ask you. I'm so glad you think I'm all right in my upper story.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course you are. Mary Joe is a silly, ignorant girl, and you are\n",
      "never to worry about anything she says,\" said Anne indignantly, secretly\n",
      "resolving to give Mrs. Irving a discreet hint as to the advisability of\n",
      "restraining Mary Joe's tongue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, that's a weight off my mind,\" said Paul. \"I'm perfectly happy\n",
      "now, teacher, thanks to you. It wouldn't be nice to have something wrong\n",
      "in your upper story, would it, teacher? I suppose the reason Mary\n",
      "Joe imagines I have is because I tell her what I think about things\n",
      "sometimes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is a rather dangerous practice,\" admitted Anne, out of the depths of\n",
      "her own experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, by and by I'll tell you the thoughts I told Mary Joe and you can\n",
      "see for yourself if there's anything queer in them,\" said Paul, \"but\n",
      "I'll wait till it begins to get dark. That is the time I ache to tell\n",
      "people things, and when nobody else is handy I just HAVE to tell Mary\n",
      "Joe. But after this I won't, if it makes her imagine I'm wrong in my\n",
      "upper story. I'll just ache and bear it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And if the ache gets too bad you can come up to Green Gables and tell\n",
      "me your thoughts,\" suggested Anne, with all the gravity that endeared\n",
      "her to children, who so dearly love to be taken seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I will. But I hope Davy won't be there when I go because he makes\n",
      "faces at me. I don't mind VERY much because he is such a little boy and\n",
      "I am quite a big one, but still it is not pleasant to have faces made\n",
      "at you. And Davy makes such terrible ones. Sometimes I am frightened he\n",
      "will never get his face straightened out again. He makes them at me\n",
      "in church when I ought to be thinking of sacred things. Dora likes me\n",
      "though, and I like her, but not so well as I did before she told\n",
      "Minnie May Barry that she meant to marry me when I grew up. I may marry\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Rather young,\" agreed teacher.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Speaking of marrying, reminds me of another thing that has been\n",
      "troubling me of late,\" continued Paul. \"Mrs. Lynde was down here one\n",
      "day last week having tea with Grandma, and Grandma made me show her\n",
      "my little mother's picture . . . the one father sent me for my birthday\n",
      "present. I didn't exactly want to show it to Mrs. Lynde. Mrs. Lynde is a\n",
      "good, kind woman, but she isn't the sort of person you want to show your\n",
      "mother's picture to. YOU know, teacher. But of course I obeyed Grandma.\n",
      "Mrs. Lynde said she was very pretty but kind of actressy looking, and\n",
      "must have been an awful lot younger than father. Then she said, 'Some of\n",
      "these days your pa will be marrying again likely. How will you like to\n",
      "have a new ma, Master Paul?' Well, the idea almost took my breath away,\n",
      "teacher, but I wasn't going to let Mrs. Lynde see THAT. I just looked\n",
      "her straight in the face . . . like this . . . and I said, 'Mrs. Lynde,\n",
      "father made a pretty good job of picking out my first mother and I could\n",
      "trust him to pick out just as good a one the second time.' And I CAN\n",
      "trust him, teacher. But still, I hope, if he ever does give me a new\n",
      "mother, he'll ask my opinion about her before it's too late. There's\n",
      "Mary Joe coming to call us to tea. I'll go and consult with her about\n",
      "the shortbread.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of the \"consultation,\" Mary Joe cut the shortbread and added\n",
      "a dish of preserves to the bill of fare. Anne poured the tea and she\n",
      "and Paul had a very merry meal in the dim old sitting room whose windows\n",
      "were open to the gulf breezes, and they talked so much \"nonsense\" that\n",
      "Mary Joe was quite scandalized and told Veronica the next evening that\n",
      "\"de school mees\" was as queer as Paul. After tea Paul took Anne up to\n",
      "his room to show her his mother's picture, which had been the mysterious\n",
      "birthday present kept by Mrs. Irving in the bookcase. Paul's little\n",
      "low-ceilinged room was a soft whirl of ruddy light from the sun that was\n",
      "setting over the sea and swinging shadows from the fir trees that grew\n",
      "close to the square, deep-set window. From out this soft glow and glamor\n",
      "shone a sweet, girlish face, with tender mother eyes, that was hanging\n",
      "on the wall at the foot of the bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's my little mother,\" said Paul with loving pride. \"I got Grandma\n",
      "to hang it there where I'd see it as soon as I opened my eyes in the\n",
      "morning. I never mind not having the light when I go to bed now, because\n",
      "it just seems as if my little mother was right here with me. Father knew\n",
      "just what I would like for a birthday present, although he never asked\n",
      "me. Isn't it wonderful how much fathers DO know?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your mother was very lovely, Paul, and you look a little like her. But\n",
      "her eyes and hair are darker than yours.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My eyes are the same color as father's,\" said Paul, flying about the\n",
      "room to heap all available cushions on the window seat, \"but father's\n",
      "hair is gray. He has lots of it, but it is gray. You see, father is\n",
      "nearly fifty. That's ripe old age, isn't it? But it's only OUTSIDE he's\n",
      "old. INSIDE he's just as young as anybody. Now, teacher, please sit\n",
      "here; and I'll sit at your feet. May I lay my head against your knee?\n",
      "That's the way my little mother and I used to sit. Oh, this is real\n",
      "splendid, I think.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, I want to hear those thoughts which Mary Joe pronounces so queer,\"\n",
      "said Anne, patting the mop of curls at her side. Paul never needed any\n",
      "coaxing to tell his thoughts . . . at least, to congenial souls.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought them out in the fir grove one night,\" he said dreamily. \"Of\n",
      "course I didn't BELIEVE them but I THOUGHT them. YOU know, teacher. And\n",
      "then I wanted to tell them to somebody and there was nobody but Mary\n",
      "Joe. Mary Joe was in the pantry setting bread and I sat down on the\n",
      "bench beside her and I said, 'Mary Joe, do you know what I think? I\n",
      "think the evening star is a lighthouse on the land where the fairies\n",
      "dwell.' And Mary Joe said, 'Well, yous are de queer one. Dare ain't no\n",
      "such ting as fairies.' I was very much provoked. Of course, I knew there\n",
      "are no fairies; but that needn't prevent my thinking there is. You know,\n",
      "teacher. But I tried again quite patiently. I said, 'Well then, Mary\n",
      "Joe, do you know what I think? I think an angel walks over the world\n",
      "after the sun sets . . . a great, tall, white angel, with silvery folded\n",
      "wings . . .  and sings the flowers and birds to sleep. Children can hear\n",
      "him if they know how to listen.' Then Mary Joe held up her hands all\n",
      "over flour and said, 'Well, yous are de queer leetle boy. Yous make\n",
      "me feel scare.' And she really did looked scared. I went out then and\n",
      "whispered the rest of my thoughts to the garden. There was a little\n",
      "birch tree in the garden and it died. Grandma says the salt spray\n",
      "killed it; but I think the dryad belonging to it was a foolish dryad who\n",
      "wandered away to see the world and got lost. And the little tree was so\n",
      "lonely it died of a broken heart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And when the poor, foolish little dryad gets tired of the world and\n",
      "comes back to her tree HER heart will break,\" said Anne.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; but if dryads are foolish they must take the consequences, just as\n",
      "if they were real people,\" said Paul gravely. \"Do you know what I think\n",
      "about the new moon, teacher? I think it is a little golden boat full of\n",
      "dreams.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And when it tips on a cloud some of them spill out and fall into your\n",
      "sleep.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Exactly, teacher. Oh, you DO know. And I think the violets are little\n",
      "snips of the sky that fell down when the angels cut out holes for the\n",
      "stars to shine through. And the buttercups are made out of old sunshine;\n",
      "and I think the sweet peas will be butterflies when they go to heaven.\n",
      "Now, teacher, do you see anything so very queer about those thoughts?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, laddie dear, they are not queer at all; they are strange and\n",
      "beautiful thoughts for a little boy to think, and so people who couldn't\n",
      "think anything of the sort themselves, if they tried for a hundred\n",
      "years, think them queer. But keep on thinking them, Paul  . . . some day\n",
      "you are going to be a poet, I believe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When Anne reached home she found a very different type of boyhood\n",
      "waiting to be put to bed. Davy was sulky; and when Anne had undressed\n",
      "him he bounced into bed and buried his face in the pillow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Davy, you have forgotten to say your prayers,\" said Anne rebukingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I didn't forget,\" said Davy defiantly, \"but I ain't going to say\n",
      "my prayers any more. I'm going to give up trying to be good, 'cause no\n",
      "matter how good I am you'd like Paul Irving better. So I might as well\n",
      "be bad and have the fun of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't like Paul Irving BETTER,\" said Anne seriously. \"I like you just\n",
      "as well, only in a different way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I want you to like me the same way,\" pouted Davy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can't like different people the same way. You don't like Dora and\n",
      "me the same way, do you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Davy sat up and reflected.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No . . . o . . . o,\" he admitted at last, \"I like Dora because she's my\n",
      "sister but I like you because you're YOU.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I like Paul because he is Paul and Davy because he is Davy,\" said\n",
      "Anne gaily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I kind of wish I'd said my prayers then,\" said Davy, convinced by\n",
      "this logic. \"But it's too much bother getting out now to say them. I'll\n",
      "say them twice over in the morning, Anne. Won't that do as well?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "No, Anne was positive it would not do as well. So Davy scrambled out\n",
      "and knelt down at her knee. When he had finished his devotions he leaned\n",
      "back on his little, bare, brown heels and looked up at her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anne, I'm gooder than I used to be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, indeed you are, Davy,\" said Anne, who never hesitated to give\n",
      "credit where credit was due.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I KNOW I'm gooder,\" said Davy confidently, \"and I'll tell you how I\n",
      "know it. Today Marilla give me two pieces of bread and jam, one for me\n",
      "and one for Dora. One was a good deal bigger than the other and Marilla\n",
      "didn't say which was mine. But I give the biggest piece to Dora. That\n",
      "was good of me, wasn't it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very good, and very manly, Davy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course,\" admitted Davy, \"Dora wasn't very hungry and she only et\n",
      "half her slice and then she give the rest to me. But I didn't know she\n",
      "was going to do that when I give it to her, so I WAS good, Anne.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the twilight Anne sauntered down to the Dryad's Bubble and saw\n",
      "Gilbert Blythe coming down through the dusky Haunted Wood. She had a\n",
      "sudden realization that Gilbert was a schoolboy no longer. And how manly\n",
      "he looked--the tall, frank-faced fellow, with the clear, straightforward\n",
      "eyes and the broad shoulders. Anne thought Gilbert was a very handsome\n",
      "lad, even though he didn't look at all like her ideal man. She and Diana\n",
      "had long ago decided what kind of a man they admired and their tastes\n",
      "seemed exactly similar. He must be very tall and distinguished looking,\n",
      "with melancholy, inscrutable eyes, and a melting, sympathetic voice.\n",
      "There was nothing either melancholy or inscrutable in Gilbert's\n",
      "physiognomy, but of course that didn't matter in friendship!\n",
      "\n",
      "Gilbert stretched himself out on the ferns beside the Bubble and looked\n",
      "approvingly at Anne. If Gilbert had been asked to describe his ideal\n",
      "woman the description would have answered point for point to Anne, even\n",
      "to those seven tiny freckles whose obnoxious presence still continued to\n",
      "vex her soul. Gilbert was as yet little more than a boy; but a boy has\n",
      "his dreams as have others, and in Gilbert's future there was always a\n",
      "girl with big, limpid gray eyes, and a face as fine and delicate as a\n",
      "flower. He had made up his mind, also, that his future must be worthy of\n",
      "its goddess. Even in quiet Avonlea there were temptations to be met\n",
      "and faced. White Sands youth were a rather \"fast\" set, and Gilbert was\n",
      "popular wherever he went. But he meant to keep himself worthy of Anne's\n",
      "friendship and perhaps some distant day her love; and he watched over\n",
      "word and thought and deed as jealously as if her clear eyes were to\n",
      "pass in judgment on it. She held over him the unconscious influence that\n",
      "every girl, whose ideals are high and pure, wields over her friends; an\n",
      "influence which would endure as long as she was faithful to those ideals\n",
      "and which she would as certainly lose if she were ever false to them. In\n",
      "Gilbert's eyes Anne's greatest charm was the fact that she never stooped\n",
      "to the petty practices of so many of the Avonlea girls--the small\n",
      "jealousies, the little deceits and rivalries, the palpable bids for\n",
      "favor. Anne held herself apart from all this, not consciously or of\n",
      "design, but simply because anything of the sort was utterly foreign\n",
      "to her transparent, impulsive nature, crystal clear in its motives and\n",
      "aspirations.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Gilbert did not attempt to put his thoughts into words, for he had\n",
      "already too good reason to know that Anne would mercilessly and frostily\n",
      "nip all attempts at sentiment in the bud--or laugh at him, which was ten\n",
      "times worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You look like a real dryad under that birch tree,\" he said teasingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I love birch trees,\" said Anne, laying her cheek against the creamy\n",
      "satin of the slim bole, with one of the pretty, caressing gestures that\n",
      "came so natural to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you'll be glad to hear that Mr. Major Spencer has decided to set\n",
      "out a row of white birches all along the road front of his farm, by way\n",
      "of encouraging the A.V.I.S.,\" said Gilbert. \"He was talking to me about\n",
      "it today. Major Spencer is the most progressive and public-spirited\n",
      "man in Avonlea. And Mr. William Bell is going to set out a spruce\n",
      "hedge along his road front and up his lane. Our Society is getting on\n",
      "splendidly, Anne. It is past the experimental stage and is an accepted\n",
      "fact. The older folks are beginning to take an interest in it and the\n",
      "White Sands people are talking of starting one too. Even Elisha Wright\n",
      "has come around since that day the Americans from the hotel had the\n",
      "picnic at the shore. They praised our roadsides so highly and said they\n",
      "were so much prettier than in any other part of the Island. And when, in\n",
      "due time, the other farmers follow Mr. Spencer's good example and plant\n",
      "ornamental trees and hedges along their road fronts Avonlea will be the\n",
      "prettiest settlement in the province.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Aids are talking of taking up the graveyard,\" said Anne, \"and I\n",
      "hope they will, because there will have to be a subscription for that,\n",
      "and it would be no use for the Society to try it after the hall affair.\n",
      "But the Aids would never have stirred in the matter if the Society\n",
      "hadn't put it into their thoughts unofficially. Those trees we planted\n",
      "on the church grounds are flourishing, and the trustees have promised\n",
      "me that they will fence in the school grounds next year. If they do I'll\n",
      "have an arbor day and every scholar shall plant a tree; and we'll have a\n",
      "garden in the corner by the road.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We've succeeded in almost all our plans so far, except in getting the\n",
      "old Boulter house removed,\" said Gilbert, \"and I've given THAT up\n",
      "in despair. Levi won't have it taken down just to vex us. There's a\n",
      "contrary streak in all the Boulters and it's strongly developed in him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Julia Bell wants to send another committee to him, but I think the\n",
      "better way will just be to leave him severely alone,\" said Anne sagely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And trust to Providence, as Mrs. Lynde says,\" smiled Gilbert.\n",
      "\"Certainly, no more committees. They only aggravate him. Julia Bell\n",
      "thinks you can do anything, if you only have a committee to attempt\n",
      "it. Next spring, Anne, we must start an agitation for nice lawns and\n",
      "grounds. We'll sow good seed betimes this winter. I've a treatise here\n",
      "on lawns and lawnmaking and I'm going to prepare a paper on the subject\n",
      "soon. Well, I suppose our vacation is almost over. School opens Monday.\n",
      "Has Ruby Gillis got the Carmody school?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; Priscilla wrote that she had taken her own home school, so the\n",
      "Carmody trustees gave it to Ruby. I'm sorry Priscilla is not coming\n",
      "back, but since she can't I'm glad Ruby has got the school. She will be\n",
      "home for Saturdays and it will seem like old times, to have her and Jane\n",
      "and Diana and myself all together again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marilla, just home from Mrs. Lynde's, was sitting on the back porch step\n",
      "when Anne returned to the house.\n",

      "\"Rachel and I have decided to have our cruise to town tomorrow,\" she\n",
      "said. \"Mr. Lynde is feeling better this week and Rachel wants to go\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I intend to get up extra early tomorrow morning, for I've ever so much\n",

      "wheatfield, a great, windrippled expanse of pale gold. The world was\n",
      "so beautiful that Anne spent ten blissful minutes hanging idly over the\n",

      "\n",
      "For alas, Marilla had stooped to the evil habit of bribing people to be\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I won't be bad on purpose, but s'posen I'm bad zacksidentally?\" Davy\n",
      "wanted to know.\n",

      "\"You'll have to guard against accidents,\" admonished Marilla. \"Anne, if\n",

      "you'll have to kill a fowl for dinner tomorrow.\"\n",

      "Anne nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not going to bother cooking any dinner for just Davy and myself\n",
      "today,\" she said. \"That cold ham bone will do for noon lunch and I'll\n",

      "Harrison is an awful kind man. He's a real sociable man. I hope I'll be\n",
      "like him when I grow up. I mean BEHAVE like him . . . I don't want to LOOK\n",
      "like him. But I guess there's no danger, for Mrs. Lynde says I'm a very\n",
      "handsome child. Do you s'pose it'll last, Anne? I want to know?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I daresay it will,\" said Anne gravely. \"You ARE a handsome boy, Davy,\"\n",
      " . . . Marilla looked volumes of disapproval . . . \"but you must live up to\n",
      "it and be just as nice and gentlemanly as you look to be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And you told Minnie May Barry the other day, when you found her crying\n",
      "'cause some one said she was ugly, that if she was nice and kind and\n",
      "loving people wouldn't mind her looks,\" said Davy discontentedly. \"Seems\n",
      "to me you can't get out of being good in this world for some reason or\n",
      "'nother. You just HAVE to behave.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you want to be good?\" asked Marilla, who had learned a great deal\n",
      "but had not yet learned the futility of asking such questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I want to be good but not TOO good,\" said Davy cautiously. \"You\n",
      "don't have to be very good to be a Sunday School superintendent. Mr.\n",
      "Bell's that, and he's a real bad man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed he's not,\" said Marila indignantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is . . . he says he is himself,\" asseverated Davy. \"He said it when\n",
      "he prayed in Sunday School last Sunday. He said he was a vile worm and\n",
      "a miserable sinner and guilty of the blackest 'niquity. What did he do\n",
      "that was so bad, Marilla? Did he kill anybody? Or steal the collection\n",
      "cents? I want to know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately Mrs. Lynde came driving up the lane at this moment and\n",
      "Marilla made off, feeling that she had escaped from the snare of the\n",
      "fowler, and wishing devoutly that Mr. Bell were not quite so highly\n",
      "figurative in his public petitions, especially in the hearing of small\n",
      "boys who were always \"wanting to know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne, left alone in her glory, worked with a will. The floor was swept,\n",
      "the beds made, the hens fed, the muslin dress washed and hung out on the\n",
      "line. Then Anne prepared for the transfer of feathers. She mounted to\n",
      "the garret and donned the first old dress that came to hand . . . a navy\n",
      "blue cashmere she had worn at fourteen. It was decidedly on the short\n",
      "side and as \"skimpy\" as the notable wincey Anne had worn upon the\n",
      "occasion of her debut at Green Gables; but at least it would not be\n",
      "materially injured by down and feathers. Anne completed her toilet by\n",
      "tying a big red and white spotted handkerchief that had belonged to\n",
      "Matthew over her head, and, thus accoutred, betook herself to the\n",
      "kitchen chamber, whither Marilla, before her departure, had helped her\n",
      "carry the feather bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "A cracked mirror hung by the chamber window and in an unlucky moment\n",
      "Anne looked into it. There were those seven freckles on her nose,\n",
      "more rampant than ever, or so it seemed in the glare of light from the\n",
      "unshaded window.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I forgot to rub that lotion on last night,\" she thought. \"I'd\n",
      "better run down to the pantry and do it now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne had already suffered many things trying to remove those freckles.\n",
      "On one occasion the entire skin had peeled off her nose but the freckles\n",
      "remained. A few days previously she had found a recipe for a freckle\n",
      "lotion in a magazine and, as the ingredients were within her reach, she\n",
      "straightway compounded it, much to the disgust of Marilla, who thought\n",
      "that if Providence had placed freckles on your nose it was your bounden\n",
      "duty to leave them there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne scurried down to the pantry, which, always dim from the big willow\n",
      "growing close to the window, was now almost dark by reason of the shade\n",
      "drawn to exclude flies. Anne caught the bottle containing the lotion\n",
      "from the shelf and copiously anointed her nose therewith by means of\n",
      "a little sponge sacred to the purpose. This important duty done, she\n",
      "returned to her work. Any one who has ever shifted feathers from one\n",
      "tick to another will not need to be told that when Anne finished she\n",
      "was a sight to behold. Her dress was white with down and fluff, and her\n",
      "front hair, escaping from under the handkerchief, was adorned with a\n",
      "veritable halo of feathers. At this auspicious moment a knock sounded at\n",
      "the kitchen door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That must be Mr. Shearer,\" thought Anne. \"I'm in a dreadful mess but\n",
      "I'll have to run down as I am, for he's always in a hurry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Down flew Anne to the kitchen door. If ever a charitable floor did open\n",
      "to swallow up a miserable, befeathered damsel the Green Gables porch\n",
      "floor should promptly have engulfed Anne at that moment. On the doorstep\n",
      "were standing Priscilla Grant, golden and fair in silk attire, a short,\n",
      "stout gray-haired lady in a tweed suit, and another lady, tall\n",
      "stately, wonderfully gowned, with a beautiful, highbred face and large,\n",
      "black-lashed violet eyes, whom Anne \"instinctively felt,\" as she would\n",
      "have said in her earlier days, to be Mrs. Charlotte E. Morgan.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the dismay of the moment one thought stood out from the confusion of\n",
      "Anne's mind and she grasped at it as at the proverbial straw. All Mrs.\n",
      "Morgan's heroines were noted for \"rising to the occasion.\" No matter\n",
      "what their troubles were, they invariably rose to the occasion and\n",
      "showed their superiority over all ills of time, space, and quantity.\n",
      "Anne therefore felt it was HER duty to rise to the occasion and she did\n",
      "it, so perfectly that Priscilla afterward declared she never admired\n",
      "Anne Shirley more than at that moment. No matter what her outraged\n",
      "feelings were she did not show them. She greeted Priscilla and was\n",
      "introduced to her companions as calmly and composedly as if she had been\n",
      "arrayed in purple and fine linen. To be sure, it was somewhat of a shock\n",
      "to find that the lady she had instinctively felt to be Mrs. Morgan was\n",
      "not Mrs. Morgan at all, but an unknown Mrs. Pendexter, while the stout\n",
      "little gray-haired woman was Mrs. Morgan; but in the greater shock the\n",
      "lesser lost its power. Anne ushered her guests to the spare room and\n",
      "thence into the parlor, where she left them while she hastened out to\n",
      "help Priscilla unharness her horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's dreadful to come upon you so unexpectedly as this,\" apologized\n",
      "Priscilla, \"but I did not know till last night that we were coming. Aunt\n",
      "Charlotte is going away Monday and she had promised to spend today with\n",
      "a friend in town. But last night her friend telephoned to her not to\n",
      "come because they were quarantined for scarlet fever. So I suggested we\n",
      "come here instead, for I knew you were longing to see her. We called\n",
      "at the White Sands Hotel and brought Mrs. Pendexter with us. She is a\n",
      "friend of aunt's and lives in New York and her husband is a millionaire.\n",
      "We can't stay very long, for Mrs. Pendexter has to be back at the hotel\n",
      "by five o'clock.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Several times while they were putting away the horse Anne caught\n",
      "Priscilla looking at her in a furtive, puzzled way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She needn't stare at me so,\" Anne thought a little resentfully. \"If she\n",
      "doesn't KNOW what it is to change a feather bed she might IMAGINE it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When Priscilla had gone to the parlor, and before Anne could escape\n",
      "upstairs, Diana walked into the kitchen. Anne caught her astonished\n",
      "friend by the arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Diana Barry, who do you suppose is in that parlor at this very moment?\n",
      "Mrs. Charlotte E. Morgan . . . and a New York millionaire's wife . . . and\n",
      "here I am like THIS . . . and NOT A THING IN THE HOUSE FOR DINNER BUT A\n",
      "COLD HAM BONE, Diana!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time Anne had become aware that Diana was staring at her in\n",
      "precisely the same bewildered fashion as Priscilla had done. It was\n",
      "really too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Diana, don't look at me so,\" she implored. \"YOU, at least, must\n",
      "know that the neatest person in the world couldn't empty feathers from\n",
      "one tick into another and remain neat in the process.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It . . . it . . . isn't the feathers,\" hesitated Diana. \"It's . . .\n",
      "it's . . . your nose, Anne.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My nose? Oh, Diana, surely nothing has gone wrong with it!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne rushed to the little looking glass over the sink. One glance\n",
      "revealed the fatal truth. Her nose was a brilliant scarlet!\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne sat down on the sofa, her dauntless spirit subdued at last.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is the matter with it?\" asked Diana, curiosity overcoming\n",
      "delicacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought I was rubbing my freckle lotion on it, but I must have used\n",
      "that red dye Marilla has for marking the pattern on her rugs,\" was the\n",
      "despairing response. \"What shall I do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wash it off,\" said Diana practically.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps it won't wash off. First I dye my hair; then I dye my nose.\n",
      "Marilla cut my hair off when I dyed it but that remedy would hardly be\n",
      "practicable in this case. Well, this is another punishment for vanity\n",
      "and I suppose I deserve it . . . though there's not much comfort in THAT.\n",
      "It is really almost enough to make one believe in ill-luck, though Mrs.\n",
      "Lynde says there is no such thing, because everything is foreordained.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately the dye washed off easily and Anne, somewhat consoled,\n",
      "betook herself to the east gable while Diana ran home. Presently Anne\n",
      "came down again, clothed and in her right mind. The muslin dress she had\n",
      "fondly hoped to wear was bobbing merrily about on the line outside, so\n",
      "she was forced to content herself with her black lawn. She had the fire\n",
      "on and the tea steeping when Diana returned; the latter wore HER muslin,\n",
      "at least, and carried a covered platter in her hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mother sent you this,\" she said, lifting the cover and displaying a\n",
      "nicely carved and jointed chicken to Anne's greatful eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chicken was supplemented by light new bread, excellent butter and\n",
      "cheese, Marilla's fruit cake and a dish of preserved plums, floating\n",
      "in their golden syrup as in congealed summer sunshine. There was a big\n",
      "bowlful of pink-and-white asters also, by way of decoration; yet the\n",
      "spread seemed very meager beside the elaborate one formerly prepared for\n",
      "Mrs. Morgan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne's hungry guests, however, did not seem to think anything was\n",
      "lacking and they ate the simple viands with apparent enjoyment. But\n",
      "after the first few moments Anne thought no more of what was or was\n",
      "not on her bill of fare. Mrs. Morgan's appearance might be somewhat\n",
      "disappointing, as even her loyal worshippers had been forced to admit to\n",
      "each other; but she proved to be a delightful conversationalist. She had\n",
      "traveled extensively and was an excellent storyteller. She had seen\n",
      "much of men and women, and crystalized her experiences into witty little\n",
      "sentences and epigrams which made her hearers feel as if they were\n",
      "listening to one of the people in clever books. But under all her\n",
      "sparkle there was a strongly felt undercurrent of true, womanly sympathy\n",
      "and kindheartedness which won affection as easily as her brilliancy\n",
      "won admiration. Nor did she monopolize the conversation. She could draw\n",
      "others out as skillfully and fully as she could talk herself, and Anne\n",
      "and Diana found themselves chattering freely to her. Mrs. Pendexter said\n",
      "little; she merely smiled with her lovely eyes and lips, and ate chicken\n",
      "and fruit cake and preserves with such exquisite grace that she conveyed\n",
      "the impression of dining on ambrosia and honeydew. But then, as Anne\n",
      "said to Diana later on, anybody so divinely beautiful as Mrs. Pendexter\n",
      "didn't need to talk; it was enough for her just to LOOK.\n",
      "\n",
      "After dinner they all had a walk through Lover's Lane and Violet Vale\n",
      "and the Birch Path, then back through the Haunted Wood to the Dryad's\n",
      "Bubble, where they sat down and talked for a delightful last half hour.\n",
      "Mrs. Morgan wanted to know how the Haunted Wood came by its name, and\n",
      "laughed until she cried when she heard the story and Anne's dramatic\n",
      "account of a certain memorable walk through it at the witching hour of\n",
      "twilight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It has indeed been a feast of reason and flow of soul, hasn't it?\" said\n",
      "Anne, when her guests had gone and she and Diana were alone again. \"I\n",
      "don't know which I enjoyed more . . . listening to Mrs. Morgan or gazing\n",
      "at Mrs. Pendexter. I believe we had a nicer time than if we'd known they\n",
      "were coming and been cumbered with much serving. You must stay to tea\n",
      "with me, Diana, and we'll talk it all over.\"\n",

      "\"Priscilla says Mrs. Pendexter's husband's sister is married to an\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I daresay even the English earl himself wouldn't have turned up his\n",

      "\n",
      "Anne did not mention the misfortune which had befallen HER nose when\n",
      "she related the day's history to Marilla that evening. But she took the\n",
      "bottle of freckle lotion and emptied it out of the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I shall never try any beautifying messes again,\" she said, darkly\n",

      "School opened and Anne returned to her work, with fewer theories but\n",
      "considerably more experience. She had several new pupils, six- and\n",
      "seven-year-olds just venturing, round-eyed, into a world of wonder.\n",
      "Among them were Davy and Dora. Davy sat with Milty Boulter, who had been\n",
      "going to school for a year and was therefore quite a man of the world.\n",
      "Dora had made a compact at Sunday School the previous Sunday to sit\n",

      "temporarily assigned to Mirabel Cotton, who was ten years old and\n",
      "therefore, in Dora's eyes, one of the \"big girls.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think school is great fun,\" Davy told Marilla when he got home that\n",
      "night. \"You said I'd find it hard to sit still and I did . . .  you mostly\n",
      "do tell the truth, I notice . . . but you can wriggle your legs about\n",
      "under the desk and that helps a lot. It's splendid to have so many boys\n",
      "to play with. I sit with Milty Boulter and he's fine. He's longer than\n",
      "me but I'm wider. It's nicer to sit in the back seats but you can't sit\n",
      "there till your legs grow long enough to touch the floor. Milty drawed a\n",
      "picture of Anne on his slate and it was awful ugly and I told him if he\n",
      "made pictures of Anne like that I'd lick him at recess. I thought first\n",
      "I'd draw one of him and put horns and a tail on it, but I was afraid it\n",
      "would hurt his feelings, and Anne says you should never hurt anyone's\n",
      "feelings. It seems it's dreadful to have your feelings hurt. It's better\n",
      "to knock a boy down than hurt his feelings if you MUST do something.\n",
      "Milty said he wasn't scared of me but he'd just as soon call it somebody\n",
      "else to 'blige me, so he rubbed out Anne's name and printed Barbara\n",
      "Shaw's under it. Milty doesn't like Barbara 'cause she calls him a sweet\n",
      "little boy and once she patted him on his head.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dora said primly that she liked school; but she was very quiet, even\n",
      "for her; and when at twilight Marilla bade her go upstairs to bed she\n",

      "proud of having so many dead relations, and she told me what they all\n",
      "died of, and what they said, and how they looked in their coffins. And\n",
      "Mirabel says one of her uncles was seen walking around the house after\n",

      "It was accordingly arranged that they should walk, and the following\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It's as if the year were kneeling to pray in a vast cathedral full of\n",
      "mellow stained light, isn't it?\" said Anne dreamily. \"It doesn't seem\n",
      "right to hurry through it, does it? It seems irreverent, like running in\n",
      "a church.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We MUST hurry though,\" said Diana, glancing at her watch. \"We've left\n",

      "her pace. \"I just want to drink the day's loveliness in . . . I feel as if\n",
      "she were holding it out to my lips like a cup of airy wine and I'll take\n",
      "a sip at every step.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps it was because she was so absorbed in \"drinking it in\" that Anne\n",
      "took the left turning when they came to a fork in the road. She should\n",
      "have taken the right, but ever afterward she counted it the most\n",
      "fortunate mistake of her life. They came out finally to a lonely, grassy\n",
      "road, with nothing in sight along it but ranks of spruce saplings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, where are we?\" exclaimed Diana in bewilderment. \"This isn't the\n",
      "West Grafton road.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, it's the base line road in Middle Grafton,\" said Anne, rather\n",
      "shamefacedly. \"I must have taken the wrong turning at the fork. I\n",
      "don't know where we are exactly, but we must be all of three miles from\n",
      "Kimballs' still.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then we can't get there by five, for it's half past four now,\" said\n",

      "have had their tea, and they'll have all the bother of getting ours over\n",
      "again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We'd better turn back and go home,\" suggested Anne humbly. But Diana,\n",
      "after consideration, vetoed this.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, we may as well go and spend the evening, since we have come this\n",
      "far.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I don't know and we can't afford to make any more mistakes. Here is a\n",
      "gate and a lane leading right into the wood. There must be a house at\n",
      "the other side. Let us go down and inquire.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a romantic old lane this it,\" said Diana, as they walked along its\n",
      "twists and turns. It ran under patriarchal old firs whose branches met\n",
      "above, creating a perpetual gloom in which nothing except moss could\n",
      "grow. On either hand were brown wood floors, crossed here and there\n",
      "by fallen lances of sunlight. All was very still and remote, as if the\n",
      "world and the cares of the world were far away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I feel as if we were walking through an enchanted forest,\" said Anne in\n",
      "a hushed tone. \"Do you suppose we'll ever find our way back to the\n",
      "real world again, Diana? We shall presently come to a palace with a\n",
      "spellbound princess in it, I think.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Around the next turn they came in sight, not indeed of a palace, but of\n",
      "a little house almost as surprising as a palace would have been in this\n",
      "province of conventional wooden farmhouses, all as much alike in general\n",
      "characteristics as if they had grown from the same seed. Anne stopped\n",
      "short in rapture and Diana exclaimed, \"Oh, I know where we are now.\n",
      "That is the little stone house where Miss Lavendar Lewis lives . . . Echo\n",

      "multitude of fairy echoes, sweet, elusive, silvery, as if all the \"horns\n",
      "of elfland\" were blowing against the sunset. Anne and Diana exclaimed in\n",
      "delight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now laugh, Charlotta . . . laugh loudly.\"\n",

      "Charlotta, who would probably have obeyed if Miss Lavendar had told her\n",

      "points.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"People always admire my echoes very much,\" said Miss Lavendar, as if\n",

      "them. Charlotta, take back the horn and hang it carefully in its place.\"\n",

      "\"Why do you call her Charlotta the Fourth?\" asked Diana, who was\n",
      "bursting with curiosity on this point.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just to keep her from getting mixed up with other Charlottas in my\n",
      "thoughts,\" said Miss Lavendar seriously. \"They all look so much alike\n",
      "there's no telling them apart. Her name isn't really Charlotta at all.\n",
      "It is . . . let me see . . . what is it? I THINK it's Leonora . . . yes, it\n",
      "IS Leonora. You see, it is this way. When mother died ten years ago I\n",
      "couldn't stay here alone . . .  and I couldn't afford to pay the wages of\n",
      "a grown-up girl. So I got little Charlotta Bowman to come and stay with\n",
      "me for board and clothes. Her name really was Charlotta . . . she was\n",
      "Charlotta the First. She was just thirteen. She stayed with me till\n",
      "she was sixteen and then she went away to Boston, because she could\n",
      "do better there. Her sister came to stay with me then. Her name was\n",
      "Julietta . . . Mrs. Bowman had a weakness for fancy names I think . . .\n",
      "but she looked so like Charlotta that I kept calling her that all the\n",
      "time . . .and she didn't mind. So I just gave up trying to remember her\n",
      "right name. She was Charlotta the Second, and when she went away Evelina\n",
      "came and she was Charlotta the Third. Now I have Charlotta the Fourth;\n",
      "but when she is sixteen . . . she's fourteen now . . .  she will want to\n",
      "go to Boston too, and what I shall do then I really do not know.\n",
      "Charlotta the Fourth is the last of the Bowman girls, and the best. The\n",
      "other Charlottas always let me see that they thought it silly of me to\n",
      "pretend things but Charlotta the Fourth never does, no matter what she\n",
      "may really think. I don't care what people think about me if they don't\n",
      "let me see it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Diana looking regretfully at the setting sun. \"I suppose\n",

      "Gables.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Paul Irving?\" There was a subtle change in Miss Lavendar's voice. \"Who\n",
      "is he? I didn't think there was anybody of that name in Avonlea.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne felt vexed at her own heedlessness. She had forgotten about Miss\n",
      "Lavendar's old romance when Paul's name slipped out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is a little pupil of mine,\" she explained slowly. \"He came from\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Is he Stephen Irving's son?\" Miss Lavendar asked, bending over her\n",

      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm going to give you girls a bunch of lavendar apiece,\" said Miss\n",

      "\"It's very sweet, don't you think? Mother always loved it. She planted\n",
      "these borders long ago. Father named me Lavendar because he was so fond\n",
      "of it. The very first time he saw mother was when he visited her home in\n",
      "East Grafton with her brother. He fell in love with her at first sight;\n",
      "and they put him in the spare room bed to sleep and the sheets were\n",
      "scented with lavendar and he lay awake all night and thought of her. He\n",
      "always loved the scent of lavendar after that . . . and that was why he\n",

      "looking for you, Charlotta the Fourth and I.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She opened the gate under the firs for them to pass through. She looked\n",
      "suddenly old and tired; the glow and radiance had faded from her face;\n",
      "her parting smile was as sweet with ineradicable youth as ever, but\n",
      "when the girls looked back from the first curve in the lane they saw her\n",
      "sitting on the old stone bench under the silver poplar in the middle of\n",
      "the garden with her head leaning wearily on her hand.\n",

      "her Elizabeth or Nellie or Muriel she must have been called\n",
      "Lavendar just the same, I think. It's so suggestive of sweetness and\n",
      "old-fashioned graces and 'silk attire.' Now, my name just smacks of\n",
      "bread and butter, patchwork and chores.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I don't think so,\" said Diana. \"Anne seems to me real stately and\n",

      "\"So you had tea at the stone house with Lavendar Lewis?\" said Marilla\n",
      "at the breakfast table next morning. \"What is she like now? It's over\n",
      "fifteen years since I saw her last . . . it was one Sunday in Grafton\n",
      "church. I suppose she has changed a great deal. Davy Keith, when you\n",
      "want something you can't reach, ask to have it passed and don't spread\n",
      "yourself over the table in that fashion. Did you ever see Paul Irving\n",
      "doing that when he was here to meals?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But Paul's arms are longer'n mine,\" brumbled Davy. \"They've had eleven\n",
      "years to grow and mine've only had seven. 'Sides, I DID ask, but you\n",
      "and Anne was so busy talking you didn't pay any 'tention. 'Sides, Paul's\n",
      "never been here to any meal escept tea, and it's easier to be p'lite\n",
      "at tea than at breakfast. You ain't half as hungry. It's an awful long\n",
      "while between supper and breakfast. Now, Anne, that spoonful ain't any\n",
      "bigger than it was last year and I'M ever so much bigger.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course, I don't know what Miss Lavendar used to look like but I\n",
      "don't fancy somehow that she has changed a great deal,\" said Anne, after\n",
      "she had helped Davy to maple syrup, giving him two spoonfuls to pacify\n",
      "him. \"Her hair is snow-white but her face is fresh and almost girlish,\n",
      "and she has the sweetest brown eyes . . . such a pretty shade of\n",
      "wood-brown with little golden glints in them . . .  and her voice makes\n",
      "you think of white satin and tinkling water and fairy bells all mixed up\n",
      "together.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She was reckoned a great beauty when she was a girl,\" said Marilla. \"I\n",
      "never knew her very well but I liked her as far as I did know her. Some\n",
      "folks thought her peculiar even then. DAVY, if ever I catch you at such\n",
      "a trick again you'll be made to wait for your meals till everyone else\n",
      "is done, like the French.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Most conversations between Anne and Marilla in the presence of the\n",
      "twins, were punctuated by these rebukes Davy-ward. In this instance,\n",
      "Davy, sad to relate, not being able to scoop up the last drops of his\n",
      "syrup with his spoon, had solved the difficulty by lifting his plate in\n",
      "both hands and applying his small pink tongue to it. Anne looked at him\n",
      "with such horrified eyes that the little sinner turned red and said,\n",
      "half shamefacedly, half defiantly,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There ain't any wasted that way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"People who are different from other people are always called peculiar,\"\n",
      "said Anne. \"And Miss Lavendar is certainly different, though it's hard\n",
      "to say just where the difference comes in. Perhaps it is because she is\n",
      "one of those people who never grow old.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One might as well grow old when all your generation do,\" said Marilla,\n",
      "rather reckless of her pronouns. \"If you don't, you don't fit in\n",
      "anywhere. Far as I can learn Lavendar Lewis has just dropped out of\n",
      "everything. She's lived in that out of the way place until everybody has\n",
      "forgotten her. That stone house is one of the oldest on the Island. Old\n",
      "Mr. Lewis built it eighty years ago when he came out from England.\n",
      "Davy, stop joggling Dora's elbow. Oh, I saw you! You needn't try to look\n",
      "innocent. What does make you behave so this morning?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Maybe I got out of the wrong side of the bed,\" suggested Davy. \"Milty\n",
      "Boulter says if you do that things are bound to go wrong with you all\n",
      "day. His grandmother told him. But which is the right side? And what are\n",
      "you to do when your bed's against the wall? I want to know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've always wondered what went wrong between Stephen Irving and\n",
      "Lavendar Lewis,\" continued Marilla, ignoring Davy. \"They were certainly\n",
      "engaged twenty-five years ago and then all at once it was broken off.\n",
      "I don't know what the trouble was but it must have been something\n",
      "terrible, for he went away to the States and never come home since.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps it was nothing very dreadful after all. I think the little\n",
      "things in life often make more trouble than the big things,\" said Anne,\n",
      "with one of those flashes of insight which experience could not have\n",
      "bettered. \"Marilla, please don't say anything about my being at Miss\n",
      "Lavendar's to Mrs. Lynde. She'd be sure to ask a hundred questions and\n",
      "somehow I wouldn't like it . . . nor Miss Lavendar either if she knew, I\n",
      "feel sure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I daresay Rachel would be curious,\" admitted Marilla, \"though she\n",
      "hasn't as much time as she used to have for looking after other people's\n",
      "affairs. She's tied home now on account of Thomas; and she's feeling\n",
      "pretty downhearted, for I think she's beginning to lose hope of his ever\n",
      "getting better. Rachel will be left pretty lonely if anything happens to\n",
      "him, with all her children settled out west, except Eliza in town; and\n",
      "she doesn't like her husband.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marilla's pronouns slandered Eliza, who was very fond of her husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Rachel says if he'd only brace up and exert his will power he'd get\n",
      "better. But what is the use of asking a jellyfish to sit up straight?\"\n",
      "continued Marilla. \"Thomas Lynde never had any will power to exert. His\n",
      "mother ruled him till he married and then Rachel carried it on. It's a\n",
      "wonder he dared to get sick without asking her permission. But there, I\n",
      "shouldn't talk so. Rachel has been a good wife to him. He'd never have\n",
      "amounted to anything without her, that's certain. He was born to be\n",
      "ruled; and it's well he fell into the hands of a clever, capable manager\n",
      "like Rachel. He didn't mind her way. It saved him the bother of ever\n",
      "making up his own mind about anything. Davy, do stop squirming like an\n",
      "eel.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've nothing else to do,\" protested Davy. \"I can't eat any more, and\n",
      "it's no fun watching you and Anne eat.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, you and Dora go out and give the hens their wheat,\" said Marilla.\n",
      "\"And don't you try to pull any more feathers out of the white rooster's\n",
      "tail either.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wanted some feathers for an Injun headdress,\" said Davy sulkily.\n",
      "\"Milty Boulter has a dandy one, made out of the feathers his mother give\n",
      "him when she killed their old white gobbler. You might let me have some.\n",
      "That rooster's got ever so many more'n he wants.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may have the old feather duster in the garret,\" said Anne, \"and\n",
      "I'll dye them green and red and yellow for you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You do spoil that boy dreadfully,\" said Marilla, when Davy, with a\n",
      "radiant face, had followed prim Dora out. Marilla's education had made\n",
      "great strides in the past six years; but she had not yet been able to\n",
      "rid herself of the idea that it was very bad for a child to have too\n",
      "many of its wishes indulged.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All the boys of his class have Indian headdresses, and Davy wants one\n",
      "too,\" said Anne. \"_I_ know how it feels . . . I'll never forget how I used\n",
      "to long for puffed sleeves when all the other girls had them. And Davy\n",
      "isn't being spoiled. He is improving every day. Think what a difference\n",
      "there is in him since he came here a year ago.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He certainly doesn't get into as much mischief since he began to go to\n",
      "school,\" acknowledged Marilla. \"I suppose he works off the tendency with\n",
      "the other boys. But it's a wonder to me we haven't heard from Richard\n",
      "Keith before this. Never a word since last May.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll be afraid to hear from him,\" sighed Anne, beginning to clear away\n",
      "the dishes. \"If a letter should come I'd dread opening it, for fear it\n",
      "would tell us to send the twins to him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A month later a letter did come. But it was not from Richard Keith. A\n",
      "friend of his wrote to say that Richard Keith had died of consumption a\n",
      "fortnight previously. The writer of the letter was the executor of his\n",
      "will and by that will the sum of two thousand dollars was left to Miss\n",
      "Marilla Cuthbert in trust for David and Dora Keith until they came of\n",
      "age or married. In the meantime the interest was to be used for their\n",
      "maintenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It seems dreadful to be glad of anything in connection with a death,\"\n",
      "said Anne soberly. \"I'm sorry for poor Mr. Keith; but I AM glad that we\n",
      "can keep the twins.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a very good thing about the money,\" said Marilla practically. \"I\n",
      "wanted to keep them but I really didn't see how I could afford to do\n",
      "it, especially when they grew older. The rent of the farm doesn't do any\n",
      "more than keep the house and I was bound that not a cent of your money\n",
      "should be spent on them. You do far too much for them as it is. Dora\n",
      "didn't need that new hat you bought her any more than a cat needs two\n",
      "tails. But now the way is made clear and they are provided for.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Davy and Dora were delighted when they heard that they were to live at\n",

      "Anne had paid many a visit to Echo Lodge since that October day.\n",
      "Sometimes she and Diana drove around by the road; sometimes they walked\n",

      "her and Miss Lavendar had sprung up one of those fervent, helpful\n",
      "friendships possible only between a woman who has kept the freshness of\n",
      "youth in her heart and soul, and a girl whose imagination and intuition\n",
      "supplied the place of experience. Anne had at last discovered a real\n",
      "\"kindred spirit,\" while into the little lady's lonely, sequestered life\n",
      "of dreams Anne and Diana came with the wholesome joy and exhilaration of\n",
      "the outer existence, which Miss Lavendar, \"the world forgetting, by the\n",
      "world forgot,\" had long ceased to share; they brought an atmosphere of\n",
      "youth and reality to the little stone house. Charlotta the Fourth always\n",
      "greeted them with her very widest smile . . . and Charlotta's smiles WERE\n",
      "fearfully wide . . . loving them for the sake of her adored mistress as\n",
      "well as for their own. Never had there been such \"high jinks\" held in\n",
      "the little stone house as were held there that beautiful, late-lingering\n",
      "autumn, when November seemed October over again, and even December aped\n",

      "But on this particular day it seemed as if December had remembered that\n",
      "it was time for winter and had turned suddenly dull and brooding, with\n",
      "a windless hush predictive of coming snow. Nevertheless, Anne keenly\n",
      "enjoyed her walk through the great gray maze of the beechlands; though\n",
      "alone she never found it lonely; her imagination peopled her path\n",
      "with merry companions, and with these she carried on a gay, pretended\n",
      "conversation that was wittier and more fascinating than conversations\n",
      "are apt to be in real life, where people sometimes fail most lamentably\n",
      "to talk up to the requirements. In a \"make believe\" assembly of choice\n",
      "spirits everybody says just the thing you want her to say and so gives\n",
      "you the chance to say just what YOU want to say. Attended by this\n",

      "just as broad, feathery flakes began to flutter down softly.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the first bend she came upon Miss Lavendar, standing under a big,\n",
      "broad-branching fir. She wore a gown of warm, rich red, and her head and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You look like the queen of the fir wood fairies,\" called Anne merrily.\n",

      "been very lonely if you hadn't come . . . even the dreams and the echoes\n",
      "wouldn't have been enough company. Oh, Anne, how pretty you are,\"\n",

      "it. And I can't reconcile myself to it as most women seem to. I'm just\n",
      "as rebellious as I was when I discovered my first gray hair. Now,\n",
      "Anne, don't look as if you were trying to understand. Seventeen CAN'T\n",
      "understand. I'm going to pretend right away that I am seventeen too, and\n",
      "I can do it, now that you're here. You always bring youth in your hand\n",

      "There were sounds of riot and mirth in the little stone house that\n",
      "night. What with cooking and feasting and making candy and laughing and\n",
      "\"pretending,\" it is quite true that Miss Lavendar and Anne comported\n",
      "themselves in a fashion entirely unsuited to the dignity of a spinster\n",
      "of forty-five and a sedate schoolma'am. Then, when they were tired, they\n",
      "sat down on the rug before the grate in the parlor, lighted only by the\n",
      "soft fireshine and perfumed deliciously by Miss Lavendar's open rose-jar\n",
      "on the mantel. The wind had risen and was sighing and wailing around\n",
      "the eaves and the snow was thudding softly against the windows, as if a\n",
      "hundred storm sprites were tapping for entrance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm so glad you're here, Anne,\" said Miss Lavendar, nibbling at her\n",
      "candy. \"If you weren't I should be blue . . . very blue . . .  almost navy\n",
      "blue. Dreams and make-believes are all very well in the daytime and the\n",
      "sunshine, but when dark and storm come they fail to satisfy. One wants\n",
      "real things then. But you don't know this . . . seventeen never knows\n",
      "it. At seventeen dreams DO satisfy because you think the realities are\n",
      "waiting for you further on. When I was seventeen, Anne, I didn't think\n",
      "forty-five would find me a white-haired little old maid with nothing but\n",

      "\n",
      "\"But you aren't an old maid,\" said Anne, smiling into Miss Lavendar's\n",

      "\n",

      "Anne, did anyone ever tell you anything about Stephen Irving and me?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"So we were . . . twenty-five years ago . . . a lifetime ago. And we\n",

      "although nobody but mother and Stephen ever knew THAT. We'd been engaged\n",
      "in a way almost all our lives, you might say. When Stephen was a little\n",

      "the second time he ever came . . .  he was nine and I was six . . . he\n",
      "told me out in the garden that he had pretty well made up his mind to\n",
      "marry me when he grew up. I remember that I said 'Thank you'; and when\n",
      "he was gone I told mother very gravely that there was a great weight off\n",
      "my mind, because I wasn't frightened any more about having to be an old\n",
      "maid. How poor mother laughed!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And what went wrong?\" asked Anne breathlessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We had just a stupid, silly, commonplace quarrel. So commonplace that,\n",
      "if you'll believe me, I don't even remember just how it began. I hardly\n",
      "know who was the more to blame for it. Stephen did really begin it, but\n",
      "I suppose I provoked him by some foolishness of mine. He had a rival or\n",
      "two, you see. I was vain and coquettish and liked to tease him a little.\n",
      "He was a very high-strung, sensitive fellow. Well, we parted in a temper\n",
      "on both sides. But I thought it would all come right; and it would have\n",
      "if Stephen hadn't come back too soon. Anne, my dear, I'm sorry to say\"\n",
      ". . . Miss Lavendar dropped her voice as if she were about to confess a\n",
      "predilection for murdering people, \"that I am a dreadfully sulky person.\n",
      "Oh, you needn't smile, . . .  it's only too true. I DO sulk; and Stephen\n",
      "came back before I had finished sulking. I wouldn't listen to him and I\n",
      "wouldn't forgive him; and so he went away for good. He was too proud to\n",
      "come again. And then I sulked because he didn't come. I might have sent\n",
      "for him perhaps, but I couldn't humble myself to do that. I was just\n",
      "as proud as he was . . . pride and sulkiness make a very bad combination,\n",
      "Anne. But I could never care for anybody else and I didn't want to.\n",
      "I knew I would rather be an old maid for a thousand years than marry\n",
      "anybody who wasn't Stephen Irving. Well, it all seems like a dream now,\n",
      "of course. How sympathetic you look, Anne . . . as sympathetic as only\n",
      "seventeen can look. But don't overdo it. I'm really a very happy,\n",
      "contented little person in spite of my broken heart. My heart did break,\n",
      "if ever a heart did, when I realized that Stephen Irving was not coming\n",

      "She saw that Miss Lavendar and Paul had \"taken\" to each other, and that\n",
      "there would be no constraint or stiffness. Miss Lavendar was a very\n",
      "sensible person, in spite of her dreams and romance, and after\n",
      "that first little betrayal she tucked her feelings out of sight and\n",
      "entertained Paul as brightly and naturally as if he were anybody's son\n",
      "who had come to see her. They all had a jolly afternoon together and\n",
      "such a feast of fat things by way of supper as would have made old Mrs.\n",

      "edges showed a ghastly, livid white. There was something about it\n",
      "indescribably menacing as it gloomed up in the clear blue sky; now and\n",
      "again a bolt of lightning shot across it, followed by a savage growl. It\n",
      "hung so low that it almost seemed to be touching the tops of the wooded\n",
      "hills.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Harmon Andrews came clattering up the hill in his truck wagon,\n",

      "\"Guess Uncle Abe's hit it for once in his life, Anne,\" he shouted. \"His\n",

      "were joined at the door by Marilla, who had been hustling her ducks and\n",
      "chickens under shelter. As they dashed into the kitchen the light seemed\n",
      "to vanish, as if blown out by some mighty breath; the awful cloud rolled\n",
      "over the sun and a darkness as of late twilight fell across the world.\n",
      "At the same moment, with a crash of thunder and a blinding glare of\n",
      "lightning, the hail swooped down and blotted the landscape out in one\n",
      "white fury.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through all the clamor of the storm came the thud of torn branches\n",
      "striking the house and the sharp crack of breaking glass. In three\n",
      "minutes every pane in the west and north windows was broken and the\n",
      "hail poured in through the apertures covering the floor with stones, the\n",
      "smallest of which was as big as a hen's egg. For three quarters of an\n",
      "hour the storm raged unabated and no one who underwent it ever forgot\n",
      "it. Marilla, for once in her life shaken out of her composure by sheer\n",
      "terror, knelt by her rocking chair in a corner of the kitchen, gasping\n",
      "and sobbing between the deafening thunder peals. Anne, white as paper,\n",
      "had dragged the sofa away from the window and sat on it with a twin on\n",
      "either side. Davy at the first crash had howled, \"Anne, Anne, is it the\n",
      "Judgment Day? Anne, Anne, I never meant to be naughty,\" and then\n",
      "had buried his face in Anne's lap and kept it there, his little body\n",
      "quivering. Dora, somewhat pale but quite composed, sat with her hand\n",
      "clasped in Anne's, quiet and motionless. It is doubtful if an earthquake\n",

      "Then, almost as suddenly as it began, the storm ceased. The hail\n",

      "an absurd thing to think that a scant three quarters of an hour could\n",
      "have effected such a transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marilla rose from her knees, weak and trembling, and dropped on her\n",
      "rocker. Her face was haggard and she looked ten years older.\n",

      "\"Have we all come out of that alive?\" she asked solemnly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You bet we have,\" piped Davy cheerfully, quite his own man again. \"I\n",

      "Far and wide was a white carpet, knee deep, of hailstones; drifts of\n",

      "four days later, those hailstones melted, the havoc they had wrought was\n",
      "plainly seen, for every green growing thing in the field or garden was\n",
      "cut off. Not only was every blossom stripped from the apple trees but\n",
      "great boughs and branches were wrenched away. And out of the two hundred\n",

      "off or torn to shreds.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The like of this has never been known in Prince Edward Island,\" said\n",

      "sure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I do hope none of the children were caught out in it,\" murmured Anne\n",
      "anxiously. As it was discovered later, none of the children had been,\n",
      "since all those who had any distance to go had taken Mr. Andrews'\n",
      "excellent advice and sought refuge at the post office.\n",

      "\n",

      "going to say something sympathetic as soon as I stop talking . . . but\n",
      "don't. If you did I'd cry like a baby. Hasn't this been a terrible\n",

      "One blithe June morning, a fortnight after Uncle Abe's storm, Anne came\n",
      "slowly through the Green Gables yard from the garden, carrying in her\n",
      "hands two blighted stalks of white narcissus.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look, Marilla,\" she said sorrowfully, holding up the flowers before the\n",
      "eyes of a grim lady, with her hair coifed in a green gingham apron, who\n",
      "was going into the house with a plucked chicken, \"these are the only\n",
      "buds the storm spared . . . and even they are imperfect. I'm so sorry\n",
      ". . . I wanted some for Matthew's grave. He was always so fond of June\n",
      "lilies.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I kind of miss them myself,\" admitted Marilla, \"though it doesn't seem\n",
      "right to lament over them when so many worse things have happened. . .\n",
      "all the crops destroyed as well as the fruit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But people have sown their oats over again,\" said Anne comfortingly,\n",
      "\"and Mr. Harrison says he thinks if we have a good summer they will come\n",
      "out all right though late. And my annuals are all coming up again . . .\n",
      "but oh, nothing can replace the June lilies. Poor little Hester Gray\n",
      "will have none either. I went all the way back to her garden last night\n",
      "but there wasn't one. I'm sure she'll miss them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think it's right for you to say such things, Anne, I really\n",
      "don't,\" said Marilla severely. \"Hester Gray has been dead for thirty\n",
      "years and her spirit is in heaven . . . I hope.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but I believe she loves and remembers her garden here still,\" said\n",
      "Anne. \"I'm sure no matter how long I'd lived in heaven I'd like to look\n",
      "down and see somebody putting flowers on my grave. If I had had a garden\n",
      "here like Hester Gray's it would take me more than thirty years, even in\n",
      "heaven, to forget being homesick for it by spells.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, don't let the twins hear you talking like that,\" was Marilla's\n",
      "feeble protest, as she carried her chicken into the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne pinned her narcissi on her hair and went to the lane gate, where\n",
      "she stood for awhile sunning herself in the June brightness before\n",
      "going in to attend to her Saturday morning duties. The world was growing\n",
      "lovely again; old Mother Nature was doing her best to remove the traces\n",
      "of the storm, and, though she was not to succeed fully for many a moon,\n",
      "she was really accomplishing wonders.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish I could just be idle all day today,\" Anne told a bluebird, who\n",

      "also helping to bring up twins, can't indulge in laziness, birdie. How\n",
      "sweet you are singing, little bird. You are just putting the feelings of\n",

      "coming?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "An express wagon was jolting up the lane, with two people on the front\n",
      "seat and a big trunk behind. When it drew near Anne recognized the\n",
      "driver as the son of the station agent at Bright River; but his\n",
      "companion was a stranger . . . a scrap of a woman who sprang nimbly down\n",
      "at the gate almost before the horse came to a standstill. She was a very\n",
      "pretty little person, evidently nearer fifty than forty, but with rosy\n",
      "cheeks, sparkling black eyes, and shining black hair, surmounted by\n",
      "a wonderful beflowered and beplumed bonnet. In spite of having driven\n",
      "eight miles over a dusty road she was as neat as if she had just stepped\n",
      "out of the proverbial bandbox.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is this where Mr. James A. Harrison lives?\" she inquired briskly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, Mr. Harrison lives over there,\" said Anne, quite lost in\n",
      "astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I DID think this place seemed too tidy . . . MUCH too tidy for\n",
      "James A. to be living here, unless he has greatly changed since I knew\n",
      "him,\" chirped the little lady. \"Is it true that James A. is going to be\n",
      "married to some woman living in this settlement?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, oh no,\" cried Anne, flushing so guiltily that the stranger looked\n",
      "curiously at her, as if she half suspected her of matrimonial designs on\n",
      "Mr. Harrison.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I saw it in an Island paper,\" persisted the Fair Unknown. \"A friend\n",
      "sent a marked copy to me . . . friends are always so ready to do such\n",
      "things. James A.'s name was written in over 'new citizen.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, that note was only meant as a joke,\" gasped Anne. \"Mr. Harrison has\n",
      "no intention of marrying ANYBODY. I assure you he hasn't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm very glad to hear it,\" said the rosy lady, climbing nimbly back to\n",
      "her seat in the wagon, \"because he happens to be married already. _I_\n",
      "am his wife. Oh, you may well look surprised. I suppose he has been\n",
      "masquerading as a bachelor and breaking hearts right and left. Well,\n",
      "well, James A.,\" nodding vigorously over the fields at the long white\n",
      "house, \"your fun is over. I am here . . . though I wouldn't have bothered\n",
      "coming if I hadn't thought you were up to some mischief. I suppose,\"\n",
      "turning to Anne, \"that parrot of his is as profane as ever?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"His parrot . . . is dead . . . I THINK,\" gasped poor Anne, who couldn't\n",
      "have felt sure of her own name at that precise moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dead! Everything will be all right then,\" cried the rosy lady\n",
      "jubilantly. \"I can manage James A. if that bird is out of the way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With which cryptic utterance she went joyfully on her way and Anne flew\n",
      "to the kitchen door to meet Marilla.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anne, who was that woman?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Marilla,\" said Anne solemnly, but with dancing eyes, \"do I look as if I\n",
      "were crazy?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not more so than usual,\" said Marilla, with no thought of being\n",
      "sarcastic.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well then, do you think I am awake?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Anne, what nonsense has got into you? Who was that woman, I say?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Marilla, if I'm not crazy and not asleep she can't be such stuff as\n",
      "dreams are made of . . . she must be real. Anyway, I'm sure I couldn't\n",
      "have imagined such a bonnet. She says she is Mr. Harrison's wife,\n",
      "Marilla.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marilla stared in her turn.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"His wife! Anne Shirley! Then what has he been passing himself off as an\n",
      "unmarried man for?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't suppose he did, really,\" said Anne, trying to be just. \"He\n",
      "never said he wasn't married. People simply took it for granted. Oh\n",
      "Marilla, what will Mrs. Lynde say to this?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They found out what Mrs. Lynde had to say when she came up that evening.\n",
      "Mrs. Lynde wasn't surprised! Mrs. Lynde had always expected something\n",
      "of the sort! Mrs. Lynde had always known there was SOMETHING about Mr.\n",
      "Harrison!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To think of his deserting his wife!\" she said indignantly. \"It's like\n",
      "something you'd read of in the States, but who would expect such a thing\n",
      "to happen right here in Avonlea?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But we don't know that he deserted her,\" protested Anne, determined to\n",
      "believe her friend innocent till he was proved guilty. \"We don't know\n",
      "the rights of it at all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, we soon will. I'm going straight over there,\" said Mrs. Lynde,\n",
      "who had never learned that there was such a word as delicacy in the\n",
      "dictionary. \"I'm not supposed to know anything about her arrival, and\n",
      "Mr. Harrison was to bring some medicine for Thomas from Carmody today,\n",
      "so that will be a good excuse. I'll find out the whole story and come in\n",
      "and tell you on the way back.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Lynde rushed in where Anne had feared to tread. Nothing would have\n",
      "induced the latter to go over to the Harrison place; but she had her\n",
      "natural and proper share of curiosity and she felt secretly glad that\n",
      "Mrs. Lynde was going to solve the mystery. She and Marilla waited\n",
      "expectantly for that good lady's return, but waited in vain. Mrs. Lynde\n",
      "did not revisit Green Gables that night. Davy, arriving home at nine\n",
      "o'clock from the Boulter place, explained why.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I met Mrs. Lynde and some strange woman in the Hollow,\" he said, \"and\n",
      "gracious, how they were talking both at once! Mrs. Lynde said to tell\n",
      "you she was sorry it was too late to call tonight. Anne, I'm awful\n",
      "hungry. We had tea at Milty's at four and I think Mrs. Boulter is real\n",
      "mean. She didn't give us any preserves or cake  . . . and even the bread\n",
      "was skurce.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Davy, when you go visiting you must never criticize anything you are\n",
      "given to eat,\" said Anne solemnly. \"It is very bad manners.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right . . . I'll only think it,\" said Davy cheerfully. \"Do give a\n",
      "fellow some supper, Anne.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne looked at Marilla, who followed her into the pantry and shut the\n",
      "door cautiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can give him some jam on his bread, I know what tea at Levi\n",
      "Boulter's is apt to be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Davy took his slice of bread and jam with a sigh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a kind of disappointing world after all,\" he remarked. \"Milty has\n",
      "a cat that takes fits . . . she's took a fit regular every day for three\n",
      "weeks. Milty says it's awful fun to watch her. I went down today on\n",
      "purpose to see her have one but the mean old thing wouldn't take a fit\n",
      "and just kept healthy as healthy, though Milty and me hung round all\n",
      "the afternoon and waited. But never mind\"  . . . Davy brightened up as the\n",
      "insidious comfort of the plum jam stole into his soul . . . \"maybe I'll\n",
      "see her in one sometime yet. It doesn't seem likely she'd stop having\n",
      "them all at once when she's been so in the habit of it, does it? This\n",
      "jam is awful nice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Davy had no sorrows that plum jam could not cure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sunday proved so rainy that there was no stirring abroad; but by Monday\n",
      "everybody had heard some version of the Harrison story. The school\n",
      "buzzed with it and Davy came home, full of information.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Marilla, Mr. Harrison has a new wife . . . well, not ezackly new, but\n",
      "they've stopped being married for quite a spell, Milty says. I always\n",
      "s'posed people had to keep on being married once they'd begun, but Milty\n",
      "says no, there's ways of stopping if you can't agree. Milty says one way\n",
      "is just to start off and leave your wife, and that's what Mr. Harrison\n",
      "did. Milty says Mr. Harrison left his wife because she throwed things at\n",
      "him . . . HARD things . . . and Arty Sloane says it was because she\n",
      "wouldn't let him smoke, and Ned Clay says it was 'cause she never let up\n",
      "scolding him. I wouldn't leave MY wife for anything like that. I'd just\n",
      "put my foot down and say, 'Mrs. Davy, you've just got to do what'll\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Mrs. Harrison was away . . . she's gone to Carmody with Mrs. Rachel Lynde\n",
      "to get new paper for the parlor. And Mr. Harrison said to tell Anne to\n",
      "go over and see him 'cause he wants to have a talk with her. And say,\n",
      "the floor is scrubbed, and Mr. Harrison is shaved, though there wasn't\n",
      "any preaching yesterday.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Harrison kitchen wore a very unfamiliar look to Anne. The floor was\n",
      "indeed scrubbed to a wonderful pitch of purity and so was every article\n",
      "of furniture in the room; the stove was polished until she could see her\n",
      "face in it; the walls were whitewashed and the window panes sparkled\n",
      "in the sunlight. By the table sat Mr. Harrison in his working clothes,\n",
      "which on Friday had been noted for sundry rents and tatters but which\n",
      "were now neatly patched and brushed. He was sprucely shaved and what\n",
      "little hair he had was carefully trimmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sit down, Anne, sit down,\" said Mr. Harrison in a tone but two degrees\n",
      "removed from that which Avonlea people used at funerals. \"Emily's\n",
      "gone over to Carmody with Rachel Lynde . . . she's struck up a lifelong\n",
      "friendship already with Rachel Lynde. Beats all how contrary women\n",
      "are. Well, Anne, my easy times are over . . . all over. It's neatness and\n",
      "tidiness for me for the rest of my natural life, I suppose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Harrison did his best to speak dolefully, but an irrepressible\n",
      "twinkle in his eye betrayed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mr. Harrison, you are glad your wife is come back,\" cried Anne, shaking\n",
      "her finger at him. \"You needn't pretend you're not, because I can see it\n",

      "Mr. Harrison relaxed into a sheepish smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well . . . well . . . I'm getting used to it,\" he conceded. \"I can't say\n",
      "I was sorry to see Emily. A man really needs some protection in a\n",
      "community like this, where he can't play a game of checkers with a\n",
      "neighbor without being accused of wanting to marry that neighbor's\n",
      "sister and having it put in the paper.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I didn't pretend I was. If anybody'd have asked me if I was married I'd\n",
      "have said I was. But they just took it for granted. I wasn't anxious to\n",
      "talk about the matter . . . I was feeling too sore over it. It would have\n",

      "\n",
      "\"But some people say that you left her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She started it, Anne, she started it. I'm going to tell you the whole\n",
      "story, for I don't want you to think worse of me than I deserve . . . nor\n",
      "of Emily neither. But let's go out on the veranda. Everything is so\n",
      "fearful neat in here that it kind of makes me homesick. I suppose I'll\n",
      "get used to it after awhile but it eases me up to look at the yard.\n",
      "Emily hasn't had time to tidy it up yet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as they were comfortably seated on the veranda Mr. Harrison\n",

      "\"I lived in Scottsford, New Brunswick, before I came here, Anne. My\n",

      "tidy and she let me alone and spoiled me . . . so Emily says. But three\n",
      "years ago she died. Before she died she worried a lot about what was\n",
      "to become of me and finally she got me to promise I'd get married. She\n",
      "advised me to take Emily Scott because Emily had money of her own and\n",
      "was a pattern housekeeper. I said, says I, 'Emily Scott wouldn't look at\n",
      "me.' 'You ask her and see,' says my sister; and just to ease her mind I\n",
      "promised her I would . . . and I did. And Emily said she'd have me. Never\n",
      "was so surprised in my life, Anne . . . a smart pretty little woman like\n",
      "her and an old fellow like me. I tell you I thought at first I was in\n",
      "luck. Well, we were married and took a little wedding trip to St. John\n",
      "for a fortnight and then we went home. We got home at ten o'clock at\n",
      "night, and I give you my word, Anne, that in half an hour that woman was\n",
      "at work housecleaning. Oh, I know you're thinking my house needed it . . .\n",
      "you've got a very expressive face, Anne; your thoughts just come out\n",
      "on it like print . . . but it didn't, not that bad. It had got pretty\n",
      "mixed up while I was keeping bachelor's hall, I admit, but I'd got a\n",
      "woman to come in and clean it up before I was married and there'd been\n",
      "considerable painting and fixing done. I tell you if you took Emily into\n",
      "a brand new white marble palace she'd be into the scrubbing as soon as\n",
      "she could get an old dress on. Well, she cleaned house till one o'clock\n",
      "that night and at four she was up and at it again. And she kept on that\n",
      "way . . . far's I could see she never stopped. It was scour and sweep and\n",
      "dust everlasting, except on Sundays, and then she was just longing for\n",
      "Monday to begin again. But it was her way of amusing herself and I\n",
      "could have reconciled myself to it if she'd left me alone. But that\n",
      "she wouldn't do. She'd set out to make me over but she hadn't caught me\n",
      "young enough. I wasn't allowed to come into the house unless I changed\n",
      "my boots for slippers at the door. I darsn't smoke a pipe for my life\n",
      "unless I went to the barn. And I didn't use good enough grammar. Emily'd\n",
      "been a schoolteacher in her early life and she'd never got over it. Then\n",
      "she hated to see me eating with my knife. Well, there it was, pick and\n",
      "nag everlasting. But I s'pose, Anne, to be fair, _I_ was cantankerous\n",
      "too. I didn't try to improve as I might have done . . . I just got cranky\n",
      "and disagreeable when she found fault. I told her one day she hadn't\n",
      "complained of my grammar when I proposed to her. It wasn't an overly\n",
      "tactful thing to say. A woman would forgive a man for beating her sooner\n",

      "\n",

      "redhaired. Do you remember, Anne?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"And then that 'apology' you made her. Well, you were a handful, in all\n",

      "you. Matthew understood you better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Matthew understood everything,\" said Anne softly, as she always spoke\n",
      "of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I think it could be managed so that Rachel and I wouldn't clash\n",
      "at all. It always seemed to me that the reason two women can't get along\n",
      "in one house is that they try to share the same kitchen and get in each\n",
      "other's way. Now, if Rachel came here, she could have the north gable\n",
      "for her bedroom and the spare room for a kitchen as well as not, for we\n",
      "don't really need a spare room at all. She could put her stove there\n",
      "and what furniture she wanted to keep, and be real comfortable and\n",
      "independent. She'll have enough to live on of course...her children'll\n",
      "see to that...so all I'd be giving her would be house room. Yes, Anne,\n",
      "far as I'm concerned I'd like it.\"\n",

      "do, so there's no reason in the world why you shouldn't go.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne had a long meditation at her window that night. Joy and regret\n",
      "struggled together in her heart. She had come at last . . . suddenly and\n",
      "unexpectedly . . . to the bend in the road; and college was around it,\n",
      "with a hundred rainbow hopes and visions; but Anne realized as well that\n",
      "when she rounded that curve she must leave many sweet things behind. . .\n",
      "all the little simple duties and interests which had grown so dear to\n",
      "her in the last two years and which she had glorified into beauty and\n",
      "delight by the enthusiasm she had put into them. She must give up her\n",
      "school . . .  and she loved every one of her pupils, even the stupid and\n",
      "naughty ones. The mere thought of Paul Irving made her wonder if Redmond\n",
      "were such a name to conjure with after all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've put out a lot of little roots these two years,\" Anne told the\n",

      "it's best to go, I think, and, as Marilla says, there's no good reason\n",
      "why I shouldn't. I must get out all my ambitions and dust them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne sent in her resignation the next day; and Mrs. Rachel, after a\n",
      "heart to heart talk with Marilla, gratefully accepted the offer of a\n",
      "home at Green Gables. She elected to remain in her own house for the\n",
      "summer, however; the farm was not to be sold until the fall and there\n",
      "were many arrangements to be made.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I certainly never thought of living as far off the road as Green\n",
      "Gables,\" sighed Mrs. Rachel to herself. \"But really, Green Gables\n",
      "doesn't seem as out of the world as it used to do . . . Anne has lots of\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I hope they won't call Mr. Baxter from East Grafton here, anyhow,\"\n",
      "said Anne decidedly. \"He wants the call but he does preach such gloomy\n",

      "man has to eat sour bread two weeks out of three his theology is bound\n",
      "to get a kink in it somewhere. Mrs. Allan feels very badly about going\n",
      "away. She says everybody has been so kind to her since she came here\n",
      "as a bride that she feels as if she were leaving lifelong friends. And\n",
      "then, there's the baby's grave, you know. She says she doesn't see how\n",
      "she can go away and leave that . . . it was such a little mite of a thing\n",
      "and only three months old, and she says she is afraid it will miss its\n",
      "mother, although she knows better and wouldn't say so to Mr. Allan for\n",
      "anything. She says she has slipped through the birch grove back of the\n",
      "manse nearly every night to the graveyard and sung a little lullaby to\n",
      "it. She told me all about it last evening when I was up putting some of\n",
      "those early wild roses on Matthew's grave. I promised her that as long\n",
      "as I was in Avonlea I would put flowers on the baby's grave and when I\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, thank you. I meant to ask you to if you would. And on little Hester\n",

      "dreamed so much about little Hester Gray that she has become strangely\n",
      "real to me. I think of her, back there in her little garden in that\n",
      "cool, still, green corner; and I have a fancy that if I could steal back\n",
      "there some spring evening, just at the magic time 'twixt light and\n",
      "dark, and tiptoe so softly up the beech hill that my footsteps could not\n",
      "frighten her, I would find the garden just as it used to be, all sweet\n",
      "with June lilies and early roses, with the tiny house beyond it all hung\n",
      "with vines; and little Hester Gray would be there, with her soft eyes,\n",
      "and the wind ruffling her dark hair, wandering about, putting her\n",
      "fingertips under the chins of the lilies and whispering secrets with the\n",
      "roses; and I would go forward, oh, so softly, and hold out my hands and\n",
      "say to her, 'Little Hester Gray, won't you let me be your playmate, for\n",
      "I love the roses too?' And we would sit down on the old bench and talk\n",
      "a little and dream a little, or just be beautifully silent together. And\n",
      "then the moon would rise and I would look around me  . . . and there would\n",
      "be no Hester Gray and no little vine-hung house, and no roses . . . only\n",
      "an old waste garden starred with June lilies amid the grasses, and the\n",
      "wind sighing, oh, so sorrowfully in the cherry trees. And I would not\n",
      "know whether it had been real or if I had just imagined it all.\" Diana\n",
      "crawled up and got her back against the headboard of the bed. When your\n",
      "companion of twilight hour said such spooky things it was just as well\n",
      "not to be able to fancy there was anything behind you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid the Improvement Society will go down when you and Gilbert\n",
      "are both gone,\" she remarked dolefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not a bit of fear of it,\" said Anne briskly, coming back from dreamland\n",
      "to the affairs of practical life. \"It is too firmly established for\n",
      "that, especially since the older people are becoming so enthusiastic\n",
      "about it. Look what they are doing this summer for their lawns and\n",
      "lanes. Besides, I'll be watching for hints at Redmond and I'll write a\n",
      "paper for it next winter and send it over. Don't take such a gloomy view\n",
      "of things, Diana. And don't grudge me my little hour of gladness and\n",
      "jubilation now. Later on, when I have to go away, I'll feel anything but\n",
      "glad.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's all right for you to be glad . . . you're going to college and\n",
      "you'll have a jolly time and make heaps of lovely new friends.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope I shall make new friends,\" said Anne thoughtfully. \"The\n",
      "possibilities of making new friends help to make life very fascinating.\n",
      "But no matter how many friends I make they'll never be as dear to me as\n",
      "the old ones . . . especially a certain girl with black eyes and dimples.\n",
      "Can you guess who she is, Diana?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But there'll be so many clever girls at Redmond,\" sighed Diana, \"and\n",
      "I'm only a stupid little country girl who says 'I seen' sometimes. . .\n",
      "though I really know better when I stop to think. Well, of course these\n",
      "past two years have really been too pleasant to last. I know SOMEBODY\n",
      "who is glad you are going to Redmond anyhow. Anne, I'm going to ask\n",
      "you a question . . . a serious question. Don't be vexed and do answer\n",
      "seriously. Do you care anything for Gilbert?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ever so much as a friend and not a bit in the way you mean,\" said Anne\n",
      "calmly and decidedly; she also thought she was speaking sincerely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diana sighed. She wished, somehow, that Anne had answered differently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you mean EVER to be married, Anne?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps . . . some day . . . when I meet the right one,\" said Anne,\n",
      "smiling dreamily up at the moonlight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But how can you be sure when you do meet the right one?\" persisted\n",
      "Diana.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I should know him . . . SOMETHING would tell me. You know what my\n",

      "\n",
      "\"But people's ideals change sometimes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mine won't. And I COULDN'T care for any man who didn't fulfill it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What if you never meet him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then I shall die an old maid,\" was the cheerful response. \"I daresay it\n",
      "isn't the hardest death by any means.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I suppose the dying would be easy enough; it's the living an old\n",
      "maid I shouldn't like,\" said Diana, with no intention of being humorous.\n",
      "\"Although I wouldn't mind being an old maid VERY much if I could be one\n",
      "like Miss Lavendar. But I never could be. When I'm forty-five I'll be\n",
      "horribly fat. And while there might be some romance about a thin old\n",
      "maid there couldn't possibly be any about a fat one. Oh, mind you,\n",
      "Nelson Atkins proposed to Ruby Gillis three weeks ago. Ruby told me all\n",
      "about it. She says she never had any intention of taking him, because\n",
      "any one who married him will have to go in with the old folks; but Ruby\n",
      "says that he made such a perfectly beautiful and romantic proposal that\n",
      "it simply swept her off her feet. But she didn't want to do anything\n",
      "rash so she asked for a week to consider; and two days later she was\n",
      "at a meeting of the Sewing Circle at his mother's and there was a book\n",
      "called 'The Complete Guide to Etiquette,' lying on the parlor table.\n",
      "Ruby said she simply couldn't describe her feelings when in a section\n",
      "of it headed, 'The Deportment of Courtship and Marriage,' she found the\n",
      "very proposal Nelson had made, word for word. She went home and wrote\n",
      "him a perfectly scathing refusal; and she says his father and mother\n",
      "have taken turns watching him ever since for fear he'll drown himself in\n",
      "the river; but Ruby says they needn't be afraid; for in the Deportment\n",
      "of Courtship and Marriage it told how a rejected lover should behave\n",
      "and there's nothing about drowning in THAT. And she says Wilbur Blair\n",
      "is literally pining away for her but she's perfectly helpless in the\n",
      "matter.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne made an impatient movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hate to say it . . . it seems so disloyal . . . but, well, I don't\n",
      "like Ruby Gillis now. I liked her when we went to school and Queen's\n",
      "together . . . though not so well as you and Jane of course. But this last\n",
      "year at Carmody she seems so different . . . so . . . so . . .\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know,\" nodded Diana. \"It's the Gillis coming out in her . . .  she\n",
      "can't help it. Mrs. Lynde says that if ever a Gillis girl thought about\n",
      "anything but the boys she never showed it in her walk and conversation.\n",
      "She talks about nothing but boys and what compliments they pay her, and\n",
      "how crazy they all are about her at Carmody. And the strange thing is,\n",
      "they ARE, too . . .\" Diana admitted this somewhat resentfully. \"Last\n",
      "night when I saw her in Mr. Blair's store she whispered to me that she'd\n",
      "just made a new 'mash.' I wouldn't ask her who it was, because I\n",
      "knew she was dying to BE asked. Well, it's what Ruby always wanted, I\n",
      "suppose. You remember even when she was little she always said she meant\n",
      "to have dozens of beaus when she grew up and have the very gayest time\n",
      "she could before she settled down. She's so different from Jane, isn't\n",
      "she? Jane is such a nice, sensible, lady-like girl.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear old Jane is a jewel,\" agreed Anne, \"but,\" she added, leaning\n",
      "forward to bestow a tender pat on the plump, dimpled little hand hanging\n",
      "over her pillow, \"there's nobody like my own Diana after all. Do\n",
      "you remember that evening we first met, Diana, and 'swore' eternal\n",
      "friendship in your garden? We've kept that 'oath,' I think . . . we've\n",
      "never had a quarrel nor even a coolness. I shall never forget the thrill\n",
      "that went over me the day you told me you loved me. I had had such a\n",
      "lonely, starved heart all through my childhood. I'm just beginning to\n",
      "realize how starved and lonely it really was. Nobody cared anything for\n",
      "me or wanted to be bothered with me. I should have been miserable if\n",
      "it hadn't been for that strange little dream-life of mine, wherein I\n",
      "imagined all the friends and love I craved. But when I came to Green\n",
      "Gables everything was changed. And then I met you. You don't know what\n",

      "\"Where are you going, all dressed up, Anne?\" Davy wanted to know. \"You\n",

      "\n",
      "Anne had come down to dinner in a new dress of pale green muslin . . .\n",
      "the first color she had worn since Matthew's death. It became her\n",
      "perfectly, bringing out all the delicate, flower-like tints of her face\n",
      "and the gloss and burnish of her hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Davy, how many times have I told you that you mustn't use that word,\"\n",
      "she rebuked. \"I'm going to Echo Lodge.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take me with you,\" entreated Davy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I would if I were driving. But I'm going to walk and it's too far for\n",
      "your eight-year-old legs. Besides, Paul is going with me and I fear you\n",
      "don't enjoy yourself in his company.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I like Paul lots better'n I did,\" said Davy, beginning to make\n",
      "fearful inroads into his pudding. \"Since I've got pretty good myself I\n",
      "don't mind his being gooder so much. If I can keep on I'll catch up with\n",
      "him some day, both in legs and goodness. 'Sides, Paul's real nice to\n",
      "us second primer boys in school. He won't let the other big boys meddle\n",
      "with us and he shows us lots of games.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How came Paul to fall into the brook at noon hour yesterday?\" asked\n",
      "Anne. \"I met him on the playground, such a dripping figure that I sent\n",

      "happened.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, it was partly a zacksident,\" explained Davy. \"He stuck his head\n",
      "in on purpose but the rest of him fell in zacksidentally. We was all\n",
      "down at the brook and Prillie Rogerson got mad at Paul about something\n",
      ". . . she's awful mean and horrid anyway, if she IS pretty . . . and said\n",
      "that his grandmother put his hair up in curl rags every night. Paul\n",
      "wouldn't have minded what she said, I guess, but Gracie Andrews laughed,\n",
      "and Paul got awful red, 'cause Gracie's his girl, you know. He's CLEAN\n",
      "GONE on her . . . brings her flowers and carries her books as far as the\n",
      "shore road. He got as red as a beet and said his grandmother didn't do\n",
      "any such thing and his hair was born curly. And then he laid down on\n",
      "the bank and stuck his head right into the spring to show them. Oh,\n",
      "it wasn't the spring we drink out of . . .\" seeing a horrified look on\n",
      "Marilla's face . . . \"it was the little one lower down. But the bank's\n",
      "awful slippy and Paul went right in. I tell you he made a bully splash.\n",
      "Oh, Anne, Anne, I didn't mean to say that . . . it just slipped out before\n",
      "I thought. He made a SPLENDID splash. But he looked so funny when he\n",
      "crawled out, all wet and muddy. The girls laughed more'n ever, but\n",
      "Gracie didn't laugh. She looked sorry. Gracie's a nice girl but she's\n",
      "got a snub nose. When I get big enough to have a girl I won't have one\n",
      "with a snub nose . . . I'll pick one with a pretty nose like yours, Anne.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A boy who makes such a mess of syrup all over his face when he is\n",
      "eating his pudding will never get a girl to look at him,\" said Marilla\n",
      "severely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I'll wash my face before I go courting,\" protested Davy, trying to\n",
      "improve matters by rubbing the back of his hand over the smears. \"And\n",
      "I'll wash behind my ears too, without being told. I remembered to this\n",
      "morning, Marilla. I don't forget half as often as I did. But . . .\" and\n",
      "Davy sighed . . . \"there's so many corners about a fellow that it's awful\n",
      "hard to remember them all. Well, if I can't go to Miss Lavendar's I'll\n",
      "go over and see Mrs. Harrison. Mrs. Harrison's an awful nice woman, I\n",
      "tell you. She keeps a jar of cookies in her pantry a-purpose for little\n",
      "boys, and she always gives me the scrapings out of a pan she's mixed\n",
      "up a plum cake in. A good many plums stick to the sides, you see. Mr.\n",
      "Harrison was always a nice man, but he's twice as nice since he got\n",

      "YOU get married, Marilla? I want to know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marilla's state of single blessedness had never been a sore point with\n",
      "her, so she answered amiably, with an exchange of significant looks with\n",
      "Anne, that she supposed it was because nobody would have her.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But maybe you never asked anybody to have you,\" protested Davy.\n",

      "to, \"it's the MEN that have to do the asking.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know why they have to do it ALWAYS,\" grumbled Davy. \"Seems\n",

      "pudding, Marilla?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You've had as much as was good for you,\" said Marilla; but she gave him\n",

      "\"I wish people could live on pudding. Why can't they, Marilla? I want to\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Because they'd soon get tired of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'd like to try that for myself,\" said skeptical Davy. \"But I guess\n",
      "it's better to have pudding only on fish and company days than none at\n",
      "all. They never have any at Milty Boulter's. Milty says when company\n",
      "comes his mother gives them cheese and cuts it herself . . . one little\n",
      "bit apiece and one over for manners.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If Milty Boulter talks like that about his mother at least you needn't\n",

      "\"Bless my soul,\" . . . Davy had picked this expression up from Mr.\n",
      "Harrison and used it with great gusto . . . \"Milty meant it as a\n",

      "\"I . . . I suppose them pesky hens are in my pansy bed again,\" said\n",

      "The slandered hens were nowhere near the pansy bed and Marilla did not\n",

      "unwholesome. That is why we have them so often at Echo Lodge. We. . .\n",
      "Charlotta the Fourth and I . . . live in defiance of every known law\n",
      "of diet. We eat all sorts of indigestible things whenever we happen to\n",
      "think of it, by day or night; and we flourish like green bay trees.\n",
      "We are always intending to reform. When we read any article in a paper\n",
      "warning us against something we like we cut it out and pin it up on the\n",
      "kitchen wall so that we'll remember it. But we never can somehow . . .\n",
      "until after we've gone and eaten that very thing. Nothing has ever\n",
      "killed us yet; but Charlotta the Fourth has been known to have bad\n",
      "dreams after we had eaten doughnuts and mince pie and fruit cake before\n",
      "we went to bed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Grandma lets me have a glass of milk and a slice of bread and butter\n",
      "before I go to bed; and on Sunday nights she puts jam on the bread,\"\n",
      "said Paul. \"So I'm always glad when it's Sunday night . . .  for more\n",
      "reasons than one. Sunday is a very long day on the shore road. Grandma\n",
      "says it's all too short for her and that father never found Sundays\n",
      "tiresome when he was a little boy. It wouldn't seem so long if I could\n",
      "talk to my rock people but I never do that because Grandma doesn't\n",
      "approve of it on Sundays. I think a good deal; but I'm afraid my\n",
      "thoughts are worldly. Grandma says we should never think anything but\n",
      "religious thoughts on Sundays. But teacher here said once that every\n",
      "really beautiful thought was religious, no matter what it was about, or\n",
      "what day we thought it on. But I feel sure Grandma thinks that sermons\n",
      "and Sunday School lessons are the only things you can think truly\n",
      "religious thoughts about. And when it comes to a difference of opinion\n",
      "between Grandma and teacher I don't know what to do. In my heart\" . . .\n",
      "Paul laid his hand on his breast and raised very serious blue eyes to\n",
      "Miss Lavendar's immediately sympathetic face . . . \"I agree with teacher.\n",
      "But then, you see, Grandma has brought father up HER way and made a\n",
      "brilliant success of him; and teacher has never brought anybody up yet,\n",
      "though she's helping with Davy and Dora. But you can't tell how they'll\n",
      "turn out till they ARE grown up. So sometimes I feel as if it might be\n",
      "safer to go by Grandma's opinions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think it would,\" agreed Anne solemnly. \"Anyway, I daresay that if\n",
      "your Grandma and I both got down to what we really do mean, under our\n",
      "different ways of expressing it, we'd find out we both meant much the\n",
      "same thing. You'd better go by her way of expressing it, since it's been\n",
      "the result of experience. We'll have to wait until we see how the twins\n",
      "do turn out before we can be sure that my way is equally good.\" After\n",
      "lunch they went back to the garden, where Paul made the acquaintance of\n",
      "the echoes, to his wonder and delight, while Anne and Miss Lavendar sat\n",
      "on the stone bench under the poplar and talked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So you are going away in the fall?\" said Miss Lavendar wistfully. \"I\n",
      "ought to be glad for your sake, Anne . . . but I'm horribly, selfishly\n",
      "sorry. I shall miss you so much. Oh, sometimes, I think it is of no use\n",
      "to make friends. They only go out of your life after awhile and leave a\n",
      "hurt that is worse than the emptiness before they came.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That sounds like something Miss Eliza Andrews might say but never Miss\n",
      "Lavendar,\" said Anne. \"NOTHING is worse than emptiness . . . and I'm not\n",
      "going out of your life. There are such things as letters and vacations.\n",
      "Dearest, I'm afraid you're looking a little pale and tired.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh . . . hoo . . . hoo . . . hoo,\" went Paul on the dyke, where he had\n",
      "been making noises diligently . . . not all of them melodious in the\n",
      "making, but all coming back transmuted into the very gold and silver of\n",
      "sound by the fairy alchemists over the river. Miss Lavendar made an\n",
      "impatient movement with her pretty hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm just tired of everything . . . even of the echoes. There is nothing\n",
      "in my life but echoes . . . echoes of lost hopes and dreams and joys.\n",
      "They're beautiful and mocking. Oh Anne, it's horrid of me to talk like\n",
      "this when I have company. It's just that I'm getting old and it doesn't\n",
      "agree with me. I know I'll be fearfully cranky by the time I'm sixty.\n",
      "But perhaps all I need is a course of blue pills.\" At this moment\n",
      "Charlotta the Fourth, who had disappeared after lunch, returned, and\n",
      "announced that the northeast corner of Mr. John Kimball's pasture was\n",
      "red with early strawberries, and wouldn't Miss Shirley like to go and\n",
      "pick some.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Early strawberries for tea!\" exclaimed Miss Lavendar. \"Oh, I'm not so\n",
      "old as I thought . . . and I don't need a single blue pill! Girls, when\n",
      "you come back with your strawberries we'll have tea out here under the\n",
      "silver poplar. I'll have it all ready for you with home-grown cream.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne and Charlotta the Fourth accordingly betook themselves back to Mr.\n",
      "Kimball's pasture, a green remote place where the air was as soft as\n",
      "velvet and fragrant as a bed of violets and golden as amber.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, isn't it sweet and fresh back here?\" breathed Anne. \"I just feel as\n",
      "if I were drinking in the sunshine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, ma'am, so do I. That's just exactly how I feel too, ma'am,\" agreed\n",
      "Charlotta the Fourth, who would have said precisely the same thing if\n",
      "Anne had remarked that she felt like a pelican of the wilderness. Always\n",
      "after Anne had visited Echo Lodge Charlotta the Fourth mounted to her\n",
      "little room over the kitchen and tried before her looking glass to speak\n",
      "and look and move like Anne. Charlotta could never flatter herself\n",
      "that she quite succeeded; but practice makes perfect, as Charlotta had\n",
      "learned at school, and she fondly hoped that in time she might catch the\n",
      "trick of that dainty uplift of chin, that quick, starry outflashing\n",
      "of eyes, that fashion of walking as if you were a bough swaying in the\n",
      "wind. It seemed so easy when you watched Anne. Charlotta the Fourth\n",
      "admired Anne wholeheartedly. It was not that she thought her so very\n",
      "handsome. Diana Barry's beauty of crimson cheek and black curls was\n",
      "much more to Charlotta the Fourth's taste than Anne's moonshine charm of\n",
      "luminous gray eyes and the pale, everchanging roses of her cheeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I'd rather look like you than be pretty,\" she told Anne sincerely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne laughed, sipped the honey from the tribute, and cast away the\n",
      "sting. She was used to taking her compliments mixed. Public opinion\n",
      "never agreed on Anne's looks. People who had heard her called handsome\n",
      "met her and were disappointed. People who had heard her called plain\n",
      "saw her and wondered where other people's eyes were. Anne herself would\n",
      "never believe that she had any claim to beauty. When she looked in the\n",
      "glass all she saw was a little pale face with seven freckles on the nose\n",
      "thereof. Her mirror never revealed to her the elusive, ever-varying play\n",
      "of feeling that came and went over her features like a rosy illuminating\n",
      "flame, or the charm of dream and laughter alternating in her big eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Anne was not beautiful in any strictly defined sense of the word\n",
      "she possessed a certain evasive charm and distinction of appearance that\n",
      "left beholders with a pleasurable sense of satisfaction in that softly\n",
      "rounded girlhood of hers, with all its strongly felt potentialities.\n",
      "Those who knew Anne best felt, without realizing that they felt it, that\n",
      "her greatest attraction was the aura of possibility surrounding her. . .\n",
      "the power of future development that was in her. She seemed to walk in\n",
      "an atmosphere of things about to happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they picked, Charlotta the Fourth confided to Anne her fears\n",
      "regarding Miss Lavendar. The warm-hearted little handmaiden was honestly\n",
      "worried over her adored mistress' condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Lavendar isn't well, Miss Shirley, ma'am. I'm sure she isn't,\n",
      "though she never complains. She hasn't seemed like herself this long\n",
      "while, ma'am . . . not since that day you and Paul were here together\n",
      "before. I feel sure she caught cold that night, ma'am. After you and him\n",
      "had gone she went out and walked in the garden for long after dark with\n",
      "nothing but a little shawl on her. There was a lot of snow on the walks\n",
      "and I feel sure she got a chill, ma'am. Ever since then I've noticed her\n",
      "acting tired and lonesome like. She don't seem to take an interest in\n",
      "anything, ma'am. She never pretends company's coming, nor fixes up for\n",
      "it, nor nothing, ma'am. It's only when you come she seems to chirk up a\n",
      "bit. And the worst sign of all, Miss Shirley, ma'am . . .\" Charlotta the\n",
      "Fourth lowered her voice as if she were about to tell some exceedingly\n",
      "weird and awful symptom indeed . . . \"is that she never gets cross now\n",
      "when I breaks things. Why, Miss Shirley, ma'am, yesterday I bruk\n",
      "her green and yaller bowl that's always stood on the bookcase. Her\n",
      "grandmother brought it out from England and Miss Lavendar was awful\n",
      "choice of it. I was dusting it just as careful, Miss Shirley, ma'am, and\n",
      "it slipped out, so fashion, afore I could grab holt of it, and bruk into\n",
      "about forty millyun pieces. I tell you I was sorry and scared. I thought\n",
      "Miss Lavendar would scold me awful, ma'am; and I'd ruther she had than\n",
      "take it the way she did. She just come in and hardly looked at it and\n",
      "said, 'It's no matter, Charlotta. Take up the pieces and throw them\n",
      "away.' Just like that, Miss Shirley, ma'am . . . 'take up the pieces and\n",
      "throw them away,' as if it wasn't her grandmother's bowl from England.\n",
      "Oh, she isn't well and I feel awful bad about it. She's got nobody to\n",
      "look after her but me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlotta the Fourth's eyes brimmed up with tears. Anne patted the\n",
      "little brown paw holding the cracked pink cup sympathetically.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think Miss Lavendar needs a change, Charlotta. She stays here alone\n",
      "too much. Can't we induce her to go away for a little trip?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlotta shook her head, with its rampant bows, disconsolately.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't think so, Miss Shirley, ma'am. Miss Lavendar hates visiting.\n",
      "She's only got three relations she ever visits and she says she just\n",
      "goes to see them as a family duty. Last time when she come home she said\n",
      "she wasn't going to visit for family duty no more. 'I've come home in\n",
      "love with loneliness, Charlotta,' she says to me, 'and I never want to\n",
      "stray from my own vine and fig tree again. My relations try so hard to\n",
      "make an old lady of me and it has a bad effect on me.' Just like that,\n",
      "Miss Shirley, ma'am. 'It has a very bad effect on me.' So I don't think\n",
      "it would do any good to coax her to go visiting.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We must see what can be done,\" said Anne decidedly, as she put the last\n",
      "possible berry in her pink cup. \"Just as soon as I have my vacation I'll\n",
      "come through and spend a whole week with you. We'll have a picnic every\n",
      "day and pretend all sorts of interesting things, and see if we can't\n",
      "cheer Miss Lavendar up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That will be the very thing, Miss Shirley, ma'am,\" exclaimed Charlotta\n",
      "the Fourth in rapture. She was glad for Miss Lavendar's sake and for her\n",
      "own too. With a whole week in which to study Anne constantly she would\n",
      "surely be able to learn how to move and behave like her.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the girls got back to Echo Lodge they found that Miss Lavendar\n",
      "and Paul had carried the little square table out of the kitchen to\n",
      "the garden and had everything ready for tea. Nothing ever tasted so\n",
      "delicious as those strawberries and cream, eaten under a great blue\n",
      "sky all curdled over with fluffy little white clouds, and in the long\n",
      "shadows of the wood with its lispings and its murmurings. After tea Anne\n",
      "helped Charlotta wash the dishes in the kitchen, while Miss Lavendar sat\n",
      "on the stone bench with Paul and heard all about his rock people. She\n",
      "was a good listener, this sweet Miss Lavendar, but just at the last it\n",
      "struck Paul that she had suddenly lost interest in the Twin Sailors.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Lavendar, why do you look at me like that?\" he asked gravely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How do I look, Paul?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Just as if you were looking through me at somebody I put you in mind\n",
      "of,\" said Paul, who had such occasional flashes of uncanny insight that\n",
      "it wasn't quite safe to have secrets when he was about.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You do put me in mind of somebody I knew long ago,\" said Miss Lavendar\n",
      "dreamily.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When you were young?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, when I was young. Do I seem very old to you, Paul?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you know, I can't make up my mind about that,\" said Paul\n",
      "confidentially. \"Your hair looks old . . . I never knew a young person\n",
      "with white hair. But your eyes are as young as my beautiful teacher's\n",
      "when you laugh. I tell you what, Miss Lavendar\" . . .  Paul's voice and\n",
      "face were as solemn as a judge's . . . \"I think you would make a splendid\n",
      "mother. You have just the right look in your eyes . . .  the look my\n",
      "little mother always had. I think it's a pity you haven't any boys of\n",
      "your own.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have a little dream boy, Paul.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, have you really? How old is he?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About your age I think. He ought to be older because I dreamed him long\n",
      "before you were born. But I'll never let him get any older than eleven\n",
      "or twelve; because if I did some day he might grow up altogether and\n",
      "then I'd lose him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know,\" nodded Paul. \"That's the beauty of dream-people . . . they stay\n",
      "any age you want them. You and my beautiful teacher and me myself are\n",
      "the only folks in the world that I know of that have dream-people. Isn't\n",
      "it funny and nice we should all know each other? But I guess that kind\n",
      "of people always find each other out. Grandma never has dream-people and\n",
      "Mary Joe thinks I'm wrong in the upper story because I have them. But I\n",
      "think it's splendid to have them. YOU know, Miss Lavendar. Tell me all\n",
      "about your little dream-boy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He has blue eyes and curly hair. He steals in and wakens me with a kiss\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I know,\" interrupted Paul eagerly. \"He comes and sits beside you . . .\n",
      "SO . . . because of course at twelve he'd be too big to climb into your\n",

      "your arms about him and hold him tight, tight, and rest your cheek on\n",

      "own sweet personality than by all her careful precepts, that it was good\n",
      "and necessary in the years that were before them to live their lives\n",
      "finely and graciously, holding fast to truth and courtesy and kindness,\n",
      "keeping aloof from all that savored of falsehood and meanness and\n",
      "vulgarity. They were, perhaps, all unconscious of having learned such\n",
      "lessons; but they would remember and practice them long after they had\n",
      "forgotten the capital of Afghanistan and the dates of the Wars of the\n",
      "Roses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Another chapter in my life is closed,\" said Anne aloud, as she locked\n",
      "her desk. She really felt very sad over it; but the romance in the idea\n",
      "of that \"closed chapter\" did comfort her a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne spent a fortnight at Echo Lodge early in her vacation and everybody\n",
      "concerned had a good time.\n",
      "\n",
      "She took Miss Lavendar on a shopping expedition to town and persuaded\n",
      "her to buy a new organdy dress; then came the excitement of cutting\n",
      "and making it together, while the happy Charlotta the Fourth basted and\n",
      "swept up clippings. Miss Lavendar had complained that she could not feel\n",
      "much interest in anything, but the sparkle came back to her eyes over\n",
      "her pretty dress.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a foolish, frivolous person I must be,\" she sighed. \"I'm\n",
      "wholesomely ashamed to think that a new dress . . .  even it is a\n",
      "forget-me-not organdy . . . should exhilarate me so, when a good\n",
      "conscience and an extra contribution to Foreign Missions couldn't do\n",
      "it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Midway in her visit Anne went home to Green Gables for a day to mend the\n",
      "twins' stockings and settle up Davy's accumulated store of questions. In\n",
      "the evening she went down to the shore road to see Paul Irving. As she\n",
      "passed by the low, square window of the Irving sitting room she caught\n",
      "a glimpse of Paul on somebody's lap; but the next moment he came flying\n",
      "through the hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Miss Shirley,\" he cried excitedly, \"you can't think what has\n",
      "happened! Something so splendid. Father is here . . .  just think of that!\n",
      "Father is here! Come right in. Father, this is my beautiful teacher. YOU\n",
      "know, father.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Stephen Irving came forward to meet Anne with a smile. He was a tall,\n",
      "handsome man of middle age, with iron-gray hair, deep-set, dark blue\n",
      "eyes, and a strong, sad face, splendidly modeled about chin and brow.\n",
      "Just the face for a hero of romance, Anne thought with a thrill of\n",
      "intense satisfaction. It was so disappointing to meet someone who ought\n",
      "to be a hero and find him bald or stooped, or otherwise lacking in\n",
      "manly beauty. Anne would have thought it dreadful if the object of Miss\n",
      "Lavendar's romance had not looked the part.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So this is my little son's 'beautiful teacher,' of whom I have heard\n",
      "so much,\" said Mr. Irving with a hearty handshake. \"Paul's letters have\n",
      "been so full of you, Miss Shirley, that I feel as if I were pretty well\n",
      "acquainted with you already. I want to thank you for what you have done\n",
      "for Paul. I think that your influence has been just what he needed.\n",
      "Mother is one of the best and dearest of women; but her robust,\n",
      "matter-of-fact Scotch common sense could not always understand a\n",
      "temperament like my laddie's. What was lacking in her you have supplied.\n",
      "Between you, I think Paul's training in these two past years has been as\n",
      "nearly ideal as a motherless boy's could be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody likes to be appreciated. Under Mr. Irving's praise Anne's\n",
      "face \"burst flower like into rosy bloom,\" and the busy, weary man of the\n",
      "world, looking at her, thought he had never seen a fairer, sweeter slip\n",
      "of girlhood than this little \"down east\" schoolteacher with her red hair\n",
      "and wonderful eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul sat between them blissfully happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I never dreamed father was coming,\" he said radiantly. \"Even Grandma\n",
      "didn't know it. It was a great surprise. As a general thing . . .\" Paul\n",
      "shook his brown curls gravely . . . \"I don't like to be surprised. You\n",
      "lose all the fun of expecting things when you're surprised. But in a\n",
      "case like this it is all right. Father came last night after I had gone\n",
      "to bed. And after Grandma and Mary Joe had stopped being surprised he\n",
      "and Grandma came upstairs to look at me, not meaning to wake me up till\n",
      "morning. But I woke right up and saw father. I tell you I just sprang at\n",
      "him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"With a hug like a bear's,\" said Mr. Irving, putting his arms around\n",
      "Paul's shoulder smilingly. \"I hardly knew my boy, he had grown so big\n",
      "and brown and sturdy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know which was the most pleased to see father, Grandma or I,\"\n",
      "continued Paul. \"Grandma's been in kitchen all day making the things\n",
      "father likes to eat. She wouldn't trust them to Mary Joe, she says.\n",
      "That's HER way of showing gladness. _I_ like best just to sit and talk\n",
      "to father. But I'm going to leave you for a little while now if you'll\n",
      "excuse me. I must get the cows for Mary Joe. That is one of my daily\n",
      "duties.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When Paul had scampered away to do his \"daily duty\" Mr. Irving talked to\n",
      "Anne of various matters. But Anne felt that he was thinking of something\n",
      "else underneath all the time. Presently it came to the surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In Paul's last letter he spoke of going with you to visit an old . . .\n",
      "friend of mine . . . Miss Lewis at the stone house in Grafton. Do you know\n",
      "her well?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, indeed, she is a very dear friend of mine,\" was Anne's demure\n",
      "reply, which gave no hint of the sudden thrill that tingled over her\n",
      "from head to foot at Mr. Irving's question. Anne \"felt instinctively\"\n",
      "that romance was peeping at her around a corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Irving rose and went to the window, looking out on a great, golden,\n",
      "billowing sea where a wild wind was harping. For a few moments there was\n",
      "silence in the little dark-walled room. Then he turned and looked down\n",
      "into Anne's sympathetic face with a smile, half-whimsical, half-tender.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wonder how much you know,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know all about it,\" replied Anne promptly. \"You see,\" she explained\n",
      "hastily, \"Miss Lavendar and I are very intimate. She wouldn't tell\n",
      "things of such a sacred nature to everybody. We are kindred spirits.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I believe you are. Well, I am going to ask a favor of you. I would\n",
      "like to go and see Miss Lavendar if she will let me. Will you ask her if\n",
      "I may come?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Would she not? Oh, indeed she would! Yes, this was romance, the very,\n",
      "the real thing, with all the charm of rhyme and story and dream. It was\n",
      "a little belated, perhaps, like a rose blooming in October which should\n",
      "have bloomed in June; but none the less a rose, all sweetness and\n",
      "fragrance, with the gleam of gold in its heart. Never did Anne's\n",
      "feet bear her on a more willing errand than on that walk through the\n",
      "beechwoods to Grafton the next morning. She found Miss Lavendar in the\n",
      "garden. Anne was fearfully excited. Her hands grew cold and her voice\n",
      "trembled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Lavendar, I have something to tell you . . . something very\n",
      "important. Can you guess what it is?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne never supposed that Miss Lavendar could GUESS; but Miss Lavendar's\n",
      "face grew very pale and Miss Lavendar said in a quiet, still voice,\n",
      "from which all the color and sparkle that Miss Lavendar's voice usually\n",
      "suggested had faded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stephen Irving is home?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How did you know? Who told you?\" cried Anne disappointedly, vexed that\n",
      "her great revelation had been anticipated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nobody. I knew that must be it, just from the way you spoke.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He wants to come and see you,\" said Anne. \"May I send him word that he\n",
      "may?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, of course,\" fluttered Miss Lavendar. \"There is no reason why he\n",
      "shouldn't. He is only coming as any old friend might.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne had her own opinion about that as she hastened into the house to\n",
      "write a note at Miss Lavendar's desk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, it's delightful to be living in a storybook,\" she thought gaily.\n",
      "\"It will come out all right of course . . . it must . . . and Paul will\n",
      "have a mother after his own heart and everybody will be happy. But Mr.\n",
      "Irving will take Miss Lavendar away . . . and dear knows what will\n",
      "happen to the little stone house . . . and so there are two sides to it,\n",
      "as there seems to be to everything in this world.\" The important note\n",
      "was written and Anne herself carried it to the Grafton post office,\n",
      "where she waylaid the mail carrier and asked him to leave it at the\n",
      "Avonlea office.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's so very important,\" Anne assured him anxiously. The mail carrier\n",
      "was a rather grumpy old personage who did not at all look the part of a\n",
      "messenger of Cupid; and Anne was none too certain that his memory was to\n",
      "be trusted. But he said he would do his best to remember and she had to\n",
      "be contented with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlotta the Fourth felt that some mystery pervaded the stone house\n",
      "that afternoon . . . a mystery from which she was excluded. Miss Lavendar\n",
      "roamed about the garden in a distracted fashion. Anne, too, seemed\n",
      "possessed by a demon of unrest, and walked to and fro and went up and\n",
      "down. Charlotta the Fourth endured it till patience ceased to be a\n",
      "virtue; then she confronted Anne on the occasion of that romantic young\n",
      "person's third aimless peregrination through the kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please, Miss Shirley, ma'am,\" said Charlotta the Fourth, with an\n",
      "indignant toss of her very blue bows, \"it's plain to be seen you and\n",
      "Miss Lavendar have got a secret and I think, begging your pardon if I'm\n",
      "too forward, Miss Shirley, ma'am, that it's real mean not to tell me\n",
      "when we've all been such chums.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Charlotta dear, I'd have told you all about it if it were my\n",
      "secret . . . but it's Miss Lavendar's, you see. However, I'll tell you\n",
      "this much . . . and if nothing comes of it you must never breathe a word\n",
      "about it to a living soul. You see, Prince Charming is coming tonight.\n",
      "He came long ago, but in a foolish moment went away and wandered afar\n",
      "and forgot the secret of the magic pathway to the enchanted castle,\n",
      "where the princess was weeping her faithful heart out for him. But\n",
      "at last he remembered it again and the princess is waiting still. . .\n",
      "because nobody but her own dear prince could carry her off.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Miss Shirley, ma'am, what is that in prose?\" gasped the mystified\n",
      "Charlotta.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In prose, an old friend of Miss Lavendar's is coming to see her\n",
      "tonight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you mean an old beau of hers?\" demanded the literal Charlotta.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is probably what I do mean . . . in prose,\" answered Anne gravely.\n",
      "\"It is Paul's father . . . Stephen Irving. And goodness knows what will\n",
      "come of it, but let us hope for the best, Charlotta.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope that he'll marry Miss Lavendar,\" was Charlotta's unequivocal\n",
      "response. \"Some women's intended from the start to be old maids, and I'm\n",
      "afraid I'm one of them, Miss Shirley, ma'am, because I've awful little\n",
      "patience with the men. But Miss Lavendar never was. And I've been awful\n",
      "worried, thinking what on earth she'd do when I got so big I'd HAVE to\n",
      "go to Boston. There ain't any more girls in our family and dear\n",
      "knows what she'd do if she got some stranger that might laugh at her\n",
      "pretendings and leave things lying round out of their place and not\n",
      "be willing to be called Charlotta the Fifth. She might get someone who\n",
      "wouldn't be as unlucky as me in breaking dishes but she'd never get\n",
      "anyone who'd love her better.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And the faithful little handmaiden dashed to the oven door with a sniff.\n",
      "\n",
      "They went through the form of having tea as usual that night at Echo\n",
      "Lodge; but nobody really ate anything. After tea Miss Lavendar went to\n",
      "her room and put on her new forget-me-not organdy, while Anne did her\n",
      "hair for her. Both were dreadfully excited; but Miss Lavendar pretended\n",
      "to be very calm and indifferent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must really mend that rent in the curtain tomorrow,\" she said\n",
      "anxiously, inspecting it as if it were the only thing of any importance\n",
      "just then. \"Those curtains have not worn as well as they should,\n",
      "considering the price I paid. Dear me, Charlotta has forgotten to dust\n",
      "the stair railing AGAIN. I really MUST speak to her about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne was sitting on the porch steps when Stephen Irving came down the\n",
      "lane and across the garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is the one place where time stands still,\" he said, looking around\n",
      "him with delighted eyes. \"There is nothing changed about this house or\n",
      "garden since I was here twenty-five years ago. It makes me feel young\n",
      "again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know time always does stand still in an enchanted palace,\" said\n",
      "Anne seriously. \"It is only when the prince comes that things begin to\n",
      "happen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Irving smiled a little sadly into her uplifted face, all astar with\n",
      "its youth and promise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sometimes the prince comes too late,\" he said. He did not ask Anne\n",
      "to translate her remark into prose. Like all kindred spirits he\n",
      "\"understood.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no, not if he is the real prince coming to the true princess,\" said\n",
      "Anne, shaking her red head decidedly, as she opened the parlor door.\n",
      "When he had gone in she shut it tightly behind him and turned to\n",
      "confront Charlotta the Fourth, who was in the hall, all \"nods and becks\n",
      "and wreathed smiles.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Miss Shirley, ma'am,\" she breathed, \"I peeked from the kitchen\n",

      "Lavendar. And oh, Miss Shirley, ma'am, do you think it would be much\n",
      "harm to listen at the door?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It would be dreadful, Charlotta,\" said Anne firmly, \"so just you come\n",
      "away with me out of the reach of temptation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't do anything, and it's awful to hang round just waiting,\" sighed\n",
      "Charlotta. \"What if he don't propose after all, Miss Shirley, ma'am?\n",
      "You can never be sure of them men. My older sister, Charlotta the\n",
      "First, thought she was engaged to one once. But it turned out HE had a\n",
      "different opinion and she says she'll never trust one of them again. And\n",
      "I heard of another case where a man thought he wanted one girl awful bad\n",
      "when it was really her sister he wanted all the time. When a man don't\n",

      "sure of it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We'll go to the kitchen and clean the silver spoons,\" said Anne.\n",
      "\"That's a task which won't require much thinking fortunately . . .  for I\n",
      "COULDN'T think tonight. And it will pass the time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It passed an hour. Then, just as Anne laid down the last shining spoon,\n",
      "they heard the front door shut. Both sought comfort fearfully in each\n",
      "other's eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Miss Shirley, ma'am,\" gasped Charlotta, \"if he's going away this\n",
      "early there's nothing into it and never will be.\" They flew to the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No, I can understand that,\" said Charlotta. \"A wedding ain't poetry.\n",

      "and plannings and discussions, with Charlotta the Fourth hovering on the\n",
      "outskirts of things in agitated delight and wonder. Then the dressmaker\n",
      "came, and there was the rapture and wretchedness of choosing fashions\n",
      "and being fitted. Anne and Diana spent half their time at Echo Lodge and\n",
      "there were nights when Anne could not sleep for wondering whether she\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, it's all so romantic,\" breathed Anne to Marilla that night. \"If I\n",
      "hadn't taken the wrong path that day we went to Mr. Kimball's I'd never\n",
      "have known Miss Lavendar; and if I hadn't met her I'd never have taken\n",
      "Paul there . . . and he'd never have written to his father about visiting\n",
      "Miss Lavendar just as Mr. Irving was starting for San Francisco. Mr.\n",
      "Irving says whenever he got that letter he made up his mind to send his\n",
      "partner to San Francisco and come here instead. He hadn't heard anything\n",
      "of Miss Lavendar for fifteen years. Somebody had told him then that\n",
      "she was to be married and he thought she was and never asked anybody\n",
      "anything about her. And now everything has come right. And I had a\n",
      "hand in bringing it about. Perhaps, as Mrs. Lynde says, everything is\n",
      "foreordained and it was bound to happen anyway. But even so, it's nice\n",
      "to think one was an instrument used by predestination. Yes indeed, it's\n",
      "very romantic.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't see that it's so terribly romantic at all,\" said Marilla rather\n",
      "crisply. Marilla thought Anne was too worked up about it and had plenty\n",
      "to do with getting ready for college without \"traipsing\" to Echo Lodge\n",
      "two days out of three helping Miss Lavendar. \"In the first place two\n",
      "young fools quarrel and turn sulky; then Steve Irving goes to the States\n",
      "and after a spell gets married up there and is perfectly happy from all\n",
      "accounts. Then his wife dies and after a decent interval he thinks he'll\n",
      "come home and see if his first fancy'll have him. Meanwhile, she's been\n",
      "living single, probably because nobody nice enough came along to want\n",
      "her, and they meet and agree to be married after all. Now, where is the\n",
      "romance in all that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, there isn't any, when you put it that way,\" gasped Anne, rather\n",
      "as if somebody had thrown cold water over her. \"I suppose that's how\n",
      "it looks in prose. But it's very different if you look at it through\n",
      "poetry . . . and _I_ think it's nicer . . .\" Anne recovered herself and\n",
      "her eyes shone and her cheeks flushed . . . \"to look at it through\n",
      "poetry.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marilla glanced at the radiant young face and refrained from further\n",
      "sarcastic comments. Perhaps some realization came to her that after all\n",
      "it was better to have, like Anne, \"the vision and the faculty divine\"\n",
      ". . . that gift which the world cannot bestow or take away, of looking at\n",
      "life through some transfiguring . . . or revealing? . . . medium, whereby\n",
      "everything seemed apparelled in celestial light, wearing a glory and\n",
      "a freshness not visible to those who, like herself and Charlotta the\n",
      "Fourth, looked at things only through prose.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When's the wedding to be?\" she asked after a pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The last Wednesday in August. They are to be married in the garden\n",
      "under the honeysuckle trellis . . . the very spot where Mr. Irving\n",
      "proposed to her twenty-five years ago. Marilla, that IS romantic, even\n",
      "in prose. There's to be nobody there except Mrs. Irving and Paul and\n",
      "Gilbert and Diana and I, and Miss Lavendar's cousins. And they will\n",
      "leave on the six o'clock train for a trip to the Pacific coast. When\n",
      "they come back in the fall Paul and Charlotta the Fourth are to go up to\n",
      "Boston to live with them. But Echo Lodge is to be left just as it is. . .\n",
      "only of course they'll sell the hens and cow, and board up the windows\n",
      ". . . and every summer they're coming down to live in it. I'm so glad. It\n",
      "would have hurt me dreadfully next winter at Redmond to think of that\n",
      "dear stone house all stripped and deserted, with empty rooms . . . or far\n",
      "worse still, with other people living in it. But I can think of it now,\n",

      "\n",
      "There was more romance in the world than that which had fallen to\n",
      "the share of the middle-aged lovers of the stone house. Anne stumbled\n",
      "suddenly on it one evening when she went over to Orchard Slope by the\n",
      "wood cut and came out into the Barry garden. Diana Barry and Fred Wright\n",
      "were standing together under the big willow. Diana was leaning against\n",
      "the gray trunk, her lashes cast down on very crimson cheeks. One hand\n",
      "was held by Fred, who stood with his face bent toward her, stammering\n",
      "something in low earnest tones. There were no other people in the world\n",
      "except their two selves at that magic moment; so neither of them saw\n",
      "Anne, who, after one dazed glance of comprehension, turned and sped\n",
      "noiselessly back through the spruce wood, never stopping till she gained\n",
      "her own gable room, where she sat breathlessly down by her window and\n",
      "tried to collect her scattered wits.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Diana and Fred are in love with each other,\" she gasped. \"Oh, it does\n",
      "seem so . . . so . . . so HOPELESSLY grown up.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne, of late, had not been without her suspicions that Diana was\n",
      "proving false to the melancholy Byronic hero of her early dreams. But\n",
      "as \"things seen are mightier than things heard,\" or suspected, the\n",
      "realization that it was actually so came to her with almost the shock of\n",
      "perfect surprise. This was succeeded by a queer, little lonely feeling\n",
      ". . . as if, somehow, Diana had gone forward into a new world, shutting\n",
      "a gate behind her, leaving Anne on the outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Things are changing so fast it almost frightens me,\" Anne thought,\n",
      "a little sadly. \"And I'm afraid that this can't help making some\n",
      "difference between Diana and me. I'm sure I can't tell her all my\n",
      "secrets after this . . . she might tell Fred. And what CAN she see in\n",
      "Fred? He's very nice and jolly . . . but he's just Fred Wright.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It is always a very puzzling question . . . what can somebody see in\n",
      "somebody else? But how fortunate after all that it is so, for if\n",
      "everybody saw alike . . . well, in that case, as the old Indian said,\n",
      "\"Everybody would want my squaw.\" It was plain that Diana DID see\n",
      "something in Fred Wright, however Anne's eyes might be holden. Diana\n",
      "came to Green Gables the next evening, a pensive, shy young lady, and\n",
      "told Anne the whole story in the dusky seclusion of the east gable. Both\n",
      "girls cried and kissed and laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm so happy,\" said Diana, \"but it does seem ridiculous to think of me\n",
      "being engaged.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What is it really like to be engaged?\" asked Anne curiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, that all depends on who you're engaged to,\" answered Diana, with\n",
      "that maddening air of superior wisdom always assumed by those who are\n",
      "engaged over those who are not. \"It's perfectly lovely to be engaged to\n",
      "Fred . . . but I think it would be simply horrid to be engaged to anyone\n",
      "else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's not much comfort for the rest of us in that, seeing that there\n",
      "is only one Fred,\" laughed Anne.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Anne, you don't understand,\" said Diana in vexation. \"I didn't\n",
      "mean THAT . . . it's so hard to explain. Never mind, you'll understand\n",
      "sometime, when your own turn comes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless you, dearest of Dianas, I understand now. What is an imagination\n",
      "for if not to enable you to peep at life through other people's eyes?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "wherever you may be when I'm married.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll come from the ends of the earth if necessary,\" promised Anne\n",
      "solemnly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course, it won't be for ever so long yet,\" said Diana, blushing.\n",
      "\"Three years at the very least . . . for I'm only eighteen and mother says\n",
      "no daughter of hers shall be married before she's twenty-one. Besides,\n",
      "Fred's father is going to buy the Abraham Fletcher farm for him and he\n",
      "says he's got to have it two thirds paid for before he'll give it to him\n",
      "in his own name. But three years isn't any too much time to get ready\n",
      "for housekeeping, for I haven't a speck of fancy work made yet. But I'm\n",
      "going to begin crocheting doilies tomorrow. Myra Gillis had thirty-seven\n",
      "doilies when she was married and I'm determined I shall have as many as\n",
      "she had.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose it would be perfectly impossible to keep house with only\n",
      "thirty-six doilies,\" conceded Anne, with a solemn face but dancing eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diana looked hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I didn't think you'd make fun of me, Anne,\" she said reproachfully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dearest, I wasn't making fun of you,\" cried Anne repentantly. \"I\n",
      "was only teasing you a bit. I think you'll make the sweetest little\n",
      "housekeeper in the world. And I think it's perfectly lovely of you to be\n",
      "planning already for your home o'dreams.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne had no sooner uttered the phrase, \"home o'dreams,\" than it\n",
      "captivated her fancy and she immediately began the erection of one of\n",
      "her own. It was, of course, tenanted by an ideal master, dark, proud,\n",
      "and melancholy; but oddly enough, Gilbert Blythe persisted in hanging\n",
      "about too, helping her arrange pictures, lay out gardens, and accomplish\n",
      "sundry other tasks which a proud and melancholy hero evidently\n",
      "considered beneath his dignity. Anne tried to banish Gilbert's image\n",
      "from her castle in Spain but, somehow, he went on being there, so\n",
      "Anne, being in a hurry, gave up the attempt and pursued her aerial\n",
      "architecture with such success that her \"home o'dreams\" was built and\n",
      "furnished before Diana spoke again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I suppose, Anne, you must think it's funny I should like Fred so well\n",
      "when he's so different from the kind of man I've always said I would\n",
      "marry . . . the tall, slender kind? But somehow I wouldn't want Fred to be\n",
      "tall and slender . . . because, don't you see, he wouldn't be Fred then.\n",
      "Of course,\" added Diana rather dolefully, \"we will be a dreadfully pudgy\n",
      "couple. But after all that's better than one of us being short and fat\n",
      "and the other tall and lean, like Morgan Sloane and his wife. Mrs. Lynde\n",
      "says it always makes her think of the long and short of it when she sees\n",
      "them together.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Anne to herself that night, as she brushed her hair before\n",
      "her gilt framed mirror, \"I am glad Diana is so happy and satisfied.\n",
      "But when my turn comes . . . if it ever does . . . I do hope there'll be\n",
      "something a little more thrilling about it. But then Diana thought so\n",
      "too, once. I've heard her say time and again she'd never get engaged any\n",
      "poky commonplace way . . . he'd HAVE to do something splendid to win her.\n",
      "But she has changed. Perhaps I'll change too. But I won't . . . and\n",
      "I'm determined I won't. Oh, I think these engagements are dreadfully\n",
      "unsettling things when they happen to your intimate friends.\"\n",

      "A Wedding at the Stone House\n",
      "\n",
      "The last week in August came. Miss Lavendar was to be married in it.\n",
      "Two weeks later Anne and Gilbert would leave for Redmond College. In a\n",
      "week's time Mrs. Rachel Lynde would move to Green Gables and set up\n",
      "her lares and penates in the erstwhile spare room, which was already\n",
      "prepared for her coming. She had sold all her superfluous household\n",
      "plenishings by auction and was at present reveling in the congenial\n",
      "occupation of helping the Allans pack up. Mr. Allan was to preach his\n",
      "farewell sermon the next Sunday. The old order was changing rapidly to\n",
      "give place to the new, as Anne felt with a little sadness threading all\n",
      "her excitement and happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Changes ain't totally pleasant but they're excellent things,\" said Mr.\n",
      "Harrison philosophically. \"Two years is about long enough for things\n",
      "to stay exactly the same. If they stayed put any longer they might grow\n",
      "mossy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Harrison was smoking on his veranda. His wife had self-sacrificingly\n",
      "told that he might smoke in the house if he took care to sit by an\n",
      "open window. Mr. Harrison rewarded this concession by going outdoors\n",
      "altogether to smoke in fine weather, and so mutual goodwill reigned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne had come over to ask Mrs. Harrison for some of her yellow dahlias.\n",
      "She and Diana were going through to Echo Lodge that evening to help Miss\n",
      "Lavendar and Charlotta the Fourth with their final preparations for the\n",
      "morrow's bridal. Miss Lavendar herself never had dahlias; she did not\n",
      "like them and they would not have suited the fine retirement of her\n",
      "old-fashioned garden. But flowers of any kind were rather scarce in\n",
      "Avonlea and the neighboring districts that summer, thanks to Uncle Abe's\n",
      "storm; and Anne and Diana thought that a certain old cream-colored stone\n",
      "jug, usually kept sacred to doughnuts, brimmed over with yellow dahlias,\n",
      "would be just the thing to set in a dim angle of the stone house stairs,\n",
      "against the dark background of red hall paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I s'pose you'll be starting off for college in a fortnight's time?\"\n",
      "continued Mr. Harrison. \"Well, we're going to miss you an awful lot,\n",
      "Emily and me. To be sure, Mrs. Lynde'll be over there in your place.\n",
      "There ain't nobody but a substitute can be found for them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The irony of Mr. Harrison's tone is quite untransferable to paper. In\n",
      "spite of his wife's intimacy with Mrs. Lynde, the best that could be\n",
      "said of the relationship between her and Mr. Harrison even under the new\n",
      "regime, was that they preserved an armed neutrality.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I'm going,\" said Anne. \"I'm very glad with my head . . . and very\n",
      "sorry with my heart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I s'pose you'll be scooping up all the honors that are lying round\n",
      "loose at Redmond.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I may try for one or two of them,\" confessed Anne, \"but I don't care so\n",
      "much for things like that as I did two years ago. What I want to get out\n",
      "of my college course is some knowledge of the best way of living life\n",
      "and doing the most and best with it. I want to learn to understand and\n",
      "help other people and myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Harrison nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's the idea exactly. That's what college ought to be for, instead\n",
      "of for turning out a lot of B.A.'s, so chock full of book-learning\n",
      "and vanity that there ain't room for anything else. You're all right.\n",
      "College won't be able to do you much harm, I reckon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Diana and Anne drove over to Echo Lodge after tea, taking with them all\n",
      "the flowery spoil that several predatory expeditions in their own and\n",
      "their neighbors' gardens had yielded. They found the stone house agog\n",
      "with excitement. Charlotta the Fourth was flying around with such vim\n",
      "and briskness that her blue bows seemed really to possess the power of\n",
      "being everywhere at once. Like the helmet of Navarre, Charlotta's blue\n",
      "bows waved ever in the thickest of the fray.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Praise be to goodness you've come,\" she said devoutly, \"for there's\n",
      "heaps of things to do . . . and the frosting on that cake WON'T harden\n",
      ". . . and there's all the silver to be rubbed up yet . . .  and the\n",
      "horsehair trunk to be packed . . . and the roosters for the chicken\n",
      "salad are running out there beyant the henhouse yet, crowing, Miss\n",
      "Shirley, ma'am. And Miss Lavendar ain't to be trusted to do a thing. I\n",
      "was thankful when Mr. Irving came a few minutes ago and took her off for\n",
      "a walk in the woods. Courting's all right in its place, Miss Shirley,\n",
      "ma'am, but if you try to mix it up with cooking and scouring\n",
      "everything's spoiled. That's MY opinion, Miss Shirley, ma'am.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne and Diana worked so heartily that by ten o'clock even Charlotta\n",
      "the Fourth was satisfied. She braided her hair in innumerable plaits and\n",
      "took her weary little bones off to bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I'm sure I shan't sleep a blessed wink, Miss Shirley, ma'am, for\n",
      "fear that something'll go wrong at the last minute . . . the cream won't\n",
      "whip . . . or Mr. Irving'll have a stroke and not be able to come.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He isn't in the habit of having strokes, is he?\" asked Diana, the\n",
      "dimpled corners of her mouth twitching. To Diana, Charlotta the Fourth\n",
      "was, if not exactly a thing of beauty, certainly a joy forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They're not things that go by habit,\" said Charlotta the Fourth with\n",
      "dignity. \"They just HAPPEN . . . and there you are. ANYBODY can have a\n",
      "stroke. You don't have to learn how. Mr. Irving looks a lot like an\n",
      "uncle of mine that had one once just as he was sitting down to dinner\n",
      "one day. But maybe everything'll go all right. In this world you've just\n",
      "got to hope for the best and prepare for the worst and take whatever God\n",
      "sends.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The only thing I'm worried about is that it won't be fine tomorrow,\"\n",
      "said Diana. \"Uncle Abe predicted rain for the middle of the week, and\n",
      "ever since the big storm I can't help believing there's a good deal in\n",
      "what Uncle Abe says.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne, who knew better than Diana just how much Uncle Abe had to do with\n",
      "the storm, was not much disturbed by this. She slept the sleep of the\n",
      "just and weary, and was roused at an unearthly hour by Charlotta the\n",
      "Fourth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, Miss Shirley, ma'am, it's awful to call you so early,\" came wailing\n",
      "through the keyhole, \"but there's so much to do yet . . . and oh, Miss\n",
      "Shirley, ma'am, I'm skeered it's going to rain and I wish you'd get up\n",
      "and tell me you think it ain't.\" Anne flew to the window, hoping against\n",
      "hope that Charlotta the Fourth was saying this merely by way of rousing\n",
      "her effectually. But alas, the morning did look unpropitious. Below the\n",
      "window Miss Lavendar's garden, which should have been a glory of pale\n",
      "virgin sunshine, lay dim and windless; and the sky over the firs was\n",
      "dark with moody clouds.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Isn't it too mean!\" said Diana.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We must hope for the best,\" said Anne determinedly. \"If it only doesn't\n",
      "actually rain, a cool, pearly gray day like this would really be nicer\n",
      "than hot sunshine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But it will rain,\" mourned Charlotta, creeping into the room, a figure\n",
      "of fun, with her many braids wound about her head, the ends, tied up\n",
      "with white thread, sticking out in all directions. \"It'll hold off till\n",
      "the last minute and then pour cats and dogs. And all the folks will get\n",
      "sopping . . . and track mud all over the house . . . and they won't be\n",
      "able to be married under the honeysuckle . . . and it's awful unlucky\n",
      "for no sun to shine on a bride, say what you will, Miss Shirley, ma'am.\n",
      "_I_ knew things were going too well to last.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Charlotta the Fourth seemed certainly to have borrowed a leaf out of\n",
      "Miss Eliza Andrews' book.\n",
      "\n",
      "It did not rain, though it kept on looking as if it meant to. By noon\n",
      "the rooms were decorated, the table beautifully laid; and upstairs was\n",
      "waiting a bride, \"adorned for her husband.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You do look sweet,\" said Anne rapturously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lovely,\" echoed Diana.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Everything's ready, Miss Shirley, ma'am, and nothing dreadful has\n",
      "happened YET,\" was Charlotta's cheerful statement as she betook herself\n",
      "to her little back room to dress. Out came all the braids; the resultant\n",
      "rampant crinkliness was plaited into two tails and tied, not with two\n",
      "bows alone, but with four, of brand-new ribbon, brightly blue. The two\n",
      "upper bows rather gave the impression of overgrown wings sprouting from\n",
      "Charlotta's neck, somewhat after the fashion of Raphael's cherubs. But\n",
      "Charlotta the Fourth thought them very beautiful, and after she had\n",
      "rustled into a white dress, so stiffly starched that it could stand\n",
      "alone, she surveyed herself in her glass with great satisfaction . . . a\n",
      "satisfaction which lasted until she went out in the hall and caught\n",

      "inner consciousness had been lifted, giving to her view a revelation of\n",
      "unsuspected feelings and realities. Perhaps, after all, romance did not\n",
      "come into one's life with pomp and blare, like a gay knight riding down;\n",
      "perhaps it crept to one's side like an old friend through quiet ways;\n",
      "perhaps it revealed itself in seeming prose, until some sudden shaft of\n",

      "in time a son was born the infant's feet were riveted together and he\n",

      "tended him, and delivered him to another shepherd who took him to his\n",
      "master, the King of Corinth. Polybus being childless adopted the boy,\n",
      "who grew up believing that he was indeed the King's son. Afterwards\n",
      "doubting his parentage he inquired of the Delphic god and heard himself\n",
      "the word declared before to Laius. Wherefore he fled from what he\n",
      "deemed his father's house and in his flight he encountered and\n",
      "unwillingly slew his father Laius. Arriving at Thebes he answered the\n",
      "riddle of the Sphinx and the grateful Thebans made their deliverer king.\n",
      "So he reigned in the room of Laius, and espoused the widowed queen.\n",
      "Children were born to them and Thebes prospered under his rule, but\n",
      "again a grievous plague fell upon the city. Again the oracle was\n",
      "consulted and it bade them purge themselves of blood-guiltiness. Oedipus\n",
      "denounces the crime of which he is unaware, and undertakes to track out\n",
      "the criminal. Step by step it is brought home to him that he is the man.\n",

      "    The Song of Hiawatha is based on the legends and stories of\n",
      "many North American Indian tribes, but especially those of the\n",
      "Ojibway Indians of northern Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.\n",
      "They were collected by Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, the reknowned\n",
      "historian, pioneer explorer, and geologist.  He was superintendent\n",
      "of Indian affairs for Michigan from 1836 to 1841.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Schoolcraft married Jane, O-bah-bahm-wawa-ge-zhe-go-qua (The\n",

      "fur trader, and O-shau-gus-coday-way-qua (The Woman of the Green\n",

      "who was Chief of the Ojibway tribe at La Pointe, Wisconsin.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Jane and her mother are credited with having researched,\n",
      "authenticated, and compiled much of the material Schoolcraft\n",
      "included in his Algic Researches (1839) and a revision published\n",
      "in 1856 as The Myth of Hiawatha.  It was this latter revision\n",
      "that Longfellow used as the basis for The Song of Hiawatha.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Longfellow began Hiawatha on June 25, 1854, he completed it\n",
      "on March 29, 1855, and it was published November 10, 1855.  As\n",
      "soon as the poem was  published its popularity was assured.\n",
      "However, it also was severely criticized as a plagiary of the\n",
      "Finnish epic poem Kalevala.  Longfellow made no secret of the\n",
      "fact that he had used the meter of the Kalevala; but as for the\n",
      "legends, he openly gave credit to Schoolcraft in his notes to the\n",

A. Harrison's house\", 'like a great white mountain, was far away in a delicious world where a', 'certain schoolteacher was doing a wonderful work, shaping the destinies', 'of future statesmen, and inspiring youthful minds and hearts with high', 'and lofty ambitions.', 'To be sure, if you came down to harsh facts . . . which, it must be', 'confessed, Anne seldom did until she had to . . . it did not seem likely', 'that there was much promising material for celebrities in Avonlea', 'school; but you could never tell what might happen if a teacher used', 'her influence for good. Anne had certain rose-tinted ideals of what a', 'teacher might accomplish if she only went the right way about it; and', 'she was in the midst of a delightful scene, forty years hence, with a', 'famous personage . . . just exactly what he was to be famous for was left', 'in convenient haziness, but Anne thought it would be rather nice to have', 'him a college president or a Canadian premier . . . bowing low over her', 'wrinkled hand and assuring her that it was she who had first kindled his', 'ambition, and that all his success in life was due to the lessons she', 'had instilled so long ago in Avonlea school. This pleasant vision was', 'shattered by a most unpleasant interruption.', 'A demure little Jersey cow came scuttling down the lane and five seconds', 'later Mr. Harrison arrived . . . if \"arrived\" be not too mild a term to', 'describe the manner of his irruption into the yard.', 'He bounced over the fence without waiting to open the gate, and angrily', 'confronted astonished Anne, who had risen to her feet and stood looking', 'at him in some bewilderment. Mr. Harrison was their new righthand', 'neighbor and she had never met him before, although she had seen him', 'once or twice.', \"In early April, before Anne had come home from Queen's, Mr. Robert Bell,\", 'whose farm adjoined the Cuthbert place on the west, had sold out and', 'moved to Charlottetown. His farm had been bought by a certain Mr. J. A.', 'Harrison, whose name, and the fact that he was a New Brunswick man, were', 'all that was known about him. But before he had been a month in Avonlea', 'he had won the reputation of being an odd person . . . \"a crank,\" Mrs.', 'Rachel Lynde said. Mrs. Rachel was an outspoken lady, as those of you', 'who may have already made her acquaintance will remember. Mr. Harrison', 'was certainly different from other people . . . and that is the essential', 'characteristic of a crank, as everybody knows.', 'In the first place he kept house for himself and had publicly stated', 'that he wanted no fools of women around his diggings. Feminine', 'Avonlea took its revenge by the gruesome tales it related about his', 'house-keeping and cooking. He had hired little John Henry Carter of', 'White Sands and John Henry started the stories. For one thing, there', 'was never any stated time for meals in the Harrison establishment. Mr.', 'Harrison \"got a bite\" when he felt hungry, and if John Henry were around', 'at the time, he came in for a share, but if he were not, he had to wait', \"until Mr. Harrison's next hungry spell. John Henry mournfully averred\", \"that he would have starved to death if it wasn't that he got home on\", 'Sundays and got a good filling up, and that his mother always gave him a', 'basket of \"grub\" to take back with him on Monday mornings.', 'As for washing dishes, Mr. Harrison never made any pretence of doing it', 'unless a rainy Sunday came. Then he went to work and washed them all at', 'once in the rainwater hogshead, and left them to drain dry.', 'Again, Mr. Harrison was \"close.\" When he was asked to subscribe to the', \"Rev. Mr. Allan's salary he said he'd wait and see how many dollars'\", \"worth of good he got out of his preaching first . . . he didn't believe\", 'in buying a pig in a poke. And when Mrs. Lynde went to ask for a', 'contribution to missions . . . and incidentally to see the inside of', 'the house . . . he told her there were more heathens among the old woman', \"gossips in Avonlea than anywhere else he knew of, and he'd cheerfully\", \"contribute to a mission for Christianizing them if she'd undertake it.\", 'Mrs. Rachel got herself away and said it was a mercy poor Mrs. Robert', 'Bell was safe in her grave, for it would have broken her heart to see', 'the state of her house in which she used to take so much pride.', '\"Why, she scrubbed the kitchen floor every second day,\" Mrs. Lynde told', 'Marilla Cuthbert indignantly, \"and if you could see it now! I had to', 'hold up my skirts as I walked across it.\"', 'Finally, Mr. Harrison kept a parrot called Ginger. Nobody in Avonlea had', 'ever kept a parrot before; consequently that proceeding was considered', \"barely respectable. And such a parrot! If you took John Henry Carter's\", 'word for it, never was such an unholy bird. It swore terribly. Mrs.', 'Carter would have taken John Henry away at once if she had been sure', 'she could get another place for him. Besides, Ginger had bitten a piece', \"right out of the back of John Henry's neck one day when he had stooped\", 'down too near the cage. Mrs. Carter showed everybody the mark when the', 'luckless John Henry went home on Sundays.', \"All these things flashed through Anne's mind as Mr. Harrison stood,\", 'quite speechless with wrath apparently, before her. In his most amiable', 'mood Mr. Harrison could not have been considered a handsome man; he was', 'short and fat and bald; and now, with his round face purple with rage', 'and his prominent blue eyes almost sticking out of his head, Anne', 'thought he was really the ugliest person she had ever seen.', 'All at once Mr. Harrison found his voice.', '\"I\\'m not going to put up with this,\" he spluttered, \"not a day longer,', 'do you hear, miss. Bless my soul, this is the third time, miss . . .  the', 'third time! Patience has ceased to be a virtue, miss.

That', 'is what I\\'m here about, miss.\"', '\"Will you explain what the trouble is?\" asked Anne, in her most', 'dignified manner. She had been practicing it considerably of late to', 'have it in good working order when school began; but it had no apparent', 'effect on the irate J. A. Harrison.', '\"Trouble, is it? Bless my soul, trouble enough, I should think. The', \"trouble is, miss, that I found that Jersey cow of your aunt's in my oats\", 'again, not half an hour ago. The third time, mark you.

Harrison\\'s mind, miss.\"', '\"If you mean Miss Marilla Cuthbert, she is not my aunt, and she has gone', 'down to East Grafton to see a distant relative of hers who is very ill,\"', 'said Anne, with due increase of dignity at every word. \"I am very sorry', 'that my cow should have broken into your oats . . .  she is my cow and not', \"Miss Cuthbert's . . . Matthew gave her to me three years ago when she was\", 'a little calf and he bought her from Mr. Bell.\"', '\"Sorry, miss! Sorry isn\\'t going to help matters any. You\\'d better go and', 'look at the havoc that animal has made in my oats . . . trampled them from', 'center to circumference, miss.\"', '\"I am very sorry,\" repeated Anne firmly, \"but perhaps if you kept your', 'fences in better repair Dolly might not have broken in. It is your part', 'of the line fence that separates your oatfield from our pasture and I', 'noticed the other day that it was not in very good condition.\"', '\"My fence is all right,\" snapped Mr. Harrison, angrier than ever at this', 'carrying of the war into the enemy\\'s country. \"The jail fence couldn\\'t', 'keep a demon of a cow like that out.

She could hardly believe the evidence of her senses.', 'Mr. Harrison had brought Ginger back, averring that the poor bird would', 'be lonesome; and Anne, feeling that she could forgive everybody and', \"everything, offered him a walnut.

Maybe it had some reference to his', \"temper. I think a lot of that bird though . . . you'd be surprised if you\", 'knew how much. He has his faults of course.

I\\'m sure it wouldn\\'t do any good. Oh,', 'don\\'t whip your pupils, Jane dear, no matter what they do.\"', '\"What do you think about it, Gilbert?\" demanded Jane. \"Don\\'t you think', 'there are some children who really need a whipping now and then?\"', '\"Don\\'t you think it\\'s a cruel, barbarous thing to whip a child . . .  ANY', 'child?\" exclaimed Anne, her face flushing with earnestness.', '\"Well,\" said Gilbert slowly, torn between his real convictions and his', 'wish to measure up to Anne\\'s ideal, \"there\\'s something to be said on', \"both sides. I don't believe in whipping children MUCH. I think, as you\", 'say, Anne, that there are better ways of managing as a rule, and that', 'corporal punishment should be a last resort.

Once', 'upon a time, Anne had been made to sit with Gilbert for punishment and', 'sad and bitter had been the consequences thereof.', '\"Well, time will tell which is the best way,\" said Jane philosophically', 'as they parted.', 'Anne went back to Green Gables by way of Birch Path, shadowy, rustling,', 'fern-scented, through Violet Vale and past Willowmere, where dark and', \"light kissed each other under the firs, and down through Lover's Lane\", '. . . spots she and Diana had so named long ago.

He certainly never paid her any to her face.', '\"Well, I suppose you\\'ve been back in the woods laying in a supply of', 'switches for tomorrow?\" was his greeting as Anne came up the veranda', 'steps.', '\"No, indeed,\" said Anne indignantly. She was an excellent target for', 'teasing because she always took things so seriously. \"I shall never have', 'a switch in my school, Mr. Harrison.

The preceding teacher had trained the', 'children to be in their places at her arrival, and when Anne entered the', 'schoolroom she was confronted by prim rows of \"shining morning faces\"', 'and bright, inquisitive eyes. She hung up her hat and faced her pupils,', 'hoping that she did not look as frightened and foolish as she felt and', 'that they would not perceive how she was trembling.', 'She had sat up until nearly twelve the preceding night composing a', 'speech she meant to make to her pupils upon opening the school. She had', 'revised and improved it painstakingly, and then she had learned it off', 'by heart. It was a very good speech and had some very fine ideas in it,', 'especially about mutual help and earnest striving after knowledge. The', 'only trouble was that she could not now remember a word of it.', 'After what seemed to her a year . . . about ten seconds in reality . . .', 'she said faintly, \"Take your Testaments, please,\" and sank breathlessly', 'into her chair under cover of the rustle and clatter of desk lids that', 'followed. While the children read their verses Anne marshalled her shaky', 'wits into order and looked over the array of little pilgrims to the', 'Grownup Land.', 'Most of them were, of course, quite well known to her. Her own', 'classmates had passed out in the preceding year but the rest had all', 'gone to school with her, excepting the primer class and ten newcomers', 'to Avonlea. Anne secretly felt more interest in these ten than in those', 'whose possibilities were already fairly well mapped out to her. To be', 'sure, they might be just as commonplace as the rest; but on the other', 'hand there MIGHT be a genius among them. It was a thrilling idea.', 'Sitting by himself at a corner desk was Anthony Pye. He had a dark,', 'sullen little face, and was staring at Anne with a hostile expression in', 'his black eyes. Anne instantly made up her mind that she would win that', \"boy's affection and discomfit the Pyes utterly.\", 'In the other corner another strange boy was sitting with Arty Sloane. . .', 'a jolly looking little chap, with a snub nose, freckled face, and big,', 'light blue eyes, fringed with whitish lashes . . .  probably the DonNELL', 'boy; and if resemblance went for anything, his sister was sitting across', 'the aisle with Mary Bell. Anne wondered what sort of mother the child', 'had, to send her to school dressed as she was. She wore a faded pink', 'silk dress, trimmed with a great deal of cotton lace, soiled white', 'kid slippers, and silk stockings. Her sandy hair was tortured into', 'innumerable kinky and unnatural curls, surmounted by a flamboyant bow', 'of pink ribbon bigger than her head. Judging from her expression she was', 'very well satisfied with herself.', 'A pale little thing, with smooth ripples of fine, silky, fawn-colored', 'hair flowing over her shoulders, must, Anne thought, be Annetta Bell,', 'whose parents had formerly lived in the Newbridge school district, but,', 'by reason of hauling their house fifty yards north of its old site were', 'now in Avonlea. Three pallid little girls crowded into one seat were', 'certainly Cottons; and there was no doubt that the small beauty with', 'the long brown curls and hazel eyes, who was casting coquettish looks at', 'Jack Gills over the edge of her Testament, was Prillie Rogerson, whose', 'father had recently married a second wife and brought Prillie home from', \"her grandmother's in Grafton. A tall, awkward girl in a back seat, who\", 'seemed to have too many feet and hands, Anne could not place at all, but', 'later on discovered that her name was Barbara Shaw and that she had come', 'to live with an Avonlea aunt. She was also to find that if Barbara ever', 'managed to walk down the aisle without falling over her own or somebody', \"else's feet the Avonlea scholars wrote the unusual fact up on the porch\", 'wall to commemorate it.', \"But when Anne's eyes met those of the boy at the front desk facing\", 'her own, a queer little thrill went over her, as if she had found her', 'genius. She knew this must be Paul Irving and that Mrs. Rachel Lynde', 'had been right for once when she prophesied that he would be unlike the', 'Avonlea children. More than that, Anne realized that he was unlike other', 'children anywhere, and that there was a soul subtly akin to her own', 'gazing at her out of the very dark blue eyes that were watching her so', 'intently.', 'She knew Paul was ten but he looked no more than eight. He had the most', 'beautiful little face she had ever seen in a child . . .  features of', 'exquisite delicacy and refinement, framed in a halo of chestnut curls.', 'His mouth was delicious, being full without pouting, the crimson lips', 'just softly touching and curving into finely finished little corners', 'that narrowly escaped being dimpled. He had a sober, grave, meditative', 'expression, as if his spirit was much older than his body; but when', 'Anne smiled softly at him it vanished in a sudden answering smile, which', 'seemed an illumination of his whole being, as if some lamp had suddenly', 'kindled into flame inside of him, irradiating him from top to toe. Best', 'of all, it was involuntary, born of no external effort or motive, but', 'simply the outflashing of a hidden personality, rare and fine and sweet.', 'With a quick interchange of smiles Anne and Paul were fast friends', 'forever before a word had passed between them.', 'The day went by like a dream. Anne could never clearly recall it', 'afterwards. It almost seemed as if it were not she who was teaching', 'but somebody else. She heard classes and worked sums and set copies', 'mechanically. The children behaved quite well; only two cases of', 'discipline occurred. Morley Andrews was caught driving a pair of trained', 'crickets in the aisle. Anne stood Morley on the platform for an', 'hour and . . . which Morley felt much more keenly . . .  confiscated his', 'crickets. She put them in a box and on the way from school set them free', 'in Violet Vale; but Morley believed, then and ever afterwards, that she', 'took them home and kept them for her own amusement.', 'The other culprit was Anthony Pye, who poured the last drops of water', \"from his slate bottle down the back of Aurelia Clay's neck. Anne kept\", 'Anthony in at recess and talked to him about what was expected of', \"gentlemen, admonishing him that they never poured water down ladies'\", 'necks. She wanted all her boys to be gentlemen, she said. Her little', 'lecture was quite kind and touching; but unfortunately Anthony remained', 'absolutely untouched. He listened to her in silence, with the same', 'sullen expression, and whistled scornfully as he went out. Anne', \"sighed; and then cheered herself up by remembering that winning a Pye's\", \"affections, like the building of Rome, wasn't the work of a day. In\", 'fact, it was doubtful whether some of the Pyes had any affections to', 'win; but Anne hoped better things of Anthony, who looked as if he might', 'be a rather nice boy if one ever got behind his sullenness.', 'When school was dismissed and the children had gone Anne dropped wearily', 'into her chair. Her head ached and she felt woefully discouraged. There', 'was no real reason for discouragement, since nothing very dreadful had', 'occurred; but Anne was very tired and inclined to believe that she would', 'never learn to like teaching. And how terrible it would be to be doing', \"something you didn't like every day for . . . well, say forty years. Anne\", 'was of two minds whether to have her cry out then and there, or wait', 'till she was safely in her own white room at home. Before she could', 'decide there was a click of heels and a silken swish on the porch floor,', 'and Anne found herself confronted by a lady whose appearance made her', \"recall a recent criticism of Mr. Harrison's on an overdressed female he\", 'had seen in a Charlottetown store. \"She looked like a head-on collision', 'between a fashion plate and a nightmare.\"', 'The newcomer was gorgeously arrayed in a pale blue summer silk, puffed,', 'frilled, and shirred wherever puff, frill, or shirring could possibly', 'be placed.

A veil of pink', 'chiffon, lavishly sprinkled with huge black dots, hung like a flounce', 'from the hat brim to her shoulders and floated off in two airy streamers', 'behind her. She wore all the jewelry that could be crowded on one small', 'woman, and a very strong odor of perfume attended her.', '\"I am Mrs. DonNELL . . . Mrs. H. B.

Mr. Elisha Wright was', 'reported to have said that a more appropriate name for the organization', 'would be Courting Club. Mrs. Hiram Sloane declared she had heard the', 'Improvers meant to plough up all the roadsides and set them out with', 'geraniums. Mr. Levi Boulter warned his neighbors that the Improvers', 'would insist that everybody pull down his house and rebuild it after', 'plans approved by the society. Mr. James Spencer sent them word that he', 'wished they would kindly shovel down the church hill. Eben Wright told', 'Anne that he wished the Improvers could induce old Josiah Sloane to', 'keep his whiskers trimmed. Mr. Lawrence Bell said he would whitewash', 'his barns if nothing else would please them but he would NOT hang lace', 'curtains in the cowstable windows. Mr. Major Spencer asked Clifton', 'Sloane, an Improver who drove the milk to the Carmody cheese factory,', 'if it was true that everybody would have to have his milk-stand', 'hand-painted next summer and keep an embroidered centerpiece on it.', 'In spite of . . . or perhaps, human nature being what it is, because of', '. . . this, the Society went gamely to work at the only improvement they', 'could hope to bring about that fall. At the second meeting, in the Barry', 'parlor, Oliver Sloane moved that they start a subscription to re-shingle', 'and paint the hall; Julia Bell seconded it, with an uneasy feeling that', 'she was doing something not exactly ladylike. Gilbert put the motion,', 'it was carried unanimously, and Anne gravely recorded it in her minutes.', 'The next thing was to appoint a committee, and Gertie Pye, determined', 'not to let Julia Bell carry off all the laurels, boldly moved that Miss', 'Jane Andrews be chairman of said committee.

Anne's tickled\", 'to death over the whole business, and she has a real knacky way with', \"children, I must say. Dear me, it doesn't seem a day since poor Matthew\", 'brought Anne herself home and everybody laughed at the idea of Marilla', \"bringing up a child. And now she has adopted twins. You're never safe\", 'from being surprised till you\\'re dead.\"', \"The fat pony jogged over the bridge in Lynde's Hollow and along the\", \"Green Gables lane. Marilla's face was rather grim. It was ten miles from\", 'East Grafton and Davy Keith seemed to be possessed with a passion for', \"perpetual motion. It was beyond Marilla's power to make him sit still\", 'and she had been in an agony the whole way lest he fall over the back', 'of the wagon and break his neck, or tumble over the dashboard under the', \"pony's heels. In despair she finally threatened to whip him soundly when\", 'she got him home. Whereupon Davy climbed into her lap, regardless of', 'the reins, flung his chubby arms about her neck and gave her a bear-like', 'hug.', '\"I don\\'t believe you mean it,\" he said, smacking her wrinkled cheek', 'affectionately. \"You don\\'t LOOK like a lady who\\'d whip a little boy just', \"'cause he couldn't keep still.

Here, Dora, let me liven you up a bit.\"', 'Davy\\'s method of \"livening up\" was to grasp Dora\\'s curls in his fingers', 'and give them a tug.

It had been a hard', 'day for her, what with the funeral and the long drive. At that moment', 'she looked forward to the future with a pessimism that would have done', 'credit to Eliza Andrews herself.', 'The twins were not noticeably alike, although both were fair. Dora had', 'long sleek curls that never got out of order. Davy had a crop of fuzzy', \"little yellow ringlets all over his round head.

Mirth and mischief lurked in every corner', 'of his little face.', '\"They\\'d better go to bed,\" said Marilla, who thought it was the easiest', 'way to dispose of them. \"Dora will sleep with me and you can put Davy in', 'the west gable.

He trotted obediently', 'upstairs with Anne.', '\"When I\\'m grown up the very first thing I\\'m going to do is stay up ALL', 'night just to see what it would be like,\" he told her confidentially.', \"In after years Marilla never thought of that first week of the twins'\", 'sojourn at Green Gables without a shiver. Not that it really was so much', 'worse than the weeks that followed it; but it seemed so by reason of its', 'novelty. There was seldom a waking minute of any day when Davy was not', 'in mischief or devising it; but his first notable exploit occurred two', 'days after his arrival, on Sunday morning . . . a fine, warm day, as', 'hazy and mild as September. Anne dressed him for church while Marilla', 'attended to Dora. Davy at first objected strongly to having his face', 'washed.', '\"Marilla washed it yesterday . . . and Mrs. Wiggins scoured me with hard', \"soap the day of the funeral. That's enough for one week.

The same consideration induced him', 'to submit meekly to the other details of his toilet, and he was really', 'a handsome little lad when all was done. Anne felt an almost maternal', 'pride in him as she led him into the old Cuthbert pew.', 'Davy behaved quite well at first, being occupied in casting covert', 'glances at all the small boys within view and wondering which was', 'Paul Irving. The first two hymns and the Scripture reading passed off', 'uneventfully. Mr. Allan was praying when the sensation came.', 'Lauretta White was sitting in front of Davy, her head slightly bent', 'and her fair hair hanging in two long braids, between which a tempting', 'expanse of white neck showed, encased in a loose lace frill. Lauretta', 'was a fat, placid-looking child of eight, who had conducted herself', 'irreproachably in church from the very first day her mother carried her', 'there, an infant of six months.', 'Davy thrust his hand into his pocket and produced . . . a caterpillar, a', 'furry, squirming caterpillar. Marilla saw and clutched at him but she', \"was too late. Davy dropped the caterpillar down Lauretta's neck.\", \"Right into the middle of Mr. Allan's prayer burst a series of piercing\", 'shrieks.

Her shrieks died away in the distance and Mr.', 'Allan proceeded with the service. But everybody felt that it was a', 'failure that day. For the first time in her life Marilla took no notice', 'of the text and Anne sat with scarlet cheeks of mortification.', 'When they got home Marilla put Davy to bed and made him stay there for', 'the rest of the day. She would not give him any dinner but allowed him a', 'plain tea of bread and milk. Anne carried it to him and sat sorrowfully', \"by him while he ate it with an unrepentant relish.

Then she returned', 'to the kitchen, just as Marilla came grimly in, leading, or rather', 'pulling, the reluctant, cobwebby Davy, whom she had just found hidden', 'away in the darkest corner of the stable.', 'She jerked him to the mat on the middle of the floor and then went and', 'sat down by the east window.

Don\\'t you, Jane?\"', '\"I . . . I don\\'t know,\" said Jane uncomfortably. Jane was a good girl,', 'a member of the church, who tried conscientiously to live up to her', 'profession and believed everything she had been taught.

Then', 'more wild cherries, and a little valley of lissome firs, and then a hill', 'so steep that the girls lost their breath climbing it; but when they', 'reached the top and came out into the open the prettiest surprise of all', 'awaited them.', 'Beyond were the \"back fields\" of the farms that ran out to the upper', 'Carmody road. Just before them, hemmed in by beeches and firs but open', 'to the south, was a little corner and in it a garden  . . . or what had', 'once been a garden. A tumbledown stone dyke, overgrown with mosses and', 'grass, surrounded it. Along the eastern side ran a row of garden cherry', 'trees, white as a snowdrift. There were traces of old paths still and', 'a double line of rosebushes through the middle; but all the rest of the', 'space was a sheet of yellow and white narcissi, in their airiest, most', 'lavish, wind-swayed bloom above the lush green grasses.', '\"Oh, how perfectly lovely!\" three of the girls cried. Anne only gazed in', 'eloquent silence.', '\"How in the world does it happen that there ever was a garden back', 'here?\" said Priscilla in amazement.', '\"It must be Hester Gray\\'s garden,\" said Diana. \"I\\'ve heard mother speak', \"of it but I never saw it before, and I wouldn't have supposed that it\", 'could be in existence still. You\\'ve heard the story, Anne?\"', '\"No, but the name seems familiar to me.\"', '\"Oh, you\\'ve seen it in the graveyard. She is buried down there in the', 'poplar corner. You know the little brown stone with the opening gates', \"carved on it and 'Sacred to the memory of Hester Gray, aged twenty-two.'\", \"Jordan Gray is buried right beside her but there's no stone to him. It's\", 'a wonder Marilla never told you about it, Anne. To be sure, it happened', 'thirty years ago and everybody has forgotten.\"', '\"Well, if there\\'s a story we must have it,\" said Anne. \"Let\\'s sit right', 'down here among the narcissi and Diana will tell it. Why, girls, there', \"are hundreds of them . . . they've spread over everything. It looks as if\", 'the garden were carpeted with moonshine and sunshine combined. This is', \"a discovery worth making. To think that I've lived within a mile of this\", 'place for six years and have never seen it before! Now, Diana.\"', '\"Long ago,\" began Diana, \"this farm belonged to old Mr. David Gray. He', \"didn't live on it . . . he lived where Silas Sloane lives now. He had one\", 'son, Jordan, and he went up to Boston one winter to work and while', 'he was there he fell in love with a girl named Hester Murray. She', \"was working in a store and she hated it. She'd been brought up in the\", 'country and she always wanted to get back. When Jordan asked her to', \"marry him she said she would if he'd take her away to some quiet spot\", \"where she'd see nothing but fields and trees. So he brought her to\", 'Avonlea. Mrs. Lynde said he was taking a fearful risk in marrying a', \"Yankee, and it's certain that Hester was very delicate and a very poor\", 'housekeeper; but mother says she was very pretty and sweet and Jordan', 'just worshipped the ground she walked on. Well, Mr. Gray gave Jordan', 'this farm and he built a little house back here and Jordan and Hester', 'lived in it for four years. She never went out much and hardly anybody', 'went to see her except mother and Mrs. Lynde. Jordan made her this', 'garden and she was crazy about it and spent most of her time in it. She', \"wasn't much of a housekeeper but she had a knack with flowers. And then\", 'she got sick. Mother says she thinks she was in consumption before she', 'ever came here. She never really laid up but just grew weaker and weaker', \"all the time. Jordan wouldn't have anybody to wait on her. He did it all\", 'himself and mother says he was as tender and gentle as a woman. Every', \"day he'd wrap her in a shawl and carry her out to the garden and she'd\", 'lie there on a bench quite happy. They say she used to make Jordan kneel', 'down by her every night and morning and pray with her that she might die', 'out in the garden when the time came. And her prayer was answered. One', 'day Jordan carried her out to the bench and then he picked all the roses', 'that were out and heaped them over her; and she just smiled up at him', '. . . and closed her eyes . . . and that,\" concluded Diana softly, \"was', 'the end.\"', '\"Oh, what a dear story,\" sighed Anne, wiping away her tears.', '\"What became of Jordan?\" asked Priscilla.', '\"He sold the farm after Hester died and went back to Boston. Mr. Jabez', 'Sloane bought the farm and hauled the little house out to the road.', 'Jordan died about ten years after and he was brought home and buried', 'beside Hester.\"', '\"I can\\'t understand how she could have wanted to live back here, away', 'from everything,\" said Jane.', '\"Oh, I can easily understand THAT,\" said Anne thoughtfully. \"I wouldn\\'t', 'want it myself for a steady thing, because, although I love the fields', 'and woods, I love people too. But I can understand it in Hester. She', 'was tired to death of the noise of the big city and the crowds of people', 'always coming and going and caring nothing for her. She just wanted to', 'escape from it all to some still, green, friendly place where she could', 'rest. And she got just what she wanted, which is something very few', 'people do, I believe. She had four beautiful years before she died. . .', 'four years of perfect happiness, so I think she was to be envied more', 'than pitied. And then to shut your eyes and fall asleep among roses,', 'with the one you loved best on earth smiling down at you . . . oh, I think', 'it was beautiful!\"', '\"She set out those cherry trees over there,\" said Diana. \"She told', \"mother she'd never live to eat their fruit, but she wanted to think that\", 'something she had planted would go on living and helping to make the', 'world beautiful after she was dead.\"', '\"I\\'m so glad we came this way,\" said Anne, the shining-eyed. \"This is', 'my adopted birthday, you know, and this garden and its story is the', 'birthday gift it has given me. Did your mother ever tell you what Hester', 'Gray looked like, Diana?\"', '\"No . . . only just that she was pretty.\"', '\"I\\'m rather glad of that, because I can imagine what she looked like,', 'without being hampered by facts. I think she was very slight and small,', 'with softly curling dark hair and big, sweet, timid brown eyes, and a', 'little wistful, pale face.\"', \"The girls left their baskets in Hester's garden and spent the rest\", 'of the afternoon rambling in the woods and fields surrounding it,', 'discovering many pretty nooks and lanes. When they got hungry they had', 'lunch in the prettiest spot of all . . . on the steep bank of a gurgling', 'brook where white birches shot up out of long feathery grasses. The', \"girls sat down by the roots and did full justice to Anne's dainties,\", 'even the unpoetical sandwiches being greatly appreciated by hearty,', 'unspoiled appetites sharpened by all the fresh air and exercise they had', 'enjoyed. Anne had brought glasses and lemonade for her guests, but for', 'her own part drank cold brook water from a cup fashioned out of birch', 'bark. The cup leaked, and the water tasted of earth, as brook water', 'is apt to do in spring; but Anne thought it more appropriate to the', 'occasion than lemonade.', '\"Look do you see that poem?\" she said suddenly, pointing.', '\"Where?\" Jane and Diana stared, as if expecting to see Runic rhymes on', 'the birch trees.', '\"There . . . down in the brook . . . that old green, mossy log with the', \"water flowing over it in those smooth ripples that look as if they'd\", 'been combed, and that single shaft of sunshine falling right athwart it,', 'far down into the pool. Oh, it\\'s the most beautiful poem I ever saw.\"', '\"I should rather call it a picture,\" said Jane. \"A poem is lines and', 'verses.\"', '\"Oh dear me, no.\" Anne shook her head with its fluffy wild cherry', 'coronal positively. \"The lines and verses are only the outward garments', 'of the poem and are no more really it than your ruffles and flounces are', 'YOU, Jane.

And', 'some are all shot through with rosy stains and quivers . . . and some', 'have a soft glitter like moonlight on the sea . . . and some are pale and', 'transparent like mist at dawn.\"', '\"I read somewhere once that souls were like flowers,\" said Priscilla.', '\"Then your soul is a golden narcissus,\" said Anne, \"and Diana\\'s is like', \"a red, red rose. Jane's is an apple blossom, pink and wholesome and\", 'sweet.\"', '\"And your own is a white violet, with purple streaks in its heart,\"', 'finished Priscilla.', 'Jane whispered to Diana that she really could not understand what they', 'were talking about.

Do you think it would be any harm?\"', '\"No, I don\\'t think so,\" decided Anne, after due reflection, \"since our', 'motive is not idle curiosity.\"', 'This important point of ethics being settled, Anne prepared to mount the', 'aforesaid \"little house,\" a construction of lathes, with a peaked roof,', 'which had in times past served as a habitation for ducks. The Copp girls', 'had given up keeping ducks . . . \"because they were such untidy birds\". .', '. and the house had not been in use for some years, save as an abode of', 'correction for setting hens. Although scrupulously whitewashed it had', 'become somewhat shaky, and Anne felt rather dubious as she scrambled up', 'from the vantage point of a keg placed on a box.', '\"I\\'m afraid it won\\'t bear my weight,\" she said as she gingerly stepped', 'on the roof.', '\"Lean on the window sill,\" advised Diana, and Anne accordingly leaned.', 'Much to her delight, she saw, as she peered through the pane, a', 'willow-ware platter, exactly such as she was in quest of, on the shelf', 'in front of the window. So much she saw before the catastrophe came. In', 'her joy Anne forgot the precarious nature of her footing, incautiously', 'ceased to lean on the window sill, gave an impulsive little hop of', 'pleasure . . . and the next moment she had crashed through the roof up', 'to her armpits, and there she hung, quite unable to extricate herself.', 'Diana dashed into the duck house and, seizing her unfortunate friend by', 'the waist, tried to draw her down.', '\"Ow . . . don\\'t,\" shrieked poor Anne. \"There are some long splinters', 'sticking into me. See if you can put something under my feet . . . then', 'perhaps I can draw myself up.\"', 'Diana hastily dragged in the previously mentioned keg and Anne found', 'that it was just sufficiently high to furnish a secure resting place for', 'her feet. But she could not release herself.', '\"Could I pull you out if I crawled up?\" suggested Diana.', 'Anne shook her head hopelessly.', '\"No . . . the splinters hurt too badly. If you can find an axe you might', 'chop me out, though. Oh dear, I do really begin to believe that I was', 'born under an ill-omened star.\"', 'Diana searched faithfully but no axe was to be found.', '\"I\\'ll have to go for help,\" she said, returning to the prisoner.', '\"No, indeed, you won\\'t,\" said Anne vehemently. \"If you do the story of', 'this will get out everywhere and I shall be ashamed to show my face.', 'No, we must just wait until the Copp girls come home and bind them', \"to secrecy. They'll know where the axe is and get me out. I'm not\", 'uncomfortable, as long as I keep perfectly still . . .  not uncomfortable', 'in BODY I mean. I wonder what the Copp girls value this house at. I', \"shall have to pay for the damage I've done, but I wouldn't mind that if\", 'I were only sure they would understand my motive in peeping in at their', 'pantry window. My sole comfort is that the platter is just the kind I', 'want and if Miss Copp will only sell it to me I shall be resigned to', 'what has happened.\"', '\"What if the Copp girls don\\'t come home until after night . . . or till', 'tomorrow?\" suggested Diana.', '\"If they\\'re not back by sunset you\\'ll have to go for other assistance,', 'I suppose,\" said Anne reluctantly, \"but you mustn\\'t go until you really', \"have to. Oh dear, this is a dreadful predicament. I wouldn't mind my\", \"misfortunes so much if they were romantic, as Mrs. Morgan's heroines'\", 'always are, but they are always just simply ridiculous. Fancy what the', \"Copp girls will think when they drive into their yard and see a girl's\", 'head and shoulders sticking out of the roof of one of their outhouses.', 'Listen . . . is that a wagon? No, Diana, I believe it is thunder.\"', 'Thunder it was undoubtedly, and Diana, having made a hasty pilgrimage', 'around the house, returned to announce that a very black cloud was', 'rising rapidly in the northwest.', '\"I believe we\\'re going to have a heavy thunder-shower,\" she exclaimed in', 'dismay, \"Oh, Anne, what will we do?\"', '\"We must prepare for it,\" said Anne tranquilly. A thunderstorm seemed a', 'trifle in comparison with what had already happened. \"You\\'d better drive', 'the horse and buggy into that open shed. Fortunately my parasol is in', 'the buggy. Here . . . take my hat with you. Marilla told me I was a goose', 'to put on my best hat to come to the Tory Road and she was right, as she', 'always is.\"', 'Diana untied the pony and drove into the shed, just as the first heavy', 'drops of rain fell. There she sat and watched the resulting downpour,', 'which was so thick and heavy that she could hardly see Anne through it,', 'holding the parasol bravely over her bare head. There was not a great', 'deal of thunder, but for the best part of an hour the rain came', 'merrily down. Occasionally Anne slanted back her parasol and waved an', 'encouraging hand to her friend; But conversation at that distance was', 'quite out of the question. Finally the rain ceased, the sun came out,', 'and Diana ventured across the puddles of the yard.', '\"Did you get very wet?\" she asked anxiously.', '\"Oh, no,\" returned Anne cheerfully. \"My head and shoulders are quite', 'dry and my skirt is only a little damp where the rain beat through the', \"lathes. Don't pity me, Diana, for I haven't minded it at all. I kept\", 'thinking how much good the rain will do and how glad my garden must be', 'for it, and imagining what the flowers and buds would think when the', 'drops began to fall. I imagined out a most interesting dialogue between', 'the asters and the sweet peas and the wild canaries in the lilac bush', 'and the guardian spirit of the garden. When I go home I mean to write', 'it down. I wish I had a pencil and paper to do it now, because I daresay', 'I\\'ll forget the best parts before I reach home.\"', 'Diana the faithful had a pencil and discovered a sheet of wrapping paper', 'in the box of the buggy. Anne folded up her dripping parasol, put on her', 'hat, spread the wrapping paper on a shingle Diana handed up, and wrote', 'out her garden idyl under conditions that could hardly be considered as', 'favorable to literature. Nevertheless, the result was quite pretty, and', 'Diana was \"enraptured\" when Anne read it to her.', '\"Oh, Anne, it\\'s sweet . . . just sweet. DO send it to the \\'Canadian', 'Woman.\\'\"', 'Anne shook her head.', '\"Oh, no, it wouldn\\'t be suitable at all. There is no PLOT in it, you', \"see. It's just a string of fancies. I like writing such things, but of\", 'course nothing of the sort would ever do for publication, for editors', \"insist on plots, so Priscilla says. Oh, there's Miss Sarah Copp now.\", 'PLEASE, Diana, go and explain.\"', 'Miss Sarah Copp was a small person, garbed in shabby black, with a hat', 'chosen less for vain adornment than for qualities that would wear well.', 'She looked as amazed as might be expected on seeing the curious', \"tableau in her yard, but when she heard Diana's explanation she was all\", 'sympathy. She hurriedly unlocked the back door, produced the axe, and', 'with a few skillfull blows set Anne free. The latter, somewhat tired', 'and stiff, ducked down into the interior of her prison and thankfully', 'emerged into liberty once more.', '\"Miss Copp,\" she said earnestly. \"I assure you I looked into your pantry', \"window only to discover if you had a willow-ware platter. I didn't see\", 'anything else--I didn\\'t LOOK for anything else.\"', '\"Bless you, that\\'s all right,\" said Miss Sarah amiably. \"You needn\\'t', \"worry--there's no harm done. Thank goodness, we Copps keep our pantries\", \"presentable at all times and don't care who sees into them.

Well, what', 'will you give for it?\"', '\"Twenty dollars,\" said Anne, who was never meant to match business wits', 'with a Copp, or she would not have offered her price at the start.', '\"Well, I\\'ll see,\" said Miss Sarah cautiously. \"That platter is mine', \"fortunately, or I'd never dare to sell it when Martha wasn't here. As\", \"it is, I daresay she'll raise a fuss. Martha's the boss of this\", \"establishment I can tell you. I'm getting awful tired of living under\", \"another woman's thumb. But come in, come in.

But it\\'s worth twenty-five', 'dollars. It\\'s a very old platter.\"', 'Diana gave Anne\\'s foot a gentle kick under the table, meaning, \"Don\\'t', 'agree--she\\'ll let it go for twenty if you hold out.\" But Anne was not', 'minded to take any chances in regard to that precious platter. She', 'promptly agreed to give twenty-five and Miss Sarah looked as if she felt', \"sorry she hadn't asked for thirty.\", '\"Well, I guess you may have it. I want all the money I can scare up just', 'now. The fact is--\" Miss Sarah threw up her head importantly, with a', 'proud flush on her thin cheeks--\"I\\'m going to be married--to Luther', 'Wallace.

Such a day came late in August. In the forenoon Anne and Diana', 'rowed the delighted twins down the pond to the sandshore to pick \"sweet', 'grass\" and paddle in the surf, over which the wind was harping an old', 'lyric learned when the world was young.', 'In the afternoon Anne walked down to the old Irving place to see Paul.', 'She found him stretched out on the grassy bank beside the thick fir', 'grove that sheltered the house on the north, absorbed in a book of fairy', 'tales.

It wouldn't be nice to have something wrong\", 'in your upper story, would it, teacher? I suppose the reason Mary', 'Joe imagines I have is because I tell her what I think about things', 'sometimes.\"', '\"It is a rather dangerous practice,\" admitted Anne, out of the depths of', 'her own experience.', '\"Well, by and by I\\'ll tell you the thoughts I told Mary Joe and you can', 'see for yourself if there\\'s anything queer in them,\" said Paul, \"but', \"I'll wait till it begins to get dark.

After tea Paul took Anne up to', \"his room to show her his mother's picture, which had been the mysterious\", \"birthday present kept by Mrs. Irving in the bookcase.

From out this soft glow and glamor', 'shone a sweet, girlish face, with tender mother eyes, that was hanging', 'on the wall at the foot of the bed.', '\"That\\'s my little mother,\" said Paul with loving pride. \"I got Grandma', \"to hang it there where I'd see it as soon as I opened my eyes in the\", 'morning. I never mind not having the light when I go to bed now, because', 'it just seems as if my little mother was right here with me.

I\", 'think the evening star is a lighthouse on the land where the fairies', \"dwell.' And Mary Joe said, 'Well, yous are de queer one. Dare ain't no\", \"such ting as fairies.' I was very much provoked. Of course, I knew there\", \"are no fairies; but that needn't prevent my thinking there is. You know,\", \"teacher. But I tried again quite patiently.

He must be very tall and distinguished looking,', 'with melancholy, inscrutable eyes, and a melting, sympathetic voice.', \"There was nothing either melancholy or inscrutable in Gilbert's\", \"physiognomy, but of course that didn't matter in friendship!\", 'Gilbert stretched himself out on the ferns beside the Bubble and looked', 'approvingly at Anne. If Gilbert had been asked to describe his ideal', 'woman the description would have answered point for point to Anne, even', 'to those seven tiny freckles whose obnoxious presence still continued to', 'vex her soul. Gilbert was as yet little more than a boy; but a boy has', \"his dreams as have others, and in Gilbert's future there was always a\", 'girl with big, limpid gray eyes, and a face as fine and delicate as a', 'flower. He had made up his mind, also, that his future must be worthy of', 'its goddess. Even in quiet Avonlea there were temptations to be met', 'and faced.

But he meant to keep himself worthy of Anne's\", 'friendship and perhaps some distant day her love; and he watched over', 'word and thought and deed as jealously as if her clear eyes were to', 'pass in judgment on it. She held over him the unconscious influence that', 'every girl, whose ideals are high and pure, wields over her friends; an', 'influence which would endure as long as she was faithful to those ideals', 'and which she would as certainly lose if she were ever false to them. In', \"Gilbert's eyes Anne's greatest charm was the fact that she never stooped\", 'to the petty practices of so many of the Avonlea girls--the small', 'jealousies, the little deceits and rivalries, the palpable bids for', 'favor. Anne held herself apart from all this, not consciously or of', 'design, but simply because anything of the sort was utterly foreign', 'to her transparent, impulsive nature, crystal clear in its motives and', 'aspirations.', 'But Gilbert did not attempt to put his thoughts into words, for he had', 'already too good reason to know that Anne would mercilessly and frostily', 'nip all attempts at sentiment in the bud--or laugh at him, which was ten', 'times worse.', '\"You look like a real dryad under that birch tree,\" he said teasingly.', '\"I love birch trees,\" said Anne, laying her cheek against the creamy', 'satin of the slim bole, with one of the pretty, caressing gestures that', 'came so natural to her.', '\"Then you\\'ll be glad to hear that Mr. Major Spencer has decided to set', 'out a row of white birches all along the road front of his farm, by way', 'of encouraging the A.V.I.S.,\" said Gilbert. \"He was talking to me about', 'it today.

The floor was swept,', 'the beds made, the hens fed, the muslin dress washed and hung out on the', 'line. Then Anne prepared for the transfer of feathers. She mounted to', 'the garret and donned the first old dress that came to hand . . . a navy', 'blue cashmere she had worn at fourteen. It was decidedly on the short', 'side and as \"skimpy\" as the notable wincey Anne had worn upon the', 'occasion of her debut at Green Gables; but at least it would not be', 'materially injured by down and feathers. Anne completed her toilet by', 'tying a big red and white spotted handkerchief that had belonged to', 'Matthew over her head, and, thus accoutred, betook herself to the', 'kitchen chamber, whither Marilla, before her departure, had helped her', 'carry the feather bed.', 'A cracked mirror hung by the chamber window and in an unlucky moment', 'Anne looked into it. There were those seven freckles on her nose,', 'more rampant than ever, or so it seemed in the glare of light from the', 'unshaded window.', '\"Oh, I forgot to rub that lotion on last night,\" she thought. \"I\\'d', 'better run down to the pantry and do it now.\"', 'Anne had already suffered many things trying to remove those freckles.', 'On one occasion the entire skin had peeled off her nose but the freckles', 'remained. A few days previously she had found a recipe for a freckle', 'lotion in a magazine and, as the ingredients were within her reach, she', 'straightway compounded it, much to the disgust of Marilla, who thought', 'that if Providence had placed freckles on your nose it was your bounden', 'duty to leave them there.', 'Anne scurried down to the pantry, which, always dim from the big willow', 'growing close to the window, was now almost dark by reason of the shade', 'drawn to exclude flies. Anne caught the bottle containing the lotion', 'from the shelf and copiously anointed her nose therewith by means of', 'a little sponge sacred to the purpose. This important duty done, she', 'returned to her work. Any one who has ever shifted feathers from one', 'tick to another will not need to be told that when Anne finished she', 'was a sight to behold. Her dress was white with down and fluff, and her', 'front hair, escaping from under the handkerchief, was adorned with a', 'veritable halo of feathers. At this auspicious moment a knock sounded at', 'the kitchen door.', '\"That must be Mr. Shearer,\" thought Anne. \"I\\'m in a dreadful mess but', 'I\\'ll have to run down as I am, for he\\'s always in a hurry.\"', 'Down flew Anne to the kitchen door. If ever a charitable floor did open', 'to swallow up a miserable, befeathered damsel the Green Gables porch', 'floor should promptly have engulfed Anne at that moment. On the doorstep', 'were standing Priscilla Grant, golden and fair in silk attire, a short,', 'stout gray-haired lady in a tweed suit, and another lady, tall', 'stately, wonderfully gowned, with a beautiful, highbred face and large,', 'black-lashed violet eyes, whom Anne \"instinctively felt,\" as she would', 'have said in her earlier days, to be Mrs. Charlotte E. Morgan.', 'In the dismay of the moment one thought stood out from the confusion of', \"Anne's mind and she grasped at it as at the proverbial straw. All Mrs.\", 'Morgan\\'s heroines were noted for \"rising to the occasion.\" No matter', 'what their troubles were, they invariably rose to the occasion and', 'showed their superiority over all ills of time, space, and quantity.', 'Anne therefore felt it was HER duty to rise to the occasion and she did', 'it, so perfectly that Priscilla afterward declared she never admired', 'Anne Shirley more than at that moment. No matter what her outraged', 'feelings were she did not show them. She greeted Priscilla and was', 'introduced to her companions as calmly and composedly as if she had been', 'arrayed in purple and fine linen. To be sure, it was somewhat of a shock', 'to find that the lady she had instinctively felt to be Mrs. Morgan was', 'not Mrs. Morgan at all, but an unknown Mrs. Pendexter, while the stout', 'little gray-haired woman was Mrs. Morgan; but in the greater shock the', 'lesser lost its power. Anne ushered her guests to the spare room and', 'thence into the parlor, where she left them while she hastened out to', 'help Priscilla unharness her horse.', '\"It\\'s dreadful to come upon you so unexpectedly as this,\" apologized', 'Priscilla, \"but I did not know till last night that we were coming.

It was', 'really too much.', '\"Oh, Diana, don\\'t look at me so,\" she implored. \"YOU, at least, must', \"know that the neatest person in the world couldn't empty feathers from\", 'one tick into another and remain neat in the process.\"', '\"It . . . it . . . isn\\'t the feathers,\" hesitated Diana. \"It\\'s . . .', 'it\\'s . . . your nose, Anne.\"', '\"My nose? Oh, Diana, surely nothing has gone wrong with it!\"', 'Anne rushed to the little looking glass over the sink. One glance', 'revealed the fatal truth. Her nose was a brilliant scarlet!', 'Anne sat down on the sofa, her dauntless spirit subdued at last.', '\"What is the matter with it?\" asked Diana, curiosity overcoming', 'delicacy.', '\"I thought I was rubbing my freckle lotion on it, but I must have used', 'that red dye Marilla has for marking the pattern on her rugs,\" was the', 'despairing response. \"What shall I do?\"', '\"Wash it off,\" said Diana practically.', '\"Perhaps it won\\'t wash off. First I dye my hair; then I dye my nose.', 'Marilla cut my hair off when I dyed it but that remedy would hardly be', 'practicable in this case. Well, this is another punishment for vanity', \"and I suppose I deserve it . . . though there's not much comfort in THAT.\", 'It is really almost enough to make one believe in ill-luck, though Mrs.', 'Lynde says there is no such thing, because everything is foreordained.\"', 'Fortunately the dye washed off easily and Anne, somewhat consoled,', 'betook herself to the east gable while Diana ran home. Presently Anne', 'came down again, clothed and in her right mind. The muslin dress she had', 'fondly hoped to wear was bobbing merrily about on the line outside, so', 'she was forced to content herself with her black lawn. She had the fire', 'on and the tea steeping when Diana returned; the latter wore HER muslin,', 'at least, and carried a covered platter in her hand.', '\"Mother sent you this,\" she said, lifting the cover and displaying a', \"nicely carved and jointed chicken to Anne's greatful eyes.\", 'The chicken was supplemented by light new bread, excellent butter and', \"cheese, Marilla's fruit cake and a dish of preserved plums, floating\", 'in their golden syrup as in congealed summer sunshine. There was a big', 'bowlful of pink-and-white asters also, by way of decoration; yet the', 'spread seemed very meager beside the elaborate one formerly prepared for', 'Mrs. Morgan.', \"Anne's hungry guests, however, did not seem to think anything was\", 'lacking and they ate the simple viands with apparent enjoyment. But', 'after the first few moments Anne thought no more of what was or was', \"not on her bill of fare. Mrs. Morgan's appearance might be somewhat\", 'disappointing, as even her loyal worshippers had been forced to admit to', 'each other; but she proved to be a delightful conversationalist. She had', 'traveled extensively and was an excellent storyteller. She had seen', 'much of men and women, and crystalized her experiences into witty little', 'sentences and epigrams which made her hearers feel as if they were', 'listening to one of the people in clever books. But under all her', 'sparkle there was a strongly felt undercurrent of true, womanly sympathy', 'and kindheartedness which won affection as easily as her brilliancy', 'won admiration. Nor did she monopolize the conversation. She could draw', 'others out as skillfully and fully as she could talk herself, and Anne', 'and Diana found themselves chattering freely to her. Mrs. Pendexter said', 'little; she merely smiled with her lovely eyes and lips, and ate chicken', 'and fruit cake and preserves with such exquisite grace that she conveyed', 'the impression of dining on ambrosia and honeydew. But then, as Anne', 'said to Diana later on, anybody so divinely beautiful as Mrs. Pendexter', \"didn't need to talk; it was enough for her just to LOOK.\", \"After dinner they all had a walk through Lover's Lane and Violet Vale\", \"and the Birch Path, then back through the Haunted Wood to the Dryad's\", 'Bubble, where they sat down and talked for a delightful last half hour.', 'Mrs. Morgan wanted to know how the Haunted Wood came by its name, and', \"laughed until she cried when she heard the story and Anne's dramatic\", 'account of a certain memorable walk through it at the witching hour of', 'twilight.', '\"It has indeed been a feast of reason and flow of soul, hasn\\'t it?\" said', 'Anne, when her guests had gone and she and Diana were alone again. \"I', \"don't know which I enjoyed more . . . listening to Mrs. Morgan or gazing\", \"at Mrs. Pendexter.

She had several new pupils, six- and', 'seven-year-olds just venturing, round-eyed, into a world of wonder.', 'Among them were Davy and Dora. Davy sat with Milty Boulter, who had been', 'going to school for a year and was therefore quite a man of the world.', 'Dora had made a compact at Sunday School the previous Sunday to sit', 'with Lily Sloane; but Lily Sloane not coming the first day, she was', 'temporarily assigned to Mirabel Cotton, who was ten years old and', 'therefore, in Dora\\'s eyes, one of the \"big girls.\"', '\"I think school is great fun,\" Davy told Marilla when he got home that', 'night. \"You said I\\'d find it hard to sit still and I did . . .  you mostly', 'do tell the truth, I notice . . . but you can wriggle your legs about', \"under the desk and that helps a lot.

Here is a', 'gate and a lane leading right into the wood. There must be a house at', 'the other side. Let us go down and inquire.\"', '\"What a romantic old lane this it,\" said Diana, as they walked along its', 'twists and turns. It ran under patriarchal old firs whose branches met', 'above, creating a perpetual gloom in which nothing except moss could', 'grow. On either hand were brown wood floors, crossed here and there', 'by fallen lances of sunlight.

The whole house was covered with a luxuriant growth of ivy,', 'finding easy foothold on the rough stonework and turned by autumn frosts', 'to most beautiful bronze and wine-red tints.', 'Before the house was an oblong garden into which the lane gate where', 'the girls were standing opened. The house bounded it on one side; on', 'the three others it was enclosed by an old stone dyke, so overgrown with', 'moss and grass and ferns that it looked like a high, green bank. On the', 'right and left the tall, dark spruces spread their palm-like branches', 'over it; but below it was a little meadow, green with clover aftermath,', 'sloping down to the blue loop of the Grafton River. No other house or', 'clearing was in sight . . . nothing but hills and valleys covered with', 'feathery young firs.', '\"I wonder what sort of a person Miss Lewis is,\" speculated Diana as they', 'opened the gate into the garden. \"They say she is very peculiar.\"', '\"She\\'ll be interesting then,\" said Anne decidedly. \"Peculiar people are', \"always that at least, whatever else they are or are not.

Perhaps some fatal\", \"mischance has befallen him . . . though THAT'S against the law of all\", 'fairy tales.\"', '\"I\\'m afraid he came long ago and went away again,\" said Diana. \"They say', \"she used to be engaged to Stephan Irving . . . Paul's father . . . when\", 'they were young. But they quarreled and parted.\"', '\"Hush,\" warned Anne. \"The door is open.\"', 'The girls paused in the porch under the tendrils of ivy and knocked', 'at the open door. There was a patter of steps inside and a rather odd', 'little personage presented herself . . . a girl of about fourteen, with a', 'freckled face, a snub nose, a mouth so wide that it did really seem as', 'if it stretched \"from ear to ear,\" and two long braids of fair hair tied', 'with two enormous bows of blue ribbon.', '\"Is Miss Lewis at home?\" asked Diana.', '\"Yes, ma\\'am. Come in, ma\\'am. I\\'ll tell Miss Lavendar you\\'re here, ma\\'am.', 'She\\'s upstairs, ma\\'am.\"', 'With this the small handmaiden whisked out of sight and the girls,', 'left alone, looked about them with delighted eyes. The interior of this', 'wonderful little house was quite as interesting as its exterior.', 'The room had a low ceiling and two square, small-paned windows,', 'curtained with muslin frills. All the furnishings were old-fashioned,', 'but so well and daintily kept that the effect was delicious. But it must', 'be candidly admitted that the most attractive feature, to two healthy', 'girls who had just tramped four miles through autumn air, was a table,', 'set out with pale blue china and laden with delicacies, while little', 'golden-hued ferns scattered over the cloth gave it what Anne would have', 'termed \"a festal air.\"', '\"Miss Lavendar must be expecting company to tea,\" she whispered. \"There', 'are six places set.

Her name isn't really Charlotta at all.\", \"It is . . . let me see . . . what is it? I THINK it's Leonora . . . yes, it\", 'IS Leonora. You see, it is this way. When mother died ten years ago I', \"couldn't stay here alone . . .  and I couldn't afford to pay the wages of\", 'a grown-up girl. So I got little Charlotta Bowman to come and stay with', 'me for board and clothes. Her name really was Charlotta . . . she was', 'Charlotta the First. She was just thirteen.

Nevertheless, Anne keenly', 'enjoyed her walk through the great gray maze of the beechlands; though', 'alone she never found it lonely; her imagination peopled her path', 'with merry companions, and with these she carried on a gay, pretended', 'conversation that was wittier and more fascinating than conversations', 'are apt to be in real life, where people sometimes fail most lamentably', 'to talk up to the requirements.

But it was her way of amusing herself and I', \"could have reconciled myself to it if she'd left me alone. But that\", \"she wouldn't do.

I didn't try to improve as I might have done . . . I just got cranky\", \"and disagreeable when she found fault. I told her one day she hadn't\", \"complained of my grammar when I proposed to her.

Well, we bickered', \"along like that and it wasn't exactly pleasant, but we might have got\", \"used to each other after a spell if it hadn't been for Ginger. Ginger\", \"was the rock we split on at last. Emily didn't like parrots and she\", \"couldn't stand Ginger's profane habits of speech. I was attached to the\", \"bird for my brother the sailor's sake. My brother the sailor was a pet\", \"of mine when we were little tads and he'd sent Ginger to me when he was\", \"dying.

oak, by storms uprooted,', 'Lay the great trunk of an oak-tree,', 'Buried half in leaves and mosses,', 'Mouldering, crumbling, huge and hollow.', 'And Osseo, when he saw it,', 'Gave a shout, a cry of anguish,', 'Leaped into its yawning cavern,', 'At one end went in an old man,', 'Wasted, wrinkled, old, and ugly;', 'From the other came a young man,', 'Tall and straight and strong and handsome.',

silver,', 'And the roof of bark upon them', 'As the shining shards of beetles.', '\"Then Osseo gazed around him,', 'And he saw the nine fair sisters,', 'All the sisters and their husbands,', 'Changed to birds of various plumage.', 'Some were jays and some were magpies,', 'Others thrushes, others blackbirds;', 'And they hopped, and sang, and twittered,', 'Perked and fluttered all their feathers,',
