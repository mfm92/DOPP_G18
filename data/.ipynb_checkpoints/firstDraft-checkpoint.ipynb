A. Harrison's house\", 'like a great white mountain, was far away in a delicious world where a', 'certain schoolteacher was doing a wonderful work, shaping the destinies', 'of future statesmen, and inspiring youthful minds and hearts with high', 'and lofty ambitions.', 'To be sure, if you came down to harsh facts . . . which, it must be', 'confessed, Anne seldom did until she had to . . . it did not seem likely', 'that there was much promising material for celebrities in Avonlea', 'school; but you could never tell what might happen if a teacher used', 'her influence for good. Anne had certain rose-tinted ideals of what a', 'teacher might accomplish if she only went the right way about it; and', 'she was in the midst of a delightful scene, forty years hence, with a', 'famous personage . . . just exactly what he was to be famous for was left', 'in convenient haziness, but Anne thought it would be rather nice to have', 'him a college president or a Canadian premier . . . bowing low over her', 'wrinkled hand and assuring her that it was she who had first kindled his', 'ambition, and that all his success in life was due to the lessons she', 'had instilled so long ago in Avonlea school. This pleasant vision was', 'shattered by a most unpleasant interruption.', 'A demure little Jersey cow came scuttling down the lane and five seconds', 'later Mr. Harrison arrived . . . if \"arrived\" be not too mild a term to', 'describe the manner of his irruption into the yard.', 'He bounced over the fence without waiting to open the gate, and angrily', 'confronted astonished Anne, who had risen to her feet and stood looking', 'at him in some bewilderment. Mr. Harrison was their new righthand', 'neighbor and she had never met him before, although she had seen him', 'once or twice.', \"In early April, before Anne had come home from Queen's, Mr. Robert Bell,\", 'whose farm adjoined the Cuthbert place on the west, had sold out and', 'moved to Charlottetown. His farm had been bought by a certain Mr. J. A.', 'Harrison, whose name, and the fact that he was a New Brunswick man, were', 'all that was known about him. But before he had been a month in Avonlea', 'he had won the reputation of being an odd person . . . \"a crank,\" Mrs.', 'Rachel Lynde said. Mrs. Rachel was an outspoken lady, as those of you', 'who may have already made her acquaintance will remember. Mr. Harrison', 'was certainly different from other people . . . and that is the essential', 'characteristic of a crank, as everybody knows.', 'In the first place he kept house for himself and had publicly stated', 'that he wanted no fools of women around his diggings. Feminine', 'Avonlea took its revenge by the gruesome tales it related about his', 'house-keeping and cooking. He had hired little John Henry Carter of', 'White Sands and John Henry started the stories. For one thing, there', 'was never any stated time for meals in the Harrison establishment. Mr.', 'Harrison \"got a bite\" when he felt hungry, and if John Henry were around', 'at the time, he came in for a share, but if he were not, he had to wait', \"until Mr. Harrison's next hungry spell. John Henry mournfully averred\", \"that he would have starved to death if it wasn't that he got home on\", 'Sundays and got a good filling up, and that his mother always gave him a', 'basket of \"grub\" to take back with him on Monday mornings.', 'As for washing dishes, Mr. Harrison never made any pretence of doing it', 'unless a rainy Sunday came. Then he went to work and washed them all at', 'once in the rainwater hogshead, and left them to drain dry.', 'Again, Mr. Harrison was \"close.\" When he was asked to subscribe to the', \"Rev. Mr. Allan's salary he said he'd wait and see how many dollars'\", \"worth of good he got out of his preaching first . . . he didn't believe\", 'in buying a pig in a poke. And when Mrs. Lynde went to ask for a', 'contribution to missions . . . and incidentally to see the inside of', 'the house . . . he told her there were more heathens among the old woman', \"gossips in Avonlea than anywhere else he knew of, and he'd cheerfully\", \"contribute to a mission for Christianizing them if she'd undertake it.\", 'Mrs. Rachel got herself away and said it was a mercy poor Mrs. Robert', 'Bell was safe in her grave, for it would have broken her heart to see', 'the state of her house in which she used to take so much pride.', '\"Why, she scrubbed the kitchen floor every second day,\" Mrs. Lynde told', 'Marilla Cuthbert indignantly, \"and if you could see it now! I had to', 'hold up my skirts as I walked across it.\"', 'Finally, Mr. Harrison kept a parrot called Ginger. Nobody in Avonlea had', 'ever kept a parrot before; consequently that proceeding was considered', \"barely respectable. And such a parrot! If you took John Henry Carter's\", 'word for it, never was such an unholy bird. It swore terribly. Mrs.', 'Carter would have taken John Henry away at once if she had been sure', 'she could get another place for him. Besides, Ginger had bitten a piece', \"right out of the back of John Henry's neck one day when he had stooped\", 'down too near the cage. Mrs. Carter showed everybody the mark when the', 'luckless John Henry went home on Sundays.', \"All these things flashed through Anne's mind as Mr. Harrison stood,\", 'quite speechless with wrath apparently, before her. In his most amiable', 'mood Mr. Harrison could not have been considered a handsome man; he was', 'short and fat and bald; and now, with his round face purple with rage', 'and his prominent blue eyes almost sticking out of his head, Anne', 'thought he was really the ugliest person she had ever seen.', 'All at once Mr. Harrison found his voice.', '\"I\\'m not going to put up with this,\" he spluttered, \"not a day longer,', 'do you hear, miss. Bless my soul, this is the third time, miss . . .  the', 'third time! Patience has ceased to be a virtue, miss. I warned your aunt', \"the last time not to let it occur again . . .  and she's let it . . . she's\", 'done it . . . what does she mean by it, that is what I want to know. That', 'is what I\\'m here about, miss.\"', '\"Will you explain what the trouble is?\" asked Anne, in her most', 'dignified manner. She had been practicing it considerably of late to', 'have it in good working order when school began; but it had no apparent', 'effect on the irate J. A. Harrison.', '\"Trouble, is it? Bless my soul, trouble enough, I should think. The', \"trouble is, miss, that I found that Jersey cow of your aunt's in my oats\", 'again, not half an hour ago. The third time, mark you. I found her in', 'last Tuesday and I found her in yesterday. I came here and told your', \"aunt not to let it occur again. She has let it occur again. Where's your\", 'aunt, miss? I just want to see her for a minute and give her a piece of', 'my mind . . . a piece of J. A. Harrison\\'s mind, miss.\"', '\"If you mean Miss Marilla Cuthbert, she is not my aunt, and she has gone', 'down to East Grafton to see a distant relative of hers who is very ill,\"', 'said Anne, with due increase of dignity at every word. \"I am very sorry', 'that my cow should have broken into your oats . . .  she is my cow and not', \"Miss Cuthbert's . . . Matthew gave her to me three years ago when she was\", 'a little calf and he bought her from Mr. Bell.\"', '\"Sorry, miss! Sorry isn\\'t going to help matters any. You\\'d better go and', 'look at the havoc that animal has made in my oats . . . trampled them from', 'center to circumference, miss.\"', '\"I am very sorry,\" repeated Anne firmly, \"but perhaps if you kept your', 'fences in better repair Dolly might not have broken in. It is your part', 'of the line fence that separates your oatfield from our pasture and I', 'noticed the other day that it was not in very good condition.\"', '\"My fence is all right,\" snapped Mr. Harrison, angrier than ever at this', 'carrying of the war into the enemy\\'s country. \"The jail fence couldn\\'t', 'keep a demon of a cow like that out. And I can tell you, you redheaded', \"snippet, that if the cow is yours, as you say, you'd be better employed\", \"in watching her out of other people's grain than in sitting round\", 'reading yellow-covered novels,\" . . . with a scathing glance at the', \"innocent tan-colored Virgil by Anne's feet.\", \"Something at that moment was red besides Anne's hair . . . which had\", 'always been a tender point with her.', '\"I\\'d rather have red hair than none at all, except a little fringe round', 'my ears,\" she flashed.', 'The shot told, for Mr. Harrison was really very sensitive about his bald', 'head. His anger choked him up again and he could only glare speechlessly', 'at Anne, who recovered her temper and followed up her advantage.', '\"I can make allowance for you, Mr. Harrison, because I have an', 'imagination. I can easily imagine how very trying it must be to find a', 'cow in your oats and I shall not cherish any hard feelings against you', \"for the things you've said. I promise you that Dolly shall never break\", 'into your oats again. I give you my word of honor on THAT point.\"', '\"Well, mind you she doesn\\'t,\" muttered Mr. Harrison in a somewhat', 'subdued tone; but he stamped off angrily enough and Anne heard him', 'growling to himself until he was out of earshot.', 'Grievously disturbed in mind, Anne marched across the yard and shut the', 'naughty Jersey up in the milking pen.', '\"She can\\'t possibly get out of that unless she tears the fence down,\"', 'she reflected. \"She looks pretty quiet now. I daresay she has sickened', \"herself on those oats. I wish I'd sold her to Mr. Shearer when he wanted\", 'her last week, but I thought it was just as well to wait until we had', 'the auction of the stock and let them all go together. I believe it is', \"true about Mr. Harrison being a crank. Certainly there's nothing of the\", 'kindred spirit about HIM.\"', 'Anne had always a weather eye open for kindred spirits.', 'Marilla Cuthbert was driving into the yard as Anne returned from the', 'house, and the latter flew to get tea ready. They discussed the matter', 'at the tea table.', '\"I\\'ll be glad when the auction is over,\" said Marilla. \"It is too much', 'responsibility having so much stock about the place and nobody but that', 'unreliable Martin to look after them. He has never come back yet and he', \"promised that he would certainly be back last night if I'd give him the\", \"day off to go to his aunt's funeral. I don't know how many aunts he has\", \"got, I am sure. That's the fourth that's died since he hired here a year\", \"ago. I'll be more than thankful when the crop is in and Mr. Barry takes\", \"over the farm. We'll have to keep Dolly shut up in the pen till Martin\", 'comes, for she must be put in the back pasture and the fences there have', \"to be fixed. I declare, it is a world of trouble, as Rachel says. Here's\", 'poor Mary Keith dying and what is to become of those two children of', 'hers is more than I know. She has a brother in British Columbia and she', 'has written to him about them, but she hasn\\'t heard from him yet.\"', '\"What are the children like? How old are they?\"', '\"Six past . . . they\\'re twins.\"', '\"Oh, I\\'ve always been especially interested in twins ever since Mrs.', 'Hammond had so many,\" said Anne eagerly. \"Are they pretty?\"', '\"Goodness, you couldn\\'t tell . . . they were too dirty. Davy had been', 'out making mud pies and Dora went out to call him in. Davy pushed her', 'headfirst into the biggest pie and then, because she cried, he got into', 'it himself and wallowed in it to show her it was nothing to cry about.', 'Mary said Dora was really a very good child but that Davy was full of', 'mischief. He has never had any bringing up you might say. His father', 'died when he was a baby and Mary has been sick almost ever since.\"', '\"I\\'m always sorry for children that have no bringing up,\" said Anne', 'soberly. \"You know _I_ hadn\\'t any till you took me in hand. I hope their', 'uncle will look after them. Just what relation is Mrs. Keith to you?\"', '\"Mary? None in the world. It was her husband . . . he was our third', \"cousin. There's Mrs. Lynde coming through the yard. I thought she'd be\", 'up to hear about Mary.\"', '\"Don\\'t tell her about Mr. Harrison and the cow,\" implored Anne.', 'Marilla promised; but the promise was quite unnecessary, for Mrs. Lynde', 'was no sooner fairly seated than she said,', '\"I saw Mr. Harrison chasing your Jersey out of his oats today when I was', 'coming home from Carmody. I thought he looked pretty mad. Did he make', 'much of a rumpus?\"', 'Anne and Marilla furtively exchanged amused smiles. Few things in', 'Avonlea ever escaped Mrs. Lynde. It was only that morning Anne had said,', '\"If you went to your own room at midnight, locked the door, pulled down', 'the blind, and SNEEZED, Mrs. Lynde would ask you the next day how your', 'cold was!\"', '\"I believe he did,\" admitted Marilla. \"I was away. He gave Anne a piece', 'of his mind.\"', '\"I think he is a very disagreeable man,\" said Anne, with a resentful', 'toss of her ruddy head.', '\"You never said a truer word,\" said Mrs. Rachel solemnly. \"I knew', \"there'd be trouble when Robert Bell sold his place to a New Brunswick\", \"man, that's what. I don't know what Avonlea is coming to, with so many\", \"strange people rushing into it. It'll soon not be safe to go to sleep in\", 'our beds.\"', '\"Why, what other strangers are coming in?\" asked Marilla.', '\"Haven\\'t you heard? Well, there\\'s a family of Donnells, for one thing.', \"They've rented Peter Sloane's old house. Peter has hired the man to run\", 'his mill. They belong down east and nobody knows anything about them.', 'Then that shiftless Timothy Cotton family are going to move up from', \"White Sands and they'll simply be a burden on the public. He is\", \"in consumption . . . when he isn't stealing . . .  and his wife is a\", \"slack-twisted creature that can't turn her hand to a thing. She washes\", \"her dishes SITTING DOWN. Mrs. George Pye has taken her husband's orphan\", \"nephew, Anthony Pye. He'll be going to school to you, Anne, so you may\", \"expect trouble, that's what. And you'll have another strange pupil, too.\", 'Paul Irving is coming from the States to live with his grandmother.', 'You remember his father, Marilla . . . Stephen Irving, him that jilted', 'Lavendar Lewis over at Grafton?\"', '\"I don\\'t think he jilted her. There was a quarrel . . . I suppose there', 'was blame on both sides.\"', '\"Well, anyway, he didn\\'t marry her, and she\\'s been as queer as possible', 'ever since, they say . . . living all by herself in that little stone', 'house she calls Echo Lodge. Stephen went off to the States and went', \"into business with his uncle and married a Yankee. He's never been home\", 'since, though his mother has been up to see him once or twice. His wife', \"died two years ago and he's sending the boy home to his mother for a\", \"spell. He's ten years old and I don't know if he'll be a very desirable\", 'pupil. You can never tell about those Yankees.\"', 'Mrs Lynde looked upon all people who had the misfortune to be born', 'or brought up elsewhere than in Prince Edward Island with a decided', 'can-any-good-thing-come-out-of-Nazareth air. They MIGHT be good people,', 'of course; but you were on the safe side in doubting it. She had a', 'special prejudice against \"Yankees.\" Her husband had been cheated out', 'of ten dollars by an employer for whom he had once worked in Boston and', 'neither angels nor principalities nor powers could have convinced Mrs.', 'Rachel that the whole United States was not responsible for it.', '\"Avonlea school won\\'t be the worse for a little new blood,\" said Marilla', 'drily, \"and if this boy is anything like his father he\\'ll be all right.', 'Steve Irving was the nicest boy that was ever raised in these parts,', 'though some people did call him proud. I should think Mrs. Irving would', 'be very glad to have the child. She has been very lonesome since her', 'husband died.\"', '\"Oh, the boy may be well enough, but he\\'ll be different from Avonlea', 'children,\" said Mrs. Rachel, as if that clinched the matter. Mrs.', \"Rachel's opinions concerning any person, place, or thing, were always\", 'warranted to wear. \"What\\'s this I hear about your going to start up a', 'Village Improvement Society, Anne?\"', '\"I was just talking it over with some of the girls and boys at the last', 'Debating Club,\" said Anne, flushing. \"They thought it would be rather', 'nice . . . and so do Mr. and Mrs. Allan. Lots of villages have them now.\"', '\"Well, you\\'ll get into no end of hot water if you do. Better leave it', 'alone, Anne, that\\'s what. People don\\'t like being improved.\"', '\"Oh, we are not going to try to improve the PEOPLE. It is Avonlea', 'itself. There are lots of things which might be done to make it', 'prettier. For instance, if we could coax Mr. Levi Boulter to pull', \"down that dreadful old house on his upper farm wouldn't that be an\", 'improvement?\"', '\"It certainly would,\" admitted Mrs. Rachel. \"That old ruin has been an', 'eyesore to the settlement for years. But if you Improvers can coax', \"Levi Boulter to do anything for the public that he isn't to be paid for\", \"doing, may I be there to see and hear the process, that's what. I don't\", 'want to discourage you, Anne, for there may be something in your idea,', 'though I suppose you did get it out of some rubbishy Yankee magazine;', \"but you'll have your hands full with your school and I advise you as a\", \"friend not to bother with your improvements, that's what. But there,\", \"I know you'll go ahead with it if you've set your mind on it. You were\", 'always one to carry a thing through somehow.\"', \"Something about the firm outlines of Anne's lips told that Mrs. Rachel\", \"was not far astray in this estimate. Anne's heart was bent on forming\", 'the Improvement Society. Gilbert Blythe, who was to teach in White', 'Sands but would always be home from Friday night to Monday morning, was', 'enthusiastic about it; and most of the other folks were willing to go in', 'for anything that meant occasional meetings and consequently some \"fun.\"', 'As for what the \"improvements\" were to be, nobody had any very clear', 'idea except Anne and Gilbert. They had talked them over and planned them', 'out until an ideal Avonlea existed in their minds, if nowhere else.', 'Mrs. Rachel had still another item of news.', '\"They\\'ve given the Carmody school to a Priscilla Grant. Didn\\'t you go to', 'Queen\\'s with a girl of that name, Anne?\"', '\"Yes, indeed. Priscilla to teach at Carmody! How perfectly lovely!\"', 'exclaimed Anne, her gray eyes lighting up until they looked like evening', 'stars, causing Mrs. Lynde to wonder anew if she would ever get it', 'settled to her satisfaction whether Anne Shirley were really a pretty', 'girl or not.', 'II', 'Selling in Haste and Repenting at Leisure', 'Anne drove over to Carmody on a shopping expedition the next afternoon', 'and took Diana Barry with her. Diana was, of course, a pledged member of', 'the Improvement Society, and the two girls talked about little else all', 'the way to Carmody and back.', '\"The very first thing we ought to do when we get started is to have that', 'hall painted,\" said Diana, as they drove past the Avonlea hall, a rather', 'shabby building set down in a wooded hollow, with spruce trees hooding', 'it about on all sides. \"It\\'s a disgraceful looking place and we must', 'attend to it even before we try to get Mr. Levi Boulder to pull his', \"house down. Father says we'll never succeed in DOING that. Levi Boulter\", 'is too mean to spend the time it would take.\"', '\"Perhaps he\\'ll let the boys take it down if they promise to haul', 'the boards and split them up for him for kindling wood,\" said Anne', 'hopefully. \"We must do our best and be content to go slowly at first.', \"We can't expect to improve everything all at once. We'll have to educate\", 'public sentiment first, of course.\"', \"Diana wasn't exactly sure what educating public sentiment meant; but it\", 'sounded fine and she felt rather proud that she was going to belong to a', 'society with such an aim in view.', '\"I thought of something last night that we could do, Anne. You know', 'that three-cornered piece of ground where the roads from Carmody and', \"Newbridge and White Sands meet? It's all grown over with young spruce;\", \"but wouldn't it be nice to have them all cleared out, and just leave the\", 'two or three birch trees that are on it?\"', '\"Splendid,\" agreed Anne gaily. \"And have a rustic seat put under the', \"birches. And when spring comes we'll have a flower-bed made in the\", 'middle of it and plant geraniums.\"', '\"Yes; only we\\'ll have to devise some way of getting old Mrs. Hiram', \"Sloane to keep her cow off the road, or she'll eat our geraniums\", 'up,\" laughed Diana. \"I begin to see what you mean by educating public', \"sentiment, Anne. There's the old Boulter house now. Did you ever see\", 'such a rookery? And perched right close to the road too. An old house', 'with its windows gone always makes me think of something dead with its', 'eyes picked out.\"', '\"I think an old, deserted house is such a sad sight,\" said Anne', 'dreamily. \"It always seems to me to be thinking about its past and', 'mourning for its old-time joys. Marilla says that a large family was', 'raised in that old house long ago, and that it was a real pretty place,', 'with a lovely garden and roses climbing all over it. It was full of', 'little children and laughter and songs; and now it is empty, and nothing', 'ever wanders through it but the wind. How lonely and sorrowful it must', 'feel! Perhaps they all come back on moonlit nights . . . the ghosts of the', 'little children of long ago and the roses and the songs . . . and for a', 'little while the old house can dream it is young and joyous again.\"', 'Diana shook her head.', '\"I never imagine things like that about places now, Anne. Don\\'t you', 'remember how cross mother and Marilla were when we imagined ghosts into', \"the Haunted Wood? To this day I can't go through that bush comfortably\", 'after dark; and if I began imagining such things about the old Boulter', \"house I'd be frightened to pass it too. Besides, those children aren't\", \"dead. They're all grown up and doing well . . . and one of them is a\", 'butcher. And flowers and songs couldn\\'t have ghosts anyhow.\"', 'Anne smothered a little sigh. She loved Diana dearly and they had always', 'been good comrades. But she had long ago learned that when she wandered', 'into the realm of fancy she must go alone. The way to it was by an', 'enchanted path where not even her dearest might follow her.', 'A thunder-shower came up while the girls were at Carmody; it did', 'not last long, however, and the drive home, through lanes where the', 'raindrops sparkled on the boughs and little leafy valleys where the', 'drenched ferns gave out spicy odors, was delightful. But just as they', 'turned into the Cuthbert lane Anne saw something that spoiled the beauty', 'of the landscape for her.', \"Before them on the right extended Mr. Harrison's broad, gray-green field\", 'of late oats, wet and luxuriant; and there, standing squarely in the', 'middle of it, up to her sleek sides in the lush growth, and blinking at', 'them calmly over the intervening tassels, was a Jersey cow!', 'Anne dropped the reins and stood up with a tightening of the lips that', 'boded no good to the predatory quadruped. Not a word said she, but she', 'climbed nimbly down over the wheels, and whisked across the fence before', 'Diana understood what had happened.', '\"Anne, come back,\" shrieked the latter, as soon as she found her voice.', '\"You\\'ll ruin your dress in that wet grain . . . ruin it. She doesn\\'t hear', \"me! Well, she'll never get that cow out by herself. I must go and help\", 'her, of course.\"', 'Anne was charging through the grain like a mad thing. Diana hopped', 'briskly down, tied the horse securely to a post, turned the skirt of her', 'pretty gingham dress over her shoulders, mounted the fence, and started', 'in pursuit of her frantic friend. She could run faster than Anne, who', 'was hampered by her clinging and drenched skirt, and soon overtook her.', \"Behind them they left a trail that would break Mr. Harrison's heart when\", 'he should see it.', '\"Anne, for mercy\\'s sake, stop,\" panted poor Diana. \"I\\'m right out of', 'breath and you are wet to the skin.\"', '\"I must . . . get . . . that cow . . . out . . . before . . . Mr.', 'Harrison . . . sees her,\" gasped Anne. \"I don\\'t . . . care . . . if I\\'m', '. . . drowned . . . if we . . . can . . . only . . . do that.\"', 'But the Jersey cow appeared to see no good reason for being hustled out', 'of her luscious browsing ground. No sooner had the two breathless girls', 'got near her than she turned and bolted squarely for the opposite corner', 'of the field.', '\"Head her off,\" screamed Anne. \"Run, Diana, run.\"', 'Diana did run. Anne tried to, and the wicked Jersey went around the', 'field as if she were possessed. Privately, Diana thought she was. It was', 'fully ten minutes before they headed her off and drove her through the', 'corner gap into the Cuthbert lane.', 'There is no denying that Anne was in anything but an angelic temper', 'at that precise moment. Nor did it soothe her in the least to behold a', 'buggy halted just outside the lane, wherein sat Mr. Shearer of Carmody', 'and his son, both of whom wore a broad smile.', '\"I guess you\\'d better have sold me that cow when I wanted to buy her', 'last week, Anne,\" chuckled Mr. Shearer.', '\"I\\'ll sell her to you now, if you want her,\" said her flushed and', 'disheveled owner. \"You may have her this very minute.\"', '\"Done. I\\'ll give you twenty for her as I offered before, and Jim here', \"can drive her right over to Carmody. She'll go to town with the rest of\", 'the shipment this evening. Mr. Reed of Brighton wants a Jersey cow.\"', 'Five minutes later Jim Shearer and the Jersey cow were marching up the', 'road, and impulsive Anne was driving along the Green Gables lane with', 'her twenty dollars.', '\"What will Marilla say?\" asked Diana.', '\"Oh, she won\\'t care. Dolly was my own cow and it isn\\'t likely she\\'d', 'bring more than twenty dollars at the auction. But oh dear, if Mr.', 'Harrison sees that grain he will know she has been in again, and after', \"my giving him my word of honor that I'd never let it happen! Well, it\", 'has taught me a lesson not to give my word of honor about cows. A cow', \"that could jump over or break through our milk-pen fence couldn't be\", 'trusted anywhere.\"', \"Marilla had gone down to Mrs. Lynde's, and when she returned knew all\", \"about Dolly's sale and transfer, for Mrs. Lynde had seen most of the\", 'transaction from her window and guessed the rest.', '\"I suppose it\\'s just as well she\\'s gone, though you DO do things in a', \"dreadful headlong fashion, Anne. I don't see how she got out of the pen,\", 'though. She must have broken some of the boards off.\"', '\"I didn\\'t think of looking,\" said Anne, \"but I\\'ll go and see now.

A tall, awkward girl in a back seat, who\", 'seemed to have too many feet and hands, Anne could not place at all, but', 'later on discovered that her name was Barbara Shaw and that she had come', 'to live with an Avonlea aunt. She was also to find that if Barbara ever', 'managed to walk down the aisle without falling over her own or somebody', \"else's feet the Avonlea scholars wrote the unusual fact up on the porch\", 'wall to commemorate it.', \"But when Anne's eyes met those of the boy at the front desk facing\", 'her own, a queer little thrill went over her, as if she had found her', 'genius. She knew this must be Paul Irving and that Mrs. Rachel Lynde', 'had been right for once when she prophesied that he would be unlike the', 'Avonlea children. More than that, Anne realized that he was unlike other', 'children anywhere, and that there was a soul subtly akin to her own', 'gazing at her out of the very dark blue eyes that were watching her so', 'intently.', 'She knew Paul was ten but he looked no more than eight. He had the most', 'beautiful little face she had ever seen in a child . . .  features of', 'exquisite delicacy and refinement, framed in a halo of chestnut curls.', 'His mouth was delicious, being full without pouting, the crimson lips', 'just softly touching and curving into finely finished little corners', 'that narrowly escaped being dimpled. He had a sober, grave, meditative', 'expression, as if his spirit was much older than his body; but when', 'Anne smiled softly at him it vanished in a sudden answering smile, which', 'seemed an illumination of his whole being, as if some lamp had suddenly', 'kindled into flame inside of him, irradiating him from top to toe. Best', 'of all, it was involuntary, born of no external effort or motive, but', 'simply the outflashing of a hidden personality, rare and fine and sweet.', 'With a quick interchange of smiles Anne and Paul were fast friends', 'forever before a word had passed between them.', 'The day went by like a dream. Anne could never clearly recall it', 'afterwards. It almost seemed as if it were not she who was teaching', 'but somebody else. She heard classes and worked sums and set copies', 'mechanically. The children behaved quite well; only two cases of', 'discipline occurred. Morley Andrews was caught driving a pair of trained', 'crickets in the aisle. Anne stood Morley on the platform for an', 'hour and . . . which Morley felt much more keenly . . .  confiscated his', 'crickets. She put them in a box and on the way from school set them free', 'in Violet Vale; but Morley believed, then and ever afterwards, that she', 'took them home and kept them for her own amusement.', 'The other culprit was Anthony Pye, who poured the last drops of water', \"from his slate bottle down the back of Aurelia Clay's neck. Anne kept\", 'Anthony in at recess and talked to him about what was expected of', \"gentlemen, admonishing him that they never poured water down ladies'\", 'necks. She wanted all her boys to be gentlemen, she said. Her little', 'lecture was quite kind and touching; but unfortunately Anthony remained', 'absolutely untouched. He listened to her in silence, with the same', 'sullen expression, and whistled scornfully as he went out. Anne', \"sighed; and then cheered herself up by remembering that winning a Pye's\", \"affections, like the building of Rome, wasn't the work of a day. In\", 'fact, it was doubtful whether some of the Pyes had any affections to', 'win; but Anne hoped better things of Anthony, who looked as if he might', 'be a rather nice boy if one ever got behind his sullenness.', 'When school was dismissed and the children had gone Anne dropped wearily', 'into her chair. Her head ached and she felt woefully discouraged. There', 'was no real reason for discouragement, since nothing very dreadful had', 'occurred; but Anne was very tired and inclined to believe that she would', 'never learn to like teaching. And how terrible it would be to be doing', \"something you didn't like every day for . . . well, say forty years. Anne\", 'was of two minds whether to have her cry out then and there, or wait', 'till she was safely in her own white room at home. Before she could', 'decide there was a click of heels and a silken swish on the porch floor,', 'and Anne found herself confronted by a lady whose appearance made her', \"recall a recent criticism of Mr. Harrison's on an overdressed female he\", 'had seen in a Charlottetown store. \"She looked like a head-on collision', 'between a fashion plate and a nightmare.\"', 'The newcomer was gorgeously arrayed in a pale blue summer silk, puffed,', 'frilled, and shirred wherever puff, frill, or shirring could possibly', 'be placed. Her head was surmounted by a huge white chiffon hat, bedecked', 'with three long but rather stringy ostrich feathers. A veil of pink', 'chiffon, lavishly sprinkled with huge black dots, hung like a flounce', 'from the hat brim to her shoulders and floated off in two airy streamers', 'behind her. She wore all the jewelry that could be crowded on one small', 'woman, and a very strong odor of perfume attended her.', '\"I am Mrs. DonNELL . . . Mrs. H. B.

Then the lane', 'turned at right angles and plunged into a spruce wood so thick and dark', 'that they walked in a gloom as of twilight, with not a glimpse of sky or', 'sunlight to be seen.', '\"This is where the bad wood elves dwell,\" whispered Anne. \"They are', \"impish and malicious but they can't harm us, because they are not\", 'allowed to do evil in the spring.

Anne only gazed in', 'eloquent silence.', '\"How in the world does it happen that there ever was a garden back', 'here?\" said Priscilla in amazement.', '\"It must be Hester Gray\\'s garden,\" said Diana. \"I\\'ve heard mother speak', \"of it but I never saw it before, and I wouldn't have supposed that it\", 'could be in existence still.

Why, girls, there', \"are hundreds of them . . . they've spread over everything. It looks as if\", 'the garden were carpeted with moonshine and sunshine combined. This is', \"a discovery worth making. To think that I've lived within a mile of this\", 'place for six years and have never seen it before! Now, Diana.\"', '\"Long ago,\" began Diana, \"this farm belonged to old Mr. David Gray. He', \"didn't live on it . . . he lived where Silas Sloane lives now. He had one\", 'son, Jordan, and he went up to Boston one winter to work and while', 'he was there he fell in love with a girl named Hester Murray. She', \"was working in a store and she hated it. She'd been brought up in the\", 'country and she always wanted to get back. When Jordan asked her to', \"marry him she said she would if he'd take her away to some quiet spot\", \"where she'd see nothing but fields and trees. So he brought her to\", 'Avonlea. Mrs. Lynde said he was taking a fearful risk in marrying a', \"Yankee, and it's certain that Hester was very delicate and a very poor\", 'housekeeper; but mother says she was very pretty and sweet and Jordan', 'just worshipped the ground she walked on. Well, Mr. Gray gave Jordan', 'this farm and he built a little house back here and Jordan and Hester', 'lived in it for four years. She never went out much and hardly anybody', 'went to see her except mother and Mrs. Lynde. Jordan made her this', 'garden and she was crazy about it and spent most of her time in it. She', \"wasn't much of a housekeeper but she had a knack with flowers. And then\", 'she got sick. Mother says she thinks she was in consumption before she', 'ever came here. She never really laid up but just grew weaker and weaker', \"all the time. Jordan wouldn't have anybody to wait on her. He did it all\", 'himself and mother says he was as tender and gentle as a woman. Every', \"day he'd wrap her in a shawl and carry her out to the garden and she'd\", 'lie there on a bench quite happy. They say she used to make Jordan kneel', 'down by her every night and morning and pray with her that she might die', 'out in the garden when the time came. And her prayer was answered. One', 'day Jordan carried her out to the bench and then he picked all the roses', 'that were out and heaped them over her; and she just smiled up at him', '. . . and closed her eyes . . . and that,\" concluded Diana softly, \"was', 'the end.\"', '\"Oh, what a dear story,\" sighed Anne, wiping away her tears.', '\"What became of Jordan?\" asked Priscilla.', '\"He sold the farm after Hester died and went back to Boston. Mr. Jabez', 'Sloane bought the farm and hauled the little house out to the road.', 'Jordan died about ten years after and he was brought home and buried', 'beside Hester.\"', '\"I can\\'t understand how she could have wanted to live back here, away', 'from everything,\" said Jane.', '\"Oh, I can easily understand THAT,\" said Anne thoughtfully. \"I wouldn\\'t', 'want it myself for a steady thing, because, although I love the fields', 'and woods, I love people too. But I can understand it in Hester. She', 'was tired to death of the noise of the big city and the crowds of people', 'always coming and going and caring nothing for her. She just wanted to', 'escape from it all to some still, green, friendly place where she could', 'rest. And she got just what she wanted, which is something very few', 'people do, I believe. She had four beautiful years before she died. . .', 'four years of perfect happiness, so I think she was to be envied more', 'than pitied. And then to shut your eyes and fall asleep among roses,', 'with the one you loved best on earth smiling down at you . . . oh, I think', 'it was beautiful!\"', '\"She set out those cherry trees over there,\" said Diana. \"She told', \"mother she'd never live to eat their fruit, but she wanted to think that\", 'something she had planted would go on living and helping to make the', 'world beautiful after she was dead.\"', '\"I\\'m so glad we came this way,\" said Anne, the shining-eyed. \"This is', 'my adopted birthday, you know, and this garden and its story is the', 'birthday gift it has given me. Did your mother ever tell you what Hester', 'Gray looked like, Diana?\"', '\"No . . . only just that she was pretty.\"', '\"I\\'m rather glad of that, because I can imagine what she looked like,', 'without being hampered by facts. I think she was very slight and small,', 'with softly curling dark hair and big, sweet, timid brown eyes, and a', 'little wistful, pale face.\"', \"The girls left their baskets in Hester's garden and spent the rest\", 'of the afternoon rambling in the woods and fields surrounding it,', 'discovering many pretty nooks and lanes. When they got hungry they had', 'lunch in the prettiest spot of all . . . on the steep bank of a gurgling', 'brook where white birches shot up out of long feathery grasses. The', \"girls sat down by the roots and did full justice to Anne's dainties,\", 'even the unpoetical sandwiches being greatly appreciated by hearty,', 'unspoiled appetites sharpened by all the fresh air and exercise they had', 'enjoyed. Anne had brought glasses and lemonade for her guests, but for', 'her own part drank cold brook water from a cup fashioned out of birch', 'bark. The cup leaked, and the water tasted of earth, as brook water', 'is apt to do in spring; but Anne thought it more appropriate to the', 'occasion than lemonade.', '\"Look do you see that poem?\" she said suddenly, pointing.', '\"Where?\" Jane and Diana stared, as if expecting to see Runic rhymes on', 'the birch trees.', '\"There . . . down in the brook . . . that old green, mossy log with the', \"water flowing over it in those smooth ripples that look as if they'd\", 'been combed, and that single shaft of sunshine falling right athwart it,', 'far down into the pool. Oh, it\\'s the most beautiful poem I ever saw.\"', '\"I should rather call it a picture,\" said Jane. \"A poem is lines and', 'verses.\"', '\"Oh dear me, no.\" Anne shook her head with its fluffy wild cherry', 'coronal positively. \"The lines and verses are only the outward garments', 'of the poem and are no more really it than your ruffles and flounces are', 'YOU, Jane.

It slips down a lot easier', 'when there\\'s plenty of butter.\"', 'The slice \"slipped down\" with tolerable ease, judging from its rapid', 'disappearance. Davy slid head first off the sofa, turned a double', 'somersault on the rug, and then sat up and announced decidedly,', '\"Anne, I\\'ve made up my mind about heaven. I don\\'t want to go there.\"', '\"Why not?\" asked Anne gravely.', '\"Cause heaven is in Simon Fletcher\\'s garret, and I don\\'t like Simon', 'Fletcher.\"', '\"Heaven in . . .

I wish you could think first and do', \"things afterwards, 'cause then you wouldn't do them. But Milty didn't\", \"mean to be disrespeckful. He just couldn't think of the name of the\", \"thing. Miss Rogerson said heaven was where God was and I wasn't to ask\", \"questions like that.

His mother is Mrs.', \"Simon's sister and he went with her to the funeral when his cousin, Jane\", \"Ellen, died. The minister said she'd gone to heaven, though Milty says\", \"she was lying right before them in the coffin. But he s'posed they\", 'carried the coffin to the garret afterwards.

She was much better fitted for the task than', 'Marilla, for she remembered her own childhood and had an instinctive', 'understanding of the curious ideas that seven-year-olds sometimes get', 'about matters that are, of course, very plain and simple to grown up', 'people. She had just succeeded in convincing Davy that heaven was NOT in', \"Simon Fletcher's garret when Marilla came in from the garden, where she\", 'and Dora had been picking peas. Dora was an industrious little soul and', 'never happier than when \"helping\" in various small tasks suited to her', 'chubby fingers.

She was neat, faithful and observant; she never had', 'to be told how to do a thing twice and never forgot any of her little', 'duties.

So much she saw before the catastrophe came. In', 'her joy Anne forgot the precarious nature of her footing, incautiously', 'ceased to lean on the window sill, gave an impulsive little hop of', 'pleasure . . . and the next moment she had crashed through the roof up', 'to her armpits, and there she hung, quite unable to extricate herself.', 'Diana dashed into the duck house and, seizing her unfortunate friend by', 'the waist, tried to draw her down.', '\"Ow . . . don\\'t,\" shrieked poor Anne. \"There are some long splinters', 'sticking into me.

A thunderstorm seemed a', 'trifle in comparison with what had already happened. \"You\\'d better drive', 'the horse and buggy into that open shed. Fortunately my parasol is in', 'the buggy.

There was not a great', 'deal of thunder, but for the best part of an hour the rain came', 'merrily down. Occasionally Anne slanted back her parasol and waved an', 'encouraging hand to her friend; But conversation at that distance was', 'quite out of the question. Finally the rain ceased, the sun came out,', 'and Diana ventured across the puddles of the yard.', '\"Did you get very wet?\" she asked anxiously.', '\"Oh, no,\" returned Anne cheerfully. \"My head and shoulders are quite', 'dry and my skirt is only a little damp where the rain beat through the', \"lathes. Don't pity me, Diana, for I haven't minded it at all.

Nevertheless, the result was quite pretty, and', 'Diana was \"enraptured\" when Anne read it to her.', '\"Oh, Anne, it\\'s sweet . . . just sweet. DO send it to the \\'Canadian', 'Woman.\\'\"', 'Anne shook her head.', '\"Oh, no, it wouldn\\'t be suitable at all. There is no PLOT in it, you', \"see. It's just a string of fancies.

Oh, there's Miss Sarah Copp now.\", 'PLEASE, Diana, go and explain.\"', 'Miss Sarah Copp was a small person, garbed in shabby black, with a hat', 'chosen less for vain adornment than for qualities that would wear well.', 'She looked as amazed as might be expected on seeing the curious', \"tableau in her yard, but when she heard Diana's explanation she was all\", 'sympathy.

Paul's little\", 'low-ceilinged room was a soft whirl of ruddy light from the sun that was', 'setting over the sea and swinging shadows from the fir trees that grew', 'close to the square, deep-set window. From out this soft glow and glamor', 'shone a sweet, girlish face, with tender mother eyes, that was hanging', 'on the wall at the foot of the bed.', '\"That\\'s my little mother,\" said Paul with loving pride. \"I got Grandma', \"to hang it there where I'd see it as soon as I opened my eyes in the\", 'morning. I never mind not having the light when I go to bed now, because', 'it just seems as if my little mother was right here with me. Father knew', 'just what I would like for a birthday present, although he never asked', 'me. Isn\\'t it wonderful how much fathers DO know?\"', '\"Your mother was very lovely, Paul, and you look a little like her. But', 'her eyes and hair are darker than yours.\"', '\"My eyes are the same color as father\\'s,\" said Paul, flying about the', 'room to heap all available cushions on the window seat, \"but father\\'s', 'hair is gray. He has lots of it, but it is gray. You see, father is', \"nearly fifty. That's ripe old age, isn't it? But it's only OUTSIDE he's\", \"old. INSIDE he's just as young as anybody. Now, teacher, please sit\", \"here; and I'll sit at your feet. May I lay my head against your knee?\", \"That's the way my little mother and I used to sit. Oh, this is real\", 'splendid, I think.\"', '\"Now, I want to hear those thoughts which Mary Joe pronounces so queer,\"', 'said Anne, patting the mop of curls at her side. Paul never needed any', 'coaxing to tell his thoughts . . . at least, to congenial souls.', '\"I thought them out in the fir grove one night,\" he said dreamily. \"Of', \"course I didn't BELIEVE them but I THOUGHT them. YOU know, teacher. And\", 'then I wanted to tell them to somebody and there was nobody but Mary', 'Joe. Mary Joe was in the pantry setting bread and I sat down on the', \"bench beside her and I said, 'Mary Joe, do you know what I think? I\", 'think the evening star is a lighthouse on the land where the fairies', \"dwell.' And Mary Joe said, 'Well, yous are de queer one. Dare ain't no\", \"such ting as fairies.' I was very much provoked. Of course, I knew there\", \"are no fairies; but that needn't prevent my thinking there is. You know,\", \"teacher. But I tried again quite patiently. I said, 'Well then, Mary\", 'Joe, do you know what I think? I think an angel walks over the world', 'after the sun sets . . . a great, tall, white angel, with silvery folded', 'wings . . .  and sings the flowers and birds to sleep. Children can hear', \"him if they know how to listen.' Then Mary Joe held up her hands all\", \"over flour and said, 'Well, yous are de queer leetle boy. Yous make\", \"me feel scare.' And she really did looked scared. I went out then and\", 'whispered the rest of my thoughts to the garden. There was a little', 'birch tree in the garden and it died. Grandma says the salt spray', 'killed it; but I think the dryad belonging to it was a foolish dryad who', 'wandered away to see the world and got lost. And the little tree was so', 'lonely it died of a broken heart.\"', '\"And when the poor, foolish little dryad gets tired of the world and', 'comes back to her tree HER heart will break,\" said Anne.', '\"Yes; but if dryads are foolish they must take the consequences, just as', 'if they were real people,\" said Paul gravely. \"Do you know what I think', 'about the new moon, teacher? I think it is a little golden boat full of', 'dreams.\"', '\"And when it tips on a cloud some of them spill out and fall into your', 'sleep.\"', '\"Exactly, teacher. Oh, you DO know. And I think the violets are little', 'snips of the sky that fell down when the angels cut out holes for the', 'stars to shine through. And the buttercups are made out of old sunshine;', 'and I think the sweet peas will be butterflies when they go to heaven.', 'Now, teacher, do you see anything so very queer about those thoughts?\"', '\"No, laddie dear, they are not queer at all; they are strange and', \"beautiful thoughts for a little boy to think, and so people who couldn't\", 'think anything of the sort themselves, if they tried for a hundred', 'years, think them queer. But keep on thinking them, Paul  . . . some day', 'you are going to be a poet, I believe.\"', 'When Anne reached home she found a very different type of boyhood', 'waiting to be put to bed. Davy was sulky; and when Anne had undressed', 'him he bounced into bed and buried his face in the pillow.', '\"Davy, you have forgotten to say your prayers,\" said Anne rebukingly.', '\"No, I didn\\'t forget,\" said Davy defiantly, \"but I ain\\'t going to say', \"my prayers any more. I'm going to give up trying to be good, 'cause no\", \"matter how good I am you'd like Paul Irving better. So I might as well\", 'be bad and have the fun of it.\"', '\"I don\\'t like Paul Irving BETTER,\" said Anne seriously. \"I like you just', 'as well, only in a different way.\"', '\"But I want you to like me the same way,\" pouted Davy.', '\"You can\\'t like different people the same way. You don\\'t like Dora and', 'me the same way, do you?\"', 'Davy sat up and reflected.', '\"No . . . o . . . o,\" he admitted at last, \"I like Dora because she\\'s my', 'sister but I like you because you\\'re YOU.\"', '\"And I like Paul because he is Paul and Davy because he is Davy,\" said', 'Anne gaily.', '\"Well, I kind of wish I\\'d said my prayers then,\" said Davy, convinced by', 'this logic. \"But it\\'s too much bother getting out now to say them. I\\'ll', 'say them twice over in the morning, Anne. Won\\'t that do as well?\"', 'No, Anne was positive it would not do as well. So Davy scrambled out', 'and knelt down at her knee. When he had finished his devotions he leaned', 'back on his little, bare, brown heels and looked up at her.', '\"Anne, I\\'m gooder than I used to be.\"', '\"Yes, indeed you are, Davy,\" said Anne, who never hesitated to give', 'credit where credit was due.', '\"I KNOW I\\'m gooder,\" said Davy confidently, \"and I\\'ll tell you how I', 'know it. Today Marilla give me two pieces of bread and jam, one for me', 'and one for Dora. One was a good deal bigger than the other and Marilla', \"didn't say which was mine.

She had a', 'sudden realization that Gilbert was a schoolboy no longer. And how manly', 'he looked--the tall, frank-faced fellow, with the clear, straightforward', 'eyes and the broad shoulders. Anne thought Gilbert was a very handsome', \"lad, even though he didn't look at all like her ideal man. She and Diana\", 'had long ago decided what kind of a man they admired and their tastes', 'seemed exactly similar. He must be very tall and distinguished looking,', 'with melancholy, inscrutable eyes, and a melting, sympathetic voice.', \"There was nothing either melancholy or inscrutable in Gilbert's\", \"physiognomy, but of course that didn't matter in friendship!\", 'Gilbert stretched himself out on the ferns beside the Bubble and looked', 'approvingly at Anne. If Gilbert had been asked to describe his ideal', 'woman the description would have answered point for point to Anne, even', 'to those seven tiny freckles whose obnoxious presence still continued to', 'vex her soul. Gilbert was as yet little more than a boy; but a boy has', \"his dreams as have others, and in Gilbert's future there was always a\", 'girl with big, limpid gray eyes, and a face as fine and delicate as a', 'flower. He had made up his mind, also, that his future must be worthy of', 'its goddess. Even in quiet Avonlea there were temptations to be met', 'and faced. White Sands youth were a rather \"fast\" set, and Gilbert was', \"popular wherever he went. But he meant to keep himself worthy of Anne's\", 'friendship and perhaps some distant day her love; and he watched over', 'word and thought and deed as jealously as if her clear eyes were to', 'pass in judgment on it. She held over him the unconscious influence that', 'every girl, whose ideals are high and pure, wields over her friends; an', 'influence which would endure as long as she was faithful to those ideals', 'and which she would as certainly lose if she were ever false to them. In', \"Gilbert's eyes Anne's greatest charm was the fact that she never stooped\", 'to the petty practices of so many of the Avonlea girls--the small', 'jealousies, the little deceits and rivalries, the palpable bids for', 'favor. Anne held herself apart from all this, not consciously or of', 'design, but simply because anything of the sort was utterly foreign', 'to her transparent, impulsive nature, crystal clear in its motives and', 'aspirations.', 'But Gilbert did not attempt to put his thoughts into words, for he had', 'already too good reason to know that Anne would mercilessly and frostily', 'nip all attempts at sentiment in the bud--or laugh at him, which was ten', 'times worse.', '\"You look like a real dryad under that birch tree,\" he said teasingly.', '\"I love birch trees,\" said Anne, laying her cheek against the creamy', 'satin of the slim bole, with one of the pretty, caressing gestures that', 'came so natural to her.', '\"Then you\\'ll be glad to hear that Mr. Major Spencer has decided to set', 'out a row of white birches all along the road front of his farm, by way', 'of encouraging the A.V.I.S.,\" said Gilbert. \"He was talking to me about', 'it today. Major Spencer is the most progressive and public-spirited', 'man in Avonlea. And Mr. William Bell is going to set out a spruce', 'hedge along his road front and up his lane. Our Society is getting on', 'splendidly, Anne. It is past the experimental stage and is an accepted', 'fact. The older folks are beginning to take an interest in it and the', 'White Sands people are talking of starting one too. Even Elisha Wright', 'has come around since that day the Americans from the hotel had the', 'picnic at the shore. They praised our roadsides so highly and said they', 'were so much prettier than in any other part of the Island. And when, in', \"due time, the other farmers follow Mr. Spencer's good example and plant\", 'ornamental trees and hedges along their road fronts Avonlea will be the', 'prettiest settlement in the province.\"', '\"The Aids are talking of taking up the graveyard,\" said Anne, \"and I', 'hope they will, because there will have to be a subscription for that,', 'and it would be no use for the Society to try it after the hall affair.', 'But the Aids would never have stirred in the matter if the Society', \"hadn't put it into their thoughts unofficially.

The floor was swept,', 'the beds made, the hens fed, the muslin dress washed and hung out on the', 'line. Then Anne prepared for the transfer of feathers. She mounted to', 'the garret and donned the first old dress that came to hand . . . a navy', 'blue cashmere she had worn at fourteen. It was decidedly on the short', 'side and as \"skimpy\" as the notable wincey Anne had worn upon the', 'occasion of her debut at Green Gables; but at least it would not be', 'materially injured by down and feathers. Anne completed her toilet by', 'tying a big red and white spotted handkerchief that had belonged to', 'Matthew over her head, and, thus accoutred, betook herself to the', 'kitchen chamber, whither Marilla, before her departure, had helped her', 'carry the feather bed.', 'A cracked mirror hung by the chamber window and in an unlucky moment', 'Anne looked into it. There were those seven freckles on her nose,', 'more rampant than ever, or so it seemed in the glare of light from the', 'unshaded window.', '\"Oh, I forgot to rub that lotion on last night,\" she thought. \"I\\'d', 'better run down to the pantry and do it now.\"', 'Anne had already suffered many things trying to remove those freckles.', 'On one occasion the entire skin had peeled off her nose but the freckles', 'remained. A few days previously she had found a recipe for a freckle', 'lotion in a magazine and, as the ingredients were within her reach, she', 'straightway compounded it, much to the disgust of Marilla, who thought', 'that if Providence had placed freckles on your nose it was your bounden', 'duty to leave them there.', 'Anne scurried down to the pantry, which, always dim from the big willow', 'growing close to the window, was now almost dark by reason of the shade', 'drawn to exclude flies. Anne caught the bottle containing the lotion', 'from the shelf and copiously anointed her nose therewith by means of', 'a little sponge sacred to the purpose. This important duty done, she', 'returned to her work. Any one who has ever shifted feathers from one', 'tick to another will not need to be told that when Anne finished she', 'was a sight to behold. Her dress was white with down and fluff, and her', 'front hair, escaping from under the handkerchief, was adorned with a', 'veritable halo of feathers. At this auspicious moment a knock sounded at', 'the kitchen door.', '\"That must be Mr. Shearer,\" thought Anne. \"I\\'m in a dreadful mess but', 'I\\'ll have to run down as I am, for he\\'s always in a hurry.\"', 'Down flew Anne to the kitchen door. If ever a charitable floor did open', 'to swallow up a miserable, befeathered damsel the Green Gables porch', 'floor should promptly have engulfed Anne at that moment. On the doorstep', 'were standing Priscilla Grant, golden and fair in silk attire, a short,', 'stout gray-haired lady in a tweed suit, and another lady, tall', 'stately, wonderfully gowned, with a beautiful, highbred face and large,', 'black-lashed violet eyes, whom Anne \"instinctively felt,\" as she would', 'have said in her earlier days, to be Mrs. Charlotte E. Morgan.', 'In the dismay of the moment one thought stood out from the confusion of', \"Anne's mind and she grasped at it as at the proverbial straw. All Mrs.\", 'Morgan\\'s heroines were noted for \"rising to the occasion.\" No matter', 'what their troubles were, they invariably rose to the occasion and', 'showed their superiority over all ills of time, space, and quantity.', 'Anne therefore felt it was HER duty to rise to the occasion and she did', 'it, so perfectly that Priscilla afterward declared she never admired', 'Anne Shirley more than at that moment. No matter what her outraged', 'feelings were she did not show them. She greeted Priscilla and was', 'introduced to her companions as calmly and composedly as if she had been', 'arrayed in purple and fine linen.

Presently Anne', 'came down again, clothed and in her right mind.

She had the fire', 'on and the tea steeping when Diana returned; the latter wore HER muslin,', 'at least, and carried a covered platter in her hand.', '\"Mother sent you this,\" she said, lifting the cover and displaying a', \"nicely carved and jointed chicken to Anne's greatful eyes.\", 'The chicken was supplemented by light new bread, excellent butter and', \"cheese, Marilla's fruit cake and a dish of preserved plums, floating\", 'in their golden syrup as in congealed summer sunshine. There was a big', 'bowlful of pink-and-white asters also, by way of decoration; yet the', 'spread seemed very meager beside the elaborate one formerly prepared for', 'Mrs. Morgan.', \"Anne's hungry guests, however, did not seem to think anything was\", 'lacking and they ate the simple viands with apparent enjoyment.

But under all her', 'sparkle there was a strongly felt undercurrent of true, womanly sympathy', 'and kindheartedness which won affection as easily as her brilliancy', 'won admiration. Nor did she monopolize the conversation. She could draw', 'others out as skillfully and fully as she could talk herself, and Anne', 'and Diana found themselves chattering freely to her. Mrs. Pendexter said', 'little; she merely smiled with her lovely eyes and lips, and ate chicken', 'and fruit cake and preserves with such exquisite grace that she conveyed', 'the impression of dining on ambrosia and honeydew. But then, as Anne', 'said to Diana later on, anybody so divinely beautiful as Mrs. Pendexter', \"didn't need to talk; it was enough for her just to LOOK.\", \"After dinner they all had a walk through Lover's Lane and Violet Vale\", \"and the Birch Path, then back through the Haunted Wood to the Dryad's\", 'Bubble, where they sat down and talked for a delightful last half hour.', 'Mrs. Morgan wanted to know how the Haunted Wood came by its name, and', \"laughed until she cried when she heard the story and Anne's dramatic\", 'account of a certain memorable walk through it at the witching hour of', 'twilight.', '\"It has indeed been a feast of reason and flow of soul, hasn\\'t it?\" said', 'Anne, when her guests had gone and she and Diana were alone again. \"I', \"don't know which I enjoyed more . . . listening to Mrs. Morgan or gazing\", \"at Mrs. Pendexter.

The whole house was covered with a luxuriant growth of ivy,', 'finding easy foothold on the rough stonework and turned by autumn frosts', 'to most beautiful bronze and wine-red tints.', 'Before the house was an oblong garden into which the lane gate where', 'the girls were standing opened.

The girls', 'were so surprised that they forgot good manners and simply stared.', 'They had unconsciously been expecting to see the usual type of elderly', 'spinster as known to their experience  . . . a rather angular personage,', 'with prim gray hair and spectacles. Nothing more unlike Miss Lavendar', 'could possibly be imagined.', 'She was a little lady with snow-white hair beautifully wavy and thick,', 'and carefully arranged in becoming puffs and coils.

Charlotta the Fourth is a very good\", 'girl but she WILL let the tea boil.\"', 'Miss Lavendar tripped off to the kitchen on hospitable thoughts intent', 'and the girls found their way up to the spare room, an apartment as', 'white as its door, lighted by the ivy-hung dormer window and looking, as', 'Anne said, like the place where happy dreams grew.', '\"This is quite an adventure, isn\\'t it?\" said Diana. \"And isn\\'t Miss', \"Lavendar sweet, if she IS a little odd? She doesn't look a bit like an\", 'old maid.\"', '\"She looks just as music sounds, I think,\" answered Anne.', 'When they went down Miss Lavendar was carrying in the teapot, and behind', 'her, looking vastly pleased, was Charlotta the Fourth, with a plate of', 'hot biscuits.', '\"Now, you must tell me your names,\" said Miss Lavendar. \"I\\'m so glad you', \"are young girls.

Her name isn't really Charlotta at all.\", \"It is . . . let me see . . . what is it? I THINK it's Leonora . . . yes, it\", 'IS Leonora. You see, it is this way. When mother died ten years ago I', \"couldn't stay here alone . . .  and I couldn't afford to pay the wages of\", 'a grown-up girl. So I got little Charlotta Bowman to come and stay with', 'me for board and clothes. Her name really was Charlotta . . . she was', 'Charlotta the First. She was just thirteen.

Nevertheless, Anne keenly', 'enjoyed her walk through the great gray maze of the beechlands; though', 'alone she never found it lonely; her imagination peopled her path', 'with merry companions, and with these she carried on a gay, pretended', 'conversation that was wittier and more fascinating than conversations', 'are apt to be in real life, where people sometimes fail most lamentably', 'to talk up to the requirements. In a \"make believe\" assembly of choice', 'spirits everybody says just the thing you want her to say and so gives', 'you the chance to say just what YOU want to say.

Miss Lavendar dropped her voice as if she were about to confess a', 'predilection for murdering people, \"that I am a dreadfully sulky person.', \"Oh, you needn't smile, . . .  it's only too true.

Perhaps, after all, romance did not', \"come into one's life with pomp and blare, like a gay knight riding down;\", \"perhaps it crept to one's side like an old friend through quiet ways;\", 'perhaps it revealed itself in seeming prose, until some sudden shaft of', 'illumination flung athwart its pages betrayed the rhythm and the music,', 'perhaps . . .  perhaps . . . love unfolded naturally out of a beautiful', 'friendship, as a golden-hearted rose slipping from its green sheath.', 'Then the veil dropped again; but the Anne who walked up the dark lane', 'was not quite the same Anne who had driven gaily down it the evening', 'before. The page of girlhood had been turned, as by an unseen finger,', 'and the page of womanhood was before her with all its charm and mystery,', 'its pain and gladness.', 'Gilbert wisely said nothing more; but in his silence he read the history', \"of the next four years in the light of Anne's remembered blush.

the sandy margin,', 'Till the Black-Robe chief, the Pale-face,', 'With the cross upon his bosom,', 'Landed on the sandy margin.', 'Then the joyous Hiawatha', 'Cried aloud and spake in this wise:', '\"Beautiful is the sun, O strangers,', 'When you come so far to see us!', 'All our town in peace awaits you,', 'All our doors stand open for you;', 'You shall enter all our wigwams,', \"For the heart's right hand we give you.\", '\"Never bloomed the earth so gayly,', 'Never shone the sun so brightly,', 'As to-day they shine and blossom', 'When you come so far to see us!', 'Never was our lake so tranquil,', 'Nor so free from rocks, and sand-bars;', 'For your birch canoe in passing', 'Has removed both rock and sand-bar.', '\"Never before had our tobacco', 'Such a sweet and pleasant flavor,', 'Never the broad leaves of our cornfields', 'Were so beautiful to look on,', 'As they seem to us this morning,', 'When you come so far to see us!\"', 'And the Black-Robe chief made answer,', 'Stammered in his speech a little,', 'Speaking words yet unfamiliar:', '\"Peace be with you, Hiawatha,', 'Peace be with you and your people,', 'Peace of prayer, and peace of pardon,', 'Peace of Christ, and joy of Mary!\"', 'Then the generous Hiawatha', 'Led the strangers to his wigwam,', 'Seated them on skins of bison,', 'Seated them on skins of ermine,', 'And the careful old Nokomis', 'Brought them food in bowls of basswood,', 'Water brought in birchen dippers,', 'And the calumet, the peace-pipe,', 'Filled and lighted for their smoking.', 'All the old men of the village,', 'All the warriors of the nation,', 'All the Jossakeeds, the Prophets,', 'The magicians, the Wabenos,', 'And the Medicine-men, the Medas,', 'Came to bid the strangers welcome;', '\"It is well\", they said, \"O brothers,', 'That you come so far to see us!\"', 'In a circle round the doorway,', 'With their pipes they sat in silence,', 'Waiting to behold the strangers,', 'Waiting to receive their message;', 'Till the Black-Robe chief, the Pale-face,', 'From the wigwam came to greet them,', 'Stammering in his speech a little,', 'Speaking words yet unfamiliar;', '\"It is well,\" they said, \"O brother,', 'That you come so far to see us!\"', 'Then the Black-Robe chief, the Prophet,', 'Told his message to the people,', 'Told the purport of his mission,', 'Told them of the Virgin Mary,', 'And her blessed Son, the Saviour,', 'How in distant lands and ages', 'He had lived on earth as we do;', 'How he fasted, prayed, and labored;', 'How the Jews, the tribe accursed,', 'Mocked him, scourged him, crucified him;', 'How he rose from where they laid him,', 'Walked again with his disciples,', 'And ascended into heaven.', 'And the chiefs made answer, saying:', '\"We have listened to your message,', 'We have heard your words of wisdom,', 'We will think on what you tell us.', 'It is well for us, O brothers,', 'That you come so far to see us!\"', 'Then they rose up and departed', 'Each one homeward to his wigwam,', 'To the young men and the women', 'Told the story of the strangers', 'Whom the Master of Life had sent them', 'From the shining land of Wabun.', 'Heavy with the heat and silence', 'Grew the afternoon of Summer;', 'With a drowsy sound the forest', 'Whispered round the sultry wigwam,', 'With a sound of sleep the water', 'Rippled on the beach below it;', 'From the cornfields shrill and ceaseless', 'Sang the grasshopper, Pah-puk-keena;', 'And the guests of Hiawatha,', 'Weary with the heat of Summer,', 'Slumbered in the sultry wigwam.', \"Slowly o'er the simmering landscape\", \"Fell the evening's dusk and coolness,\", 'And the long and level sunbeams', 'Shot their spears into the forest,', 'Breaking through its shields of shadow,', 'Rushed into each secret ambush,', 'Searched each thicket, dingle, hollow;', 'Still the guests of Hiawatha', 'Slumbered in the silent wigwam.', 'From his place rose Hiawatha,', 'Bade farewell to old Nokomis,', 'Spake in whispers, spake in this wise,', 'Did not wake the guests, that slumbered.', '\"I am going, O Nokomis,', 'On a long and distant journey,', 'To the portals of the Sunset.', 'To the regions of the home-wind,', 'Of the Northwest-Wind, Keewaydin.', 'But these guests I leave behind me,', 'In your watch and ward I leave them;', 'See that never harm comes near them,', 'See that never fear molests them,', 'Never danger nor suspicion,', 'Never want of food or shelter,', 'In the lodge of Hiawatha!\"', 'Forth into the village went he,', 'Bade farewell to all the warriors,', 'Bade farewell to all the young men,', 'Spake persuading, spake in this wise:', '\"I am going, O my people,', 'On a long and distant journey;', 'Many moons and many winters', 'Will have come, and will have vanished,', 'Ere I come again to see you.', 'But my guests I leave behind me;', 'Listen to their words of wisdom,', 'Listen to the truth they tell you,', 'For the Master of Life has sent them', 'From the land of light and morning!\"', 'On the shore stood Hiawatha,', 'Turned and waved his hand at parting;', 'On the clear and luminous water', 'Launched his birch canoe for sailing,', 'From the pebbles of the margin', 'Shoved it forth into the water;', 'Whispered to it, \"Westward! westward!\"', 'And with speed it darted forward.', 'And the evening sun descending', 'Set the clouds on fire with redness,', 'Burned the broad sky, like a prairie,', 'Left upon the level water', 'One long track and trail of splendor,', 'Down whose stream, as down a river,', 'Westward, westward Hiawatha', 'Sailed into the fiery sunset,', 'Sailed into the purple vapors,', 'Sailed into the dusk of evening:', 'And the people from the margin', 'Watched him floating, rising, sinking,', 'Till the birch canoe seemed lifted', 'High into that sea of splendor,', 'Till it sank into the vapors', 'Like the new moon slowly, slowly', 'Sinking in the purple distance.', 'And they said, \"Farewell forever!\"', 'Said, \"Farewell, O Hiawatha!\"', 'And the forests, dark and lonely,', 'Moved through all their depths of darkness,', 'Sighed, \"Farewell, O Hiawatha!\"', 'And the waves upon the margin', 'Rising, rippling on the pebbles,', 'Sobbed, \"Farewell, O Hiawatha!\"', 'And the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,', 'From her haunts among the fen-lands,', 'Screamed, \"Farewell, O Hiawatha!\"', 'Thus departed Hiawatha,', 'Hiawatha the Beloved,', 'In
