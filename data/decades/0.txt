SCENE I. London. The Parliament House Alarum. Enter DUKE OF YORK, EDWARD, RICHARD, NORFOLK, MONTAGUE, WARWICK, and soldiers, with white roses in their hats   WARWICK. I wonder how the King escap'd our hands.   YORK. While we pursu'd the horsemen of the north,     He slily stole away and left his men;     Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,     Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,     Cheer'd up the drooping army, and himself,     Lord Clifford, and Lord Stafford, all abreast,     Charg'd our main battle's front, and, breaking in,     Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.   EDWARD. Lord Stafford's father, Duke of Buckingham,     Is either slain or wounded dangerous;     I cleft his beaver with a downright blow.     That this is true, father, behold his blood.   MONTAGUE. And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood,     Whom I encount'red as the battles join'd.   RICHARD. Speak thou for me, and tell them what I did.                                  [Throwing down SOMERSET'S head]   YORK. Richard hath best deserv'd of all my sons.     But is your Grace dead, my Lord of Somerset?   NORFOLK. Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!   RICHARD. Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.   WARWICK. And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,     Before I see thee seated in that throne     Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,     I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.     This is the palace of the fearful King,     And this the regal seat. Possess it, York;     For this is thine, and not King Henry's heirs'.   YORK. Assist me then, sweet Warwick, and I will;     For hither we have broken in by force.   NORFOLK. We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.   YORK. Thanks, gentle Norfolk. Stay by me, my lords;     And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night.                                                     [They go up]   WARWICK. And when the King comes, offer him no violence.     Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.   YORK. The Queen this day here holds her parliament,     But little thinks we shall be of her council.     By words or blows here let us win our right.   RICHARD. Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house.   WARWICK. The bloody parliament shall this be call'd,     Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be King,     And bashful Henry depos'd, whose cowardice     Hath made us by-words to our enemies.   YORK. Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute:     I mean to take possession of my right.   WARWICK. Neither the King, nor he that loves him best,     The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,     Dares stir a wing if Warwick shake his bells.     I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares.     Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.                                       [YORK occupies the throne]        Flourish. Enter KING HENRY, CLIFFORD, NORTHUMBERLAND,         WESTMORELAND, EXETER, and others, with red roses in                             their hats   KING HENRY. My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,     Even in the chair of state! Belike he means,     Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false peer,     To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.     Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father;     And thine, Lord Clifford; and you both have vow'd revenge     On him, his sons, his favourites, and his friends.   NORTHUMBERLAND. If I be not, heavens be reveng'd on me!   CLIFFORD. The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.   WESTMORELAND. What, shall we suffer this? Let's pluck him down;     My heart for anger burns; I cannot brook it.   KING HENRY. Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.   CLIFFORD. Patience is for poltroons such as he;     He durst not sit there had your father liv'd.     My gracious lord, here in the parliament     Let us assail the family of York.   NORTHUMBERLAND. Well hast thou spoken, cousin; be it so.   KING HENRY. Ah, know you not the city favours them,     And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?   EXETER. But when the Duke is slain they'll quickly fly.   KING HENRY. Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,     To make a shambles of the parliament house!     Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words, and threats,     Shall be the war that Henry means to use.     Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne     And kneel for grace and mercy at my feet;     I am thy sovereign.   YORK. I am thine.   EXETER. For shame, come down; he made thee Duke of York.   YORK. 'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was.   EXETER. Thy father was a traitor to the crown.   WARWICK. Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown     In following this usurping Henry.   CLIFFORD. Whom should he follow but his natural king?   WARWICK. True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York.   KING HENRY. And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?   YORK. It must and shall be so; content thyself.   WARWICK. Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be King.   WESTMORELAND. He is both King and Duke of Lancaster;     And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.   WARWICK. And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget     That we are those which chas'd you from the field,     And slew your fathers, and with colours spread     March'd through the city to the palace gates.   NORTHUMBERLAND. Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;     And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.   WESTMORELAND. Plantagenet, of thee, and these thy sons,     Thy kinsmen, and thy friends, I'll have more lives     Than drops of blood were in my father's veins.   CLIFFORD. Urge it no more; lest that instead of words     I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger     As shall revenge his death before I stir.   WARWICK. Poor Clifford, how I scorn his worthless threats!   YORK. Will you we show our title to the crown?     If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.   KING HENRY. What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?     Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York;     Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:     I am the son of Henry the Fifth,     Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop,     And seiz'd upon their towns and provinces.   WARWICK. Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.   KING HENRY. The Lord Protector lost it, and not I:     When I was crown'd, I was but nine months old.   RICHARD. You are old enough now, and yet methinks you lose.     Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head.   EDWARD. Sweet father, do so; set it on your head.   MONTAGUE. Good brother, as thou lov'st and honourest arms,     Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus.   RICHARD. Sound drums and trumpets, and the King will fly.   YORK. Sons, peace!   KING HENRY. Peace thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.   WARWICK. Plantagenet shall speak first. Hear him, lords;     And be you silent and attentive too,     For he that interrupts him shall not live.   KING HENRY. Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,     Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?     No; first shall war unpeople this my realm;     Ay, and their colours, often borne in France,     And now in England to our heart's great sorrow,     Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?     My title's good, and better far than his.   WARWICK. Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be King.   KING HENRY. Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.   YORK. 'Twas by rebellion against his king.   KING HENRY. [Aside] I know not what to say; my title's weak.-     Tell me, may not a king adopt an heir?   YORK. What then?   KING HENRY. An if he may, then am I lawful King;     For Richard, in the view of many lords,     Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth,     Whose heir my father was, and I am his.   YORK. He rose against him, being his sovereign,     And made him to resign his crown perforce.   WARWICK. Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,     Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown?   EXETER. No; for he could not so resign his crown     But that the next heir should succeed and reign.   KING HENRY. Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?   EXETER. His is the right, and therefore pardon me.   YORK. Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?   EXETER. My conscience tells me he is lawful King.   KING HENRY. [Aside] All will revolt from me, and turn to him.   NORTHUMBERLAND. Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,     Think not that Henry shall be so depos'd.   WARWICK. Depos'd he shall be, in despite of all.   NORTHUMBERLAND. Thou art deceiv'd. 'Tis not thy southern power     Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,     Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,     Can set the Duke up in despite of me.   CLIFFORD. King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,     Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence.     May that ground gape, and swallow me alive,     Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!   KING HENRY. O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!   YORK. Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.     What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords?   WARWICK. Do right unto this princely Duke of York;     Or I will fill the house with armed men,     And over the chair of state, where now he sits,     Write up his title with usurping blood.                                 [He stamps with his foot and the                                        soldiers show themselves]   KING HENRY. My Lord of Warwick, hear but one word:     Let me for this my life-time reign as king.   YORK. Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,     And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou liv'st.   KING HENRY. I am content. Richard Plantagenet,     Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.   CLIFFORD. What wrong is this unto the Prince your son!   WARWICK. What good is this to England and himself!   WESTMORELAND. Base, fearful, and despairing Henry!   CLIFFORD. How hast thou injur'd both thyself and or us!   WESTMORELAND. I cannot stay to hear these articles.   NORTHUMBERLAND. Nor I.   CLIFFORD. Come, cousin, let us tell the Queen these news.   WESTMORELAND. Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,     In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides.   NORTHUMBERLAND. Be thou a prey unto the house of York     And die in bands for this unmanly deed!   CLIFFORD. In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,     Or live in peace abandon'd and despis'd!                                 Exeunt NORTHUMBERLAND, CLIFFORD,                                                 and WESTMORELAND   WARWICK. Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.   EXETER. They seek revenge, and therefore will not yield.   KING HENRY. Ah, Exeter!   WARWICK. Why should you sigh, my lord?   KING HENRY. Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,     Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit.     But be it as it may. [To YORK] I here entail     The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever;     Conditionally, that here thou take an oath     To cease this civil war, and, whilst I live,     To honour me as thy king and sovereign,     And neither by treason nor hostility     To seek to put me down and reign thyself.   YORK. This oath I willingly take, and will perform.                                         [Coming from the throne]   WARWICK. Long live King Henry! Plantagenet, embrace him.   KING HENRY. And long live thou, and these thy forward sons!   YORK. Now York and Lancaster are reconcil'd.   EXETER. Accurs'd be he that seeks to make them foes!                                    [Sennet. Here they come down]   YORK. Farewell, my gracious lord; I'll to my castle.   WARWICK. And I'll keep London with my soldiers.   NORFOLK. And I to Norfolk with my followers.   MONTAGUE. And I unto the sea, from whence I came.                                              Exeunt the YORKISTS   KING HENRY. And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court.             Enter QUEEN MARGARET and the PRINCE OF WALES   EXETER. Here comes the Queen, whose looks bewray her anger.     I'll steal away.   KING HENRY. Exeter, so will I.   QUEEN MARGARET. Nay, go not from me; I will follow thee.   KING HENRY. Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.   QUEEN MARGARET. Who can be patient in such extremes?     Ah, wretched man! Would I had died a maid,     And never seen thee, never borne thee son,     Seeing thou hast prov'd so unnatural a father!     Hath he deserv'd to lose his birthright thus?     Hadst thou but lov'd him half so well as I,     Or felt that pain which I did for him once,     Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood,     Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there     Rather than have made that savage duke thine heir,     And disinherited thine only son.   PRINCE OF WALES. Father, you cannot disinherit me.     If you be King, why should not I succeed?   KING HENRY. Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet son.     The Earl of Warwick and the Duke enforc'd me.   QUEEN MARGARET. Enforc'd thee! Art thou King and wilt be       forc'd?     I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch!     Thou hast undone thyself, thy son, and me;     And giv'n unto the house of York such head     As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.     To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,     What is it but to make thy sepulchre     And creep into it far before thy time?     Warwick is Chancellor and the lord of Calais;     Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas;     The Duke is made Protector of the realm;     And yet shalt thou be safe? Such safety finds     The trembling lamb environed with wolves.     Had I been there, which am a silly woman,     The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes     Before I would have granted to that act.     But thou prefer'st thy life before thine honour;     And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself,     Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,     Until that act of parliament be repeal'd     Whereby my son is disinherited.     The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours     Will follow mine, if once they see them spread;     And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace     And utter ruin of the house of York.     Thus do I leave thee. Come, son, let's away;     Our army is ready; come, we'll after them.   KING HENRY. Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.   QUEEN MARGARET. Thou hast spoke too much already; get thee gone.   KING HENRY. Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?   QUEEN MARGARET. Ay, to be murder'd by his enemies.   PRINCE OF WALES. When I return with victory from the field     I'll see your Grace; till then I'll follow her.   QUEEN MARGARET. Come, son, away; we may not linger thus.                             Exeunt QUEEN MARGARET and the PRINCE   KING HENRY. Poor queen! How love to me and to her son     Hath made her break out into terms of rage!     Reveng'd may she be on that hateful Duke,     Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,     Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle     Tire on the flesh of me and of my son!     The loss of those three lords torments my heart.     I'll write unto them, and entreat them fair;     Come, cousin, you shall be the messenger.   EXETER. And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all.        Exeunt SCENE II. Sandal Castle, near Wakefield, in Yorkshire Flourish. Enter EDWARD, RICHARD, and MONTAGUE   RICHARD. Brother, though I be youngest, give me leave.   EDWARD. No, I can better play the orator.   MONTAGUE. But I have reasons strong and forcible.                      Enter the DUKE OF YORK   YORK. Why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife?     What is your quarrel? How began it first?   EDWARD. No quarrel, but a slight contention.   YORK. About what?   RICHARD. About that which concerns your Grace and us-     The crown of England, father, which is yours.   YORK. Mine, boy? Not till King Henry be dead.   RICHARD. Your right depends not on his life or death.   EDWARD. Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now.     By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe,     It will outrun you, father, in the end.   YORK. I took an oath that he should quietly reign.   EDWARD. But for a kingdom any oath may be broken:     I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year.   RICHARD. No; God forbid your Grace should be forsworn.   YORK. I shall be, if I claim by open war.   RICHARD. I'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak.   YORK. Thou canst not, son; it is impossible.   RICHARD. An oath is of no moment, being not took     Before a true and lawful magistrate     That hath authority over him that swears.     Henry had none, but did usurp the place;     Then, seeing 'twas he that made you to depose,     Your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous.     Therefore, to arms. And, father, do but think     How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown,     Within whose circuit is Elysium     And all that poets feign of bliss and joy.     Why do we linger thus? I cannot rest     Until the white rose that I wear be dy'd     Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's heart.   YORK. Richard, enough; I will be King, or die.     Brother, thou shalt to London presently     And whet on Warwick to this enterprise.     Thou, Richard, shalt to the Duke of Norfolk     And tell him privily of our intent.     You, Edward, shall unto my Lord Cobham,     With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise;     In them I trust, for they are soldiers,     Witty, courteous, liberal, full of spirit.     While you are thus employ'd, what resteth more     But that I seek occasion how to rise,     And yet the King not privy to my drift,     Nor any of the house of Lancaster?                       Enter a MESSENGER     But, stay. What news? Why com'st thou in such post?   MESSENGER. The Queen with all the northern earls and lords     Intend here to besiege you in your castle.     She is hard by with twenty thousand men;     And therefore fortify your hold, my lord.   YORK. Ay, with my sword. What! think'st thou that we fear them?     Edward and Richard, you shall stay with me;     My brother Montague shall post to London.     Let noble Warwick, Cobham, and the rest,     Whom we have left protectors of the King,     With pow'rful policy strengthen themselves     And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths.   MONTAGUE. Brother, I go; I'll win them, fear it not.     And thus most humbly I do take my leave.                Exit               Enter SIR JOHN and SIR HUGH MORTIMER   YORK. Sir john and Sir Hugh Mortimer, mine uncles!     You are come to Sandal in a happy hour;     The army of the Queen mean to besiege us.   SIR JOHN. She shall not need; we'll meet her in the field.   YORK. What, with five thousand men?   RICHARD. Ay, with five hundred, father, for a need.     A woman's general; what should we fear?                                               [A march afar off]   EDWARD. I hear their drums. Let's set our men in order,     And issue forth and bid them battle straight.   YORK. Five men to twenty! Though the odds be great,     I doubt not, uncle, of our victory.     Many a battle have I won in France,     When as the enemy hath been ten to one;     Why should I not now have the like success?           Exeunt SCENE III. Field of battle between Sandal Castle and Wakefield Alarum. Enter RUTLAND and his TUTOR   RUTLAND. Ah, whither shall I fly to scape their hands?     Ah, tutor, look where bloody Clifford comes!                   Enter CLIFFORD and soldiers   CLIFFORD. Chaplain, away! Thy priesthood saves thy life.     As for the brat of this accursed duke,     Whose father slew my father, he shall die.   TUTOR. And I, my lord, will bear him company.   CLIFFORD. Soldiers, away with him!   TUTOR. Ah, Clifford, murder not this innocent child,     Lest thou be hated both of God and man.                                     Exit, forced off by soldiers   CLIFFORD. How now, is he dead already? Or is it fear     That makes him close his eyes? I'll open them.   RUTLAND. So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch     That trembles under his devouring paws;     And so he walks, insulting o'er his prey,     And so he comes, to rend his limbs asunder.     Ah, gentle Clifford, kill me with thy sword,     And not with such a cruel threat'ning look!     Sweet Clifford, hear me speak before I die.     I am too mean a subject for thy wrath;     Be thou reveng'd on men, and let me live.   CLIFFORD. In vain thou speak'st, poor boy; my father's blood     Hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter.   RUTLAND. Then let my father's blood open it again:     He is a man, and, Clifford, cope with him.   CLIFFORD. Had I thy brethren here, their lives and thine     Were not revenge sufficient for me;     No, if I digg'd up thy forefathers' graves     And hung their rotten coffins up in chains,     It could not slake mine ire nor ease my heart.     The sight of any of the house of York     Is as a fury to torment my soul;     And till I root out their accursed line     And leave not one alive, I live in hell.     Therefore-   RUTLAND. O, let me pray before I take my death!     To thee I pray: sweet Clifford, pity me.   CLIFFORD. Such pity as my rapier's point affords.   RUTLAND. I never did thee harm; why wilt thou slay me?   CLIFFORD. Thy father hath.   RUTLAND. But 'twas ere I was born.     Thou hast one son; for his sake pity me,     Lest in revenge thereof, sith God is just,     He be as miserably slain as I.     Ah, let me live in prison all my days;     And when I give occasion of offence     Then let me die, for now thou hast no cause.   CLIFFORD. No cause!     Thy father slew my father; therefore, die.       [Stabs him]   RUTLAND. Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae!         [Dies]   CLIFFORD. Plantagenet, I come, Plantagenet;     And this thy son's blood cleaving to my blade     Shall rust upon my weapon, till thy blood,     Congeal'd with this, do make me wipe off both.          Exit SCENE IV. Another part of the field Alarum. Enter the DUKE OF YORK   YORK. The army of the Queen hath got the field.     My uncles both are slain in rescuing me;     And all my followers to the eager foe     Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind,     Or lambs pursu'd by hunger-starved wolves.     My sons- God knows what hath bechanced them;     But this I know- they have demean'd themselves     Like men born to renown by life or death.     Three times did Richard make a lane to me,     And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out.'     And full as oft came Edward to my side     With purple falchion, painted to the hilt     In blood of those that had encount'red him.     And when the hardiest warriors did retire,     Richard cried 'Charge, and give no foot of ground!'     And cried 'A crown, or else a glorious tomb!     A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'     With this we charg'd again; but out alas!     We bodg'd again; as I have seen a swan     With bootless labour swim against the tide     And spend her strength with over-matching waves.                                          [A short alarum within]     Ah, hark! The fatal followers do pursue,     And I am faint and cannot fly their fury;     And were I strong, I would not shun their fury.     The sands are numb'red that make up my life;     Here must I stay, and here my life must end.          Enter QUEEN MARGARET, CLIFFORD, NORTHUMBERLAND,                the PRINCE OF WALES, and soldiers     Come, bloody Clifford, rough Northumberland,     I dare your quenchless fury to more rage;     I am your butt, and I abide your shot.   NORTHUMBERLAND. Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet.   CLIFFORD. Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm     With downright payment show'd unto my father.     Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car,     And made an evening at the noontide prick.   YORK. My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth     A bird that will revenge upon you all;     And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven,     Scorning whate'er you can afflict me with.     Why come you not? What! multitudes, and fear?   CLIFFORD. So cowards fight when they can fly no further;     So doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons;     So desperate thieves, all hopeless of their lives,     Breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers.   YORK. O Clifford, but bethink thee once again,     And in thy thought o'errun my former time;     And, if thou canst for blushing, view this face,     And bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice     Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this!   CLIFFORD. I will not bandy with thee word for word,     But buckler with thee blows, twice two for one.   QUEEN MARGARET. Hold, valiant Clifford; for a thousand causes     I would prolong awhile the traitor's life.     Wrath makes him deaf; speak thou, Northumberland.   NORTHUMBERLAND. Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much     To prick thy finger, though to wound his heart.     What valour were it, when a cur doth grin,     For one to thrust his hand between his teeth,     When he might spurn him with his foot away?     It is war's prize to take all vantages;     And ten to one is no impeach of valour.                          [They lay hands on YORK, who struggles]   CLIFFORD. Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin.   NORTHUMBERLAND. So doth the cony struggle in the net.   YORK. So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty;     So true men yield, with robbers so o'er-match'd.   NORTHUMBERLAND. What would your Grace have done unto him now?   QUEEN MARGARET. Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,     Come, make him stand upon this molehill here     That raught at mountains with outstretched arms,     Yet parted but the shadow with his hand.     What, was it you that would be England's king?     Was't you that revell'd in our parliament     And made a preachment of your high descent?     Where are your mess of sons to back you now?     The wanton Edward and the lusty George?     And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy,     Dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voice     Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?     Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland?     Look, York: I stain'd this napkin with the blood     That valiant Clifford with his rapier's point     Made issue from the bosom of the boy;     And if thine eyes can water for his death,     I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.     Alas, poor York! but that I hate thee deadly,     I should lament thy miserable state.     I prithee grieve to make me merry, York.     What, hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails     That not a tear can fall for Rutland's death?     Why art thou patient, man? Thou shouldst be mad;     And I to make thee mad do mock thee thus.     Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance.     Thou wouldst be fee'd, I see, to make me sport;     York cannot speak unless he wear a crown.     A crown for York!-and, lords, bow low to him.     Hold you his hands whilst I do set it on.                              [Putting a paper crown on his head]     Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king!     Ay, this is he that took King Henry's chair,     And this is he was his adopted heir.     But how is it that great Plantagenet     Is crown'd so soon and broke his solemn oath?     As I bethink me, you should not be King     Till our King Henry had shook hands with death.     And will you pale your head in Henry's glory,     And rob his temples of the diadem,     Now in his life, against your holy oath?     O, 'tis a fault too too     Off with the crown and with the crown his head;     And, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead.   CLIFFORD. That is my office, for my father's sake.   QUEEN MARGARET. Nay, stay; let's hear the orisons he makes.   YORK. She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France,     Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth!     How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex     To triumph like an Amazonian trull     Upon their woes whom fortune captivates!     But that thy face is visard-like, unchanging,     Made impudent with use of evil deeds,     I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush.     To tell thee whence thou cam'st, of whom deriv'd,     Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.     Thy father bears the type of King of Naples,     Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem,     Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.     Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?     It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen;     Unless the adage must be verified,     That beggars mounted run their horse to death.     'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;     But, God He knows, thy share thereof is small.     'Tis virtue that doth make them most admir'd;     The contrary doth make thee wond'red at.     'Tis government that makes them seem divine;     The want thereof makes thee abominable.     Thou art as opposite to every good     As the Antipodes are unto us,     Or as the south to the septentrion.     O tiger's heart wrapp'd in a woman's hide!     How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,     To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,     And yet be seen to bear a woman's face?     Women are soft, mild, pitiful, and flexible:     Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless.     Bid'st thou me rage? Why, now thou hast thy wish;     Wouldst have me weep? Why, now thou hast thy will;     For raging wind blows up incessant showers,     And when the rage allays, the rain begins.     These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies;     And every drop cries vengeance for his death     'Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false Frenchwoman.   NORTHUMBERLAND. Beshrew me, but his passions move me so     That hardly can I check my eyes from tears.   YORK. That face of his the hungry cannibals     Would not have touch'd, would not have stain'd with blood;     But you are more inhuman, more inexorable-     O, ten times more- than tigers of Hyrcania.     See, ruthless queen, a hapless father's tears.     This cloth thou dipp'dst in blood of my sweet boy,     And I with tears do wash the blood away.     Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this;     And if thou tell'st the heavy story right,     Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears;     Yea, even my foes will shed fast-falling tears     And say 'Alas, it was a piteous deed!'     There, take the crown, and with the crown my curse;     And in thy need such comfort come to thee     As now I reap at thy too cruel hand!     Hard-hearted Clifford, take me from the world;     My soul to heaven, my blood upon your heads!   NORTHUMBERLAND. Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin,     I should not for my life but weep with him,     To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul.   QUEEN MARGARET. What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland?     Think but upon the wrong he did us all,     And that will quickly dry thy melting tears.   CLIFFORD. Here's for my oath, here's for my father's death.                                                   [Stabbing him]   QUEEN MARGARET. And here's to right our gentle-hearted king.                                                   [Stabbing him]   YORK. Open Thy gate of mercy, gracious God!     My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee.                                                           [Dies]   QUEEN MARGARET. Off with his head, and set it on York gates;     So York may overlook the town of York.                                                 Flourish. Exeunt ACT II. SCENE I. A plain near Mortimer's Cross in Herefordshire A march. Enter EDWARD, RICHARD, and their power   EDWARD. I wonder how our princely father scap'd,     Or whether he be scap'd away or no     From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit.     Had he been ta'en, we should have heard the news;     Had he been slain, we should have heard the news;     Or had he scap'd, methinks we should have heard     The happy tidings of his good escape.     How fares my brother? Why is he so sad?   RICHARD. I cannot joy until I be resolv'd     Where our right valiant father is become.     I saw him in the battle range about,     And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth.     Methought he bore him in the thickest troop     As doth a lion in a herd of neat;     Or as a bear, encompass'd round with dogs,     Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry,     The rest stand all aloof and bark at him.     So far'd our father with his enemies;     So fled his enemies my warlike father.     Methinks 'tis prize enough to be his son.     See how the morning opes her golden gates     And takes her farewell of the glorious sun.     How well resembles it the prime of youth,     Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love!   EDWARD. Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?   RICHARD. Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;     Not separated with the racking clouds,     But sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky.     See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,     As if they vow'd some league inviolable.     Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.     In this the heaven figures some event.   EDWARD. 'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.     I think it cites us, brother, to the field,     That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,     Each one already blazing by our meeds,     Should notwithstanding join our lights together     And overshine the earth, as this the world.     Whate'er it bodes, henceforward will I bear     Upon my target three fair shining suns.   RICHARD. Nay, bear three daughters- by your leave I speak it,     You love the breeder better than the male.                  Enter a MESSENGER, blowing     But what art thou, whose heavy looks foretell     Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue?   MESSENGER. Ah, one that was a woeful looker-on     When as the noble Duke of York was slain,     Your princely father and my loving lord!   EDWARD. O, speak no more! for I have heard too much.   RICHARD. Say how he died, for I will hear it all.   MESSENGER. Environed he was with many foes,     And stood against them as the hope of Troy     Against the Greeks that would have ent'red Troy.     But Hercules himself must yield to odds;     And many strokes, though with a little axe,     Hews down and fells the hardest-timber'd oak.     By many hands your father was subdu'd;     But only slaught'red by the ireful arm     Of unrelenting Clifford and the Queen,     Who crown'd the gracious Duke in high despite,     Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept,     The ruthless Queen gave him to dry his cheeks     A napkin steeped in the harmless blood     Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain;     And after many scorns, many foul taunts,     They took his head, and on the gates of York     They set the same; and there it doth remain,     The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd.   EDWARD. Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,     Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.     O Clifford, boist'rous Clifford, thou hast slain     The flow'r of Europe for his chivalry;     And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him,     For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee.     Now my soul's palace is become a prison.     Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body     Might in the ground be closed up in rest!     For never henceforth shall I joy again;     Never, O never, shall I see more joy.   RICHARD. I cannot weep, for all my body's moisture     Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart;     Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burden,     For self-same wind that I should speak withal     Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,     And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.     To weep is to make less the depth of grief.     Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me!     Richard, I bear thy name; I'll venge thy death,     Or die renowned by attempting it.   EDWARD. His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;     His dukedom and his chair with me is left.   RICHARD. Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,     Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun;     For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom, say:     Either that is thine, or else thou wert not his.          March. Enter WARWICK, MONTAGUE, and their army   WARWICK. How now, fair lords! What fare? What news abroad?   RICHARD. Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount     Our baleful news and at each word's deliverance     Stab poinards in our flesh till all were told,     The words would add more anguish than the wounds.     O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!   EDWARD. O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet     Which held thee dearly as his soul's redemption     Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.   WARWICK. Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears;     And now, to add more measure to your woes,     I come to tell you things sith then befall'n.     After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,     Where your brave father breath'd his latest gasp,     Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,     Were brought me of your loss and his depart.     I, then in London, keeper of the King,     Muster'd my soldiers, gathered flocks of friends,     And very well appointed, as I thought,     March'd toward Saint Albans to intercept the Queen,     Bearing the King in my behalf along;     For by my scouts I was advertised     That she was coming with a full intent     To dash our late decree in parliament     Touching King Henry's oath and your succession.     Short tale to make- we at Saint Albans met,     Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought;     But whether 'twas the coldness of the King,     Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen,     That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen,     Or whether 'twas report of her success,     Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,     Who thunders to his captives blood and death,     I cannot judge; but, to conclude with truth,     Their weapons like to lightning came and went:     Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight     Or like an idle thresher with a flail,     Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.     I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,     With promise of high pay and great rewards,     But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,     And we in them no hope to win the day;     So that we fled: the King unto the Queen;     Lord George your brother, Norfolk, and myself,     In haste post-haste are come to join with you;     For in the marches here we heard you were     Making another head to fight again.   EDWARD. Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?     And when came George from Burgundy to England?   WARWICK. Some six miles off the Duke is with the soldiers;     And for your brother, he was lately sent     From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,     With aid of soldiers to this needful war.   RICHARD. 'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled.     Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,     But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.   WARWICK. Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;     For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine     Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head     And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,     Were he as famous and as bold in war     As he is fam'd for mildness, peace, and prayer.   RICHARD. I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not.     'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.     But in this troublous time what's to be done?     Shall we go throw away our coats of steel     And wrap our bodies in black mourning-gowns,     Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads?     Or shall we on the helmets of our foes     Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?     If for the last, say 'Ay,' and to it, lords.   WARWICK. Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;     And therefore comes my brother Montague.     Attend me, lords. The proud insulting Queen,     With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,     And of their feather many moe proud birds,     Have wrought the easy-melting King like wax.     He swore consent to your succession,     His oath enrolled in the parliament;     And now to London all the crew are gone     To frustrate both his oath and what beside     May make against the house of Lancaster.     Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong.     Now if the help of Norfolk and myself,     With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,     Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,     Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,     Why, Via! to London will we march amain,     And once again bestride our foaming steeds,     And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!'     But never once again turn back and fly.   RICHARD. Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak.     Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day     That cries 'Retire!' if Warwick bid him stay.   EDWARD. Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;     And when thou fail'st- as God forbid the hour!-     Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend.   WARWICK. No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York;     The next degree is England's royal throne,     For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd     In every borough as we pass along;     And he that throws not up his cap for joy     Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.     King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,     Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,     But sound the trumpets and about our task.   RICHARD. Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,     As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,     I come to pierce it or to give thee mine.   EDWARD. Then strike up drums. God and Saint George for us!                        Enter a MESSENGER   WARWICK. How now! what news?   MESSENGER. The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me     The Queen is coming with a puissant host,     And craves your company for speedy counsel.   WARWICK. Why, then it sorts; brave warriors, let's away.                                                           Exeunt SCENE II. Before York Flourish. Enter KING HENRY, QUEEN MARGARET, the PRINCE OF WALES, CLIFFORD, NORTHUMBERLAND, with drum and trumpets   QUEEN MARGARET. Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.     Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy     That sought to be encompass'd with your crown.     Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?   KING HENRY. Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck-     To see this sight, it irks my very soul.     Withhold revenge, dear God; 'tis not my fault,     Nor wittingly have I infring'd my vow.   CLIFFORD. My gracious liege, this too much lenity     And harmful pity must be laid aside.     To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?     Not to the beast that would usurp their den.     Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?     Not his that spoils her young before her face.     Who scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?     Not he that sets his foot upon her back,     The smallest worm will turn, being trodden on,     And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.     Ambitious York did level at thy crown,     Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows.     He, but a Duke, would have his son a king,     And raise his issue like a loving sire:     Thou, being a king, bless'd with a goodly son,     Didst yield consent to disinherit him,     Which argued thee a most unloving father.     Unreasonable creatures feed their young;     And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,     Yet, in protection of their tender ones,     Who hath not seen them- even with those wings     Which sometime they have us'd with fearful flight-     Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest,     Offering their own lives in their young's defence     For shame, my liege, make them your precedent!     Were it not pity that this goodly boy     Should lose his birthright by his father's fault,     And long hereafter say unto his child     'What my great-grandfather and grandsire got     My careless father fondly gave away'?     Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy;     And let his manly face, which promiseth     Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart     To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.   KING HENRY. Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,     Inferring arguments of mighty force.     But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear     That things ill got had ever bad success?     And happy always was it for that son     Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?     I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind;     And would my father had left me no more!     For all the rest is held at such a rate     As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep     Than in possession any jot of pleasure.     Ah, cousin York! would thy best friends did know     How it doth grieve me that thy head is here!   QUEEN MARGARET. My lord, cheer up your spirits; our foes are nigh,     And this soft courage makes your followers faint.     You promis'd knighthood to our forward son:     Unsheathe your sword and dub him presently.     Edward, kneel down.   KING HENRY. Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;     And learn this lesson: Draw thy sword in right.   PRINCE OF WALES. My gracious father, by your kingly leave,     I'll draw it as apparent to the crown,     And in that quarrel use it to the death.   CLIFFORD. Why, that is spoken like a toward prince.                       Enter a MESSENGER   MESSENGER. Royal commanders, be in readiness;     For with a band of thirty thousand men     Comes Warwick, backing of the Duke of York,     And in the towns, as they do march along,     Proclaims him king, and many fly to him.     Darraign your battle, for they are at hand.   CLIFFORD. I would your Highness would depart the field:     The Queen hath best success when you are absent.   QUEEN MARGARET. Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune.   KING HENRY. Why, that's my fortune too; therefore I'll stay.   NORTHUMBERLAND. Be it with resolution, then, to fight.   PRINCE OF WALES. My royal father, cheer these noble lords,     And hearten those that fight in your defence.     Unsheathe your sword, good father; cry 'Saint George!'          March. Enter EDWARD, GEORGE, RICHARD, WARWICK,                 NORFOLK, MONTAGUE, and soldiers   EDWARD. Now, perjur'd Henry, wilt thou kneel for grace     And set thy diadem upon my head,     Or bide the mortal fortune of the field?   QUEEN MARGARET. Go rate thy minions, proud insulting boy.     Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms     Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?   EDWARD. I am his king, and he should bow his knee.     I was adopted heir by his consent:     Since when, his oath is broke; for, as I hear,     You that are King, though he do wear the crown,     Have caus'd him by new act of parliament     To blot out me and put his own son in.   CLIFFORD. And reason too:     Who should succeed the father but the son?   RICHARD. Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!   CLIFFORD. Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,     Or any he, the proudest of thy sort.   RICHARD. 'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?   CLIFFORD. Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.   RICHARD. For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.   WARWICK. What say'st thou, Henry? Wilt thou yield the crown?   QUEEN MARGARET. Why, how now, long-tongu'd Warwick! Dare you speak?     When you and I met at Saint Albans last     Your legs did better service than your hands.   WARWICK. Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.   CLIFFORD. You said so much before, and yet you fled.   WARWICK. 'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.   NORTHUMBERLAND. No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.   RICHARD. Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.     Break off the parley; for scarce I can refrain     The execution of my big-swol'n heart     Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer.   CLIFFORD. I slew thy father; call'st thou him a child?   RICHARD. Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,     As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland;     But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed.   KING HENRY. Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.   QUEEN MARGARET. Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.   KING HENRY. I prithee give no limits to my tongue:     I am a king, and privileg'd to speak.   CLIFFORD. My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here     Cannot be cur'd by words; therefore be still.   RICHARD. Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword.     By Him that made us all, I am resolv'd     That Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue.   EDWARD. Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?     A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day     That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.   WARWICK. If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;     For York in justice puts his armour on.   PRINCE OF WALES. If that be right which Warwick says is right,     There is no wrong, but every thing is right.   RICHARD. Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands;     For well I wot thou hast thy mother's tongue.   QUEEN MARGARET. But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;     But like a foul misshapen stigmatic,     Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided,     As venom toads or lizards' dreadful stings.   RICHARD. Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,     Whose father bears the title of a king-     As if a channel should be call'd the sea-     Sham'st thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,     To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?   EDWARD. A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns     To make this shameless callet know herself.     Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,     Although thy husband may be Menelaus;     And ne'er was Agamemmon's brother wrong'd     By that false woman as this king by thee.     His father revell'd in the heart of France,     And tam'd the King, and made the Dauphin stoop;     And had he match'd according to his state,     He might have kept that glory to this day;     But when he took a beggar to his bed     And grac'd thy poor sire with his bridal day,     Even then that sunshine brew'd a show'r for him     That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France     And heap'd sedition on his crown at home.     For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?     Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept;     And we, in pity of the gentle King,     Had slipp'd our claim until another age.   GEORGE. But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,     And that thy summer bred us no increase,     We set the axe to thy usurping root;     And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,     Yet know thou, since we have begun to strike,     We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down,     Or bath'd thy growing with our heated bloods.   EDWARD. And in this resolution I defy thee;     Not willing any longer conference,     Since thou deniest the gentle King to speak.     Sound trumpets; let our bloody colours wave,     And either victory or else a grave!   QUEEN MARGARET. Stay, Edward.   EDWARD. No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay;     These words will cost ten thousand lives this day.                                                           Exeunt SCENE III. A field of battle between Towton and Saxton, in Yorkshire Alarum; excursions. Enter WARWICK   WARWICK. Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,     I lay me down a little while to breathe;     For strokes receiv'd and many blows repaid     Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,     And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile.                      Enter EDWARD, running   EDWARD. Smile, gentle heaven, or strike, ungentle death;     For this world frowns, and Edward's sun is clouded.   WARWICK. How now, my lord. What hap? What hope of good?                          Enter GEORGE   GEORGE. Our hap is lost, our hope but sad despair;     Our ranks are broke, and ruin follows us.     What counsel give you? Whither shall we fly?   EDWARD. Bootless is flight: they follow us with wings;     And weak we are, and cannot shun pursuit.                          Enter RICHARD   RICHARD. Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself?     Thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk,     Broach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance;     And in the very pangs of death he cried,     Like to a dismal clangor heard from far,     'Warwick, revenge! Brother, revenge my death.'     So, underneath the belly of their steeds,     That stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood,     The noble gentleman gave up the ghost.   WARWICK. Then let the earth be drunken with our blood.     I'll kill my horse, because I will not fly.     Why stand we like soft-hearted women here,     Wailing our losses, whiles the foe doth rage,     And look upon, as if the tragedy     Were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors?     Here on my knee I vow to God above     I'll never pause again, never stand still,     Till either death hath clos'd these eyes of mine     Or fortune given me measure of revenge.   EDWARD. O Warwick, I do bend my knee with thine,     And in this vow do chain my soul to thine!     And ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face     I throw my hands, mine eyes, my heart to Thee,     Thou setter-up and plucker-down of kings,     Beseeching Thee, if with Thy will it stands     That to my foes this body must be prey,     Yet that Thy brazen gates of heaven may ope     And give sweet passage to my sinful soul.     Now, lords, take leave until we meet again,     Where'er it be, in heaven or in earth.   RICHARD. Brother, give me thy hand; and, gentle Warwick,     Let me embrace thee in my weary arms.     I that did never weep now melt with woe     That winter should cut off our spring-time so.   WARWICK. Away, away! Once more, sweet lords, farewell.   GEORGE. Yet let us all together to our troops,     And give them leave to fly that will not stay,     And call them pillars that will stand to us;     And if we thrive, promise them such rewards     As victors wear at the Olympian games.     This may plant courage in their quailing breasts,     For yet is hope of life and victory.     Forslow no longer; make we hence amain.               Exeunt SCENE IV. Another part of the field Excursions. Enter RICHARD and CLIFFORD   RICHARD. Now, Clifford, I have singled thee alone.     Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York,     And this for Rutland; both bound to revenge,     Wert thou environ'd with a brazen wall.   CLIFFORD. Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone.     This is the hand that stabbed thy father York;     And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland;     And here's the heart that triumphs in their death     And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother     To execute the like upon thyself;     And so, have at thee!                           [They fight]                  Enter WARWICK; CLIFFORD flies   RICHARD. Nay, Warwick, single out some other chase;     For I myself will hunt this wolf to death.            Exeunt SCENE V. Another part of the field Alarum. Enter KING HENRY alone   KING HENRY. This battle fares like to the morning's war,     When dying clouds contend with growing light,     What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,     Can neither call it perfect day nor night.     Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea     Forc'd by the tide to combat with the wind;     Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea     Forc'd to retire by fury of the wind.     Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;     Now one the better, then another best;     Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,     Yet neither conqueror nor conquered.     So is the equal poise of this fell war.     Here on this molehill will I sit me down.     To whom God will, there be the victory!     For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,     Have chid me from the battle, swearing both     They prosper best of all when I am thence.     Would I were dead, if God's good will were so!     For what is in this world but grief and woe?     O God! methinks it were a happy life     To be no better than a homely swain;     To sit upon a hill, as I do now,     To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,     Thereby to see the minutes how they run-     How many makes the hour full complete,     How many hours brings about the day,     How many days will finish up the year,     How many years a mortal man may live.     When this is known, then to divide the times-     So many hours must I tend my flock;     So many hours must I take my rest;     So many hours must I contemplate;     So many hours must I sport myself;     So many days my ewes have been with young;     So many weeks ere the poor fools will can;     So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:     So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,     Pass'd over to the end they were created,     Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.     Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!     Gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade     To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,     Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy     To kings that fear their subjects' treachery?     O yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.     And to conclude: the shepherd's homely curds,     His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle,     His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,     All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,     Is far beyond a prince's delicates-     His viands sparkling in a golden cup,     His body couched in a curious bed,     When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.        Alarum. Enter a son that hath kill'd his Father, at        one door; and a FATHER that hath kill'd his Son, at                          another door   SON. Ill blows the wind that profits nobody.     This man whom hand to hand I slew in fight     May be possessed with some store of crowns;     And I, that haply take them from him now,     May yet ere night yield both my life and them     To some man else, as this dead man doth me.     Who's this? O God! It is my father's face,     Whom in this conflict I unwares have kill'd.     O heavy times, begetting such events!     From London by the King was I press'd forth;     My father, being the Earl of Warwick's man,     Came on the part of York, press'd by his master;     And I, who at his hands receiv'd my life,     Have by my hands of life bereaved him.     Pardon me, God, I knew not what I did.     And pardon, father, for I knew not thee.     My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks;     And no more words till they have flow'd their fill.   KING HENRY. O piteous spectacle! O bloody times!     Whiles lions war and battle for their dens,     Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity.     Weep, wretched man; I'll aid thee tear for tear;     And let our hearts and eyes, like civil war,     Be blind with tears and break o'ercharg'd with grief.                Enter FATHER, bearing of his SON   FATHER. Thou that so stoutly hath resisted me,     Give me thy gold, if thou hast any gold;     For I have bought it with an hundred blows.     But let me see. Is this our foeman's face?     Ah, no, no, no, no, it is mine only son!     Ah, boy, if any life be left in thee,     Throw up thine eye! See, see what show'rs arise,     Blown with the windy tempest of my heart     Upon thy wounds, that kills mine eye and heart!     O, pity, God, this miserable age!     What stratagems, how fell, how butcherly,     Erroneous, mutinous, and unnatural,     This deadly quarrel daily doth beget!     O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon,     And hath bereft thee of thy life too late!   KING HENRY. Woe above woe! grief more than common grief!     O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!     O pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity!     The red rose and the white are on his face,     The fatal colours of our striving houses:     The one his purple blood right well resembles;     The other his pale cheeks, methinks, presenteth.     Wither one rose, and let the other flourish!     If you contend, a thousand lives must perish.   SON. How will my mother for a father's death     Take on with me, and ne'er be satisfied!   FATHER. How will my wife for slaughter of my son     Shed seas of tears, and ne'er be satisfied!   KING HENRY. How will the country for these woeful chances     Misthink the King, and not be satisfied!   SON. Was ever son so rued a father's death?   FATHER. Was ever father so bemoan'd his son?   KING HENRY. Was ever king so griev'd for subjects' woe?     Much is your sorrow; mine ten times so much.   SON. I'll bear thee hence, where I may weep my fill.                                               Exit with the body   FATHER. These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet;     My heart, sweet boy, shall be thy sepulchre,     For from my heart thine image ne'er shall go;     My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell;     And so obsequious will thy father be,     Even for the loss of thee, having no more,     As Priam was for all his valiant sons.     I'll bear thee hence; and let them fight that will,     For I have murdered where I should not kill.                                               Exit with the body   KING HENRY. Sad-hearted men, much overgone with care,     Here sits a king more woeful than you are.            Alarums, excursions. Enter QUEEN MARGARET,                   PRINCE OF WALES, and EXETER   PRINCE OF WALES. Fly, father, fly; for all your friends are fled,     And Warwick rages like a chafed bull.     Away! for death doth hold us in pursuit.   QUEEN MARGARET. Mount you, my lord; towards Berwick post amain.     Edward and Richard, like a brace of greyhounds     Having the fearful flying hare in sight,     With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath,     And bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands,     Are at our backs; and therefore hence amain.   EXETER. Away! for vengeance comes along with them.     Nay, stay not to expostulate; make speed;     Or else come after. I'll away before.   KING HENRY. Nay, take me with thee, good sweet Exeter.     Not that I fear to stay, but love to go     Whither the Queen intends. Forward; away!             Exeunt SCENE VI. Another part of the field A loud alarum. Enter CLIFFORD, wounded   CLIFFORD. Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,     Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light.     O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow     More than my body's parting with my soul!     My love and fear glu'd many friends to thee;     And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts,     Impairing Henry, strength'ning misproud York.     The common people swarm like summer flies;     And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?     And who shines now but Henry's enemies?     O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent     That Phaethon should check thy fiery steeds,     Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!     And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,     Or as thy father and his father did,     Giving no ground unto the house of York,     They never then had sprung like summer flies;     I and ten thousand in this luckless realm     Had left no mourning widows for our death;     And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.     For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?     And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?     Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds.     No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight.     The foe is merciless and will not pity;     For at their hands I have deserv'd no pity.     The air hath got into my deadly wounds,     And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.     Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest;     I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms: split my breast.                                                      [He faints]        Alarum and retreat. Enter EDWARD, GEORGE, RICHARD                MONTAGUE, WARWICK, and soldiers   EDWARD. Now breathe we, lords. Good fortune bids us pause     And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks.     Some troops pursue the bloody-minded Queen     That led calm Henry, though he were a king,     As doth a sail, fill'd with a fretting gust,     Command an argosy to stern the waves.     But think you, lords, that Clifford fled with them?   WARWICK. No, 'tis impossible he should escape;     For, though before his face I speak the words,     Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave;     And, whereso'er he is, he's surely dead.                                      [CLIFFORD groans, and dies]   RICHARD. Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?     A deadly groan, like life and death's departing.     See who it is.   EDWARD. And now the battle's ended,     If friend or foe, let him be gently used.   RICHARD. Revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis Clifford;     Who not contented that he lopp'd the branch     In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth,     But set his murd'ring knife unto the root     From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring-     I mean our princely father, Duke of York.   WARWICK. From off the gates of York fetch down the head,     Your father's head, which Clifford placed there;     Instead whereof let this supply the room.     Measure for measure must be answered.   EDWARD. Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,     That nothing sung but death to us and ours.     Now death shall stop his dismal threat'ning sound,     And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.   WARWICK. I think his understanding is bereft.     Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?     Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life,     And he nor sees nor hears us what we say.   RICHARD. O, would he did! and so, perhaps, he doth.     'Tis but his policy to counterfeit,     Because he would avoid such bitter taunts     Which in the time of death he gave our father.   GEORGE. If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words.   RICHARD. Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.   EDWARD. Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.   WARWICK. Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.   GEORGE. While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.   RICHARD. Thou didst love York, and I am son to York.   EDWARD. Thou pitied'st Rutland, I will pity thee.   GEORGE. Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now?   WARWICK. They mock thee, Clifford; swear as thou wast wont.   RICHARD. What, not an oath? Nay, then the world goes hard     When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.     I know by that he's dead; and by my soul,     If this right hand would buy two hours' life,     That I in all despite might rail at him,     This hand should chop it off, and with the issuing blood     Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst     York and young Rutland could not satisfy.   WARWICK. Ay, but he's dead. Off with the traitor's head,     And rear it in the place your father's stands.     And now to London with triumphant march,     There to be crowned England's royal King;     From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France,     And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen.     So shalt thou sinew both these lands together;     And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread     The scatt'red foe that hopes to rise again;     For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,     Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears.     First will I see the coronation;     And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea     To effect this marriage, so it please my lord.   EDWARD. Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;     For in thy shoulder do I build my seat,     And never will I undertake the thing     Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting.     Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester;     And George, of Clarence; Warwick, as ourself,     Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best.   RICHARD. Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester;     For Gloucester's dukedom is too ominous.   WARWICK. Tut, that's a foolish observation.     Richard, be Duke of Gloucester. Now to London     To see these honours in possession.                   Exeunt ACT III. SCENE I. A chase in the north of England Enter two KEEPERS, with cross-bows in their hands   FIRST KEEPER. Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves,     For through this laund anon the deer will come;     And in this covert will we make our stand,     Culling the principal of all the deer.   SECOND KEEPER. I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.   FIRST KEEPER. That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow     Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost.     Here stand we both, and aim we at the best;     And, for the time shall not seem tedious,     I'll tell thee what befell me on a day     In this self-place where now we mean to stand.   SECOND KEEPER. Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.         Enter KING HENRY, disguised, with a prayer-book   KING HENRY. From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,     To greet mine own land with my wishful sight.     No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine;     Thy place is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung from thee,     Thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed.     No bending knee will call thee Caesar now,     No humble suitors press to speak for right,     No, not a man comes for redress of thee;     For how can I help them and not myself?   FIRST KEEPER. Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee.     This is the quondam King; let's seize upon him.   KING HENRY. Let me embrace thee, sour adversity,     For wise men say it is the wisest course.   SECOND KEEPER. Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.   FIRST KEEPER. Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more.   KING HENRY. My Queen and son are gone to France for aid;     And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick     Is thither gone to crave the French King's sister     To wife for Edward. If this news be true,     Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;     For Warwick is a subtle orator,     And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.     By this account, then, Margaret may win him;     For she's a woman to be pitied much.     Her sighs will make a batt'ry in his breast;     Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;     The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;     And Nero will be tainted with remorse     To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.     Ay, but she's come to beg: Warwick, to give.     She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry:     He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward.     She weeps, and says her Henry is depos'd:     He smiles, and says his Edward is install'd;     That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;     Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,     Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,     And in conclusion wins the King from her     With promise of his sister, and what else,     To strengthen and support King Edward's place.     O Margaret, thus 'twill be; and thou, poor soul,     Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn!   SECOND KEEPER. Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?   KING HENRY. More than I seem, and less than I was born to:     A man at least, for less I should not be;     And men may talk of kings, and why not I?   SECOND KEEPER. Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.   KING HENRY. Why, so I am- in mind; and that's enough.   SECOND KEEPER. But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?   KING HENRY. My crown is in my heart, not on my head;     Not deck'd with diamonds and Indian stones,     Not to be seen. My crown is call'd content;     A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.   SECOND KEEPER. Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,     Your crown content and you must be contented     To go along with us; for as we think,     You are the king King Edward hath depos'd;     And we his subjects, sworn in all allegiance,     Will apprehend you as his enemy.   KING HENRY. But did you never swear, and break an oath?   SECOND KEEPER. No, never such an oath; nor will not now.   KING HENRY. Where did you dwell when I was King of England?   SECOND KEEPER. Here in this country, where we now remain.   KING HENRY. I was anointed king at nine months old;     My father and my grandfather were kings;     And you were sworn true subjects unto me;     And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?   FIRST KEEPER. No;     For we were subjects but while you were king.   KING HENRY. Why, am I dead? Do I not breathe a man?     Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!     Look, as I blow this feather from my face,     And as the air blows it to me again,     Obeying with my wind when I do blow,     And yielding to another when it blows,     Commanded always by the greater gust,     Such is the lightness of you common men.     But do not break your oaths; for of that sin     My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.     Go where you will, the King shall be commanded;     And be you kings: command, and I'll obey.   FIRST KEEPER. We are true subjects to the King, King Edward.   KING HENRY. So would you be again to Henry,     If he were seated as King Edward is.   FIRST KEEPER. We charge you, in God's name and the King's,     To go with us unto the officers.   KING HENRY. In God's name, lead; your King's name be obey'd;     And what God will, that let your King perform;     And what he will, I humbly yield unto.                Exeunt SCENE II. London. The palace Enter KING EDWARD, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and LADY GREY   KING EDWARD. Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Albans' field     This lady's husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain,     His land then seiz'd on by the conqueror.     Her suit is now to repossess those lands;     Which we in justice cannot well deny,     Because in quarrel of the house of York     The worthy gentleman did lose his life.   GLOUCESTER. Your Highness shall do well to grant her suit;     It were dishonour to deny it her.   KING EDWARD. It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.   GLOUCESTER. [Aside to CLARENCE] Yea, is it so?     I see the lady hath a thing to grant,     Before the King will grant her humble suit.   CLARENCE. [Aside to GLOUCESTER] He knows the game; how true he     keeps the wind!   GLOUCESTER. [Aside to CLARENCE] Silence!   KING EDWARD. Widow, we will consider of your suit;     And come some other time to know our mind.   LADY GREY. Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay.     May it please your Highness to resolve me now;     And what your pleasure is shall satisfy me.   GLOUCESTER. [Aside] Ay, widow? Then I'll warrant you all your       lands,     An if what pleases him shall pleasure you.     Fight closer or, good faith, you'll catch a blow.   CLARENCE. [Aside to GLOUCESTER] I fear her not, unless she chance     to fall.   GLOUCESTER. [Aside to CLARENCE] God forbid that, for he'll take     vantages.   KING EDWARD. How many children hast thou, widow, tell me.   CLARENCE. [Aside to GLOUCESTER] I think he means to beg a child of     her.   GLOUCESTER. [Aside to CLARENCE] Nay, then whip me; he'll rather     give her two.   LADY GREY. Three, my most gracious lord.   GLOUCESTER. [Aside] You shall have four if you'll be rul'd by him.   KING EDWARD. 'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands.   LADY GREY. Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it, then.   KING EDWARD. Lords, give us leave; I'll try this widow's wit.   GLOUCESTER. [Aside] Ay, good leave have you; for you will have       leave     Till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch.                               [GLOUCESTER and CLARENCE withdraw]   KING EDWARD. Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?   LADY GREY. Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.   KING EDWARD. And would you not do much to do them good?   LADY GREY. To do them good I would sustain some harm.   KING EDWARD. Then get your husband's lands, to do them good.   LADY GREY. Therefore I came unto your Majesty.   KING EDWARD. I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.   LADY GREY. So shall you bind me to your Highness' service.   KING EDWARD. What service wilt thou do me if I give them?   LADY GREY. What you command that rests in me to do.   KING EDWARD. But you will take exceptions to my boon.   LADY GREY. No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.   KING EDWARD. Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.   LADY GREY. Why, then I will do what your Grace commands.   GLOUCESTER. He plies her hard; and much rain wears the marble.   CLARENCE. As red as fire! Nay, then her wax must melt.   LADY GREY. Why stops my lord? Shall I not hear my task?   KING EDWARD. An easy task; 'tis but to love a king.   LADY GREY. That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject.   KING EDWARD. Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee.   LADY GREY. I take my leave with many thousand thanks.   GLOUCESTER. The match is made; she seals it with a curtsy.   KING EDWARD. But stay thee- 'tis the fruits of love I mean.   LADY GREY. The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.   KING EDWARD. Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.     What love, thinkst thou, I sue so much to get?   LADY GREY. My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;     That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.   KING EDWARD. No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.   LADY GREY. Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.   KING EDWARD. But now you partly may perceive my mind.   LADY GREY. My mind will never grant what I perceive     Your Highness aims at, if I aim aright.   KING EDWARD. To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee.   LADY GREY. To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.   KING EDWARD. Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands.   LADY GREY. Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower;     For by that loss I will not purchase them.   KING EDWARD. Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.   LADY GREY. Herein your Highness wrongs both them and me.     But, mighty lord, this merry inclination     Accords not with the sadness of my suit.     Please you dismiss me, either with ay or no.   KING EDWARD. Ay, if thou wilt say ay to my request;     No, if thou dost say no to my demand.   LADY GREY. Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.   GLOUCESTER. The widow likes him not; she knits her brows.   CLARENCE. He is the bluntest wooer in Christendom.   KING EDWARD. [Aside] Her looks doth argue her replete with modesty;     Her words doth show her wit incomparable;     All her perfections challenge sovereignty.     One way or other, she is for a king;     And she shall be my love, or else my queen.     Say that King Edward take thee for his queen?   LADY GREY. 'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord.     I am a subject fit to jest withal,     But far unfit to be a sovereign.   KING EDWARD. Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee     I speak no more than what my soul intends;     And that is to enjoy thee for my love.   LADY GREY. And that is more than I will yield unto.     I know I am too mean to be your queen,     And yet too good to be your concubine.   KING EDWARD. You cavil, widow; I did mean my queen.   LADY GREY. 'Twill grieve your Grace my sons should call you father.   KING EDWARD.No more than when my daughters call thee mother.     Thou art a widow, and thou hast some children;     And, by God's Mother, I, being but a bachelor,     Have other some. Why, 'tis a happy thing     To be the father unto many sons.     Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen.   GLOUCESTER. The ghostly father now hath done his shrift.   CLARENCE. When he was made a shriver, 'twas for shrift.   KING EDWARD. Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.   GLOUCESTER. The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad.   KING EDWARD. You'd think it strange if I should marry her.   CLARENCE. To who, my lord?   KING EDWARD. Why, Clarence, to myself.   GLOUCESTER. That would be ten days' wonder at the least.   CLARENCE. That's a day longer than a wonder lasts.   GLOUCESTER. By so much is the wonder in extremes.   KING EDWARD. Well, jest on, brothers; I can tell you both     Her suit is granted for her husband's lands.                        Enter a NOBLEMAN   NOBLEMAN. My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken     And brought your prisoner to your palace gate.   KING EDWARD. See that he be convey'd unto the Tower.     And go we, brothers, to the man that took him     To question of his apprehension.     Widow, go you along. Lords, use her honourably.                                        Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER   GLOUCESTER. Ay, Edward will use women honourably.     Would he were wasted, marrow, bones, and all,     That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring     To cross me from the golden time I look for!     And yet, between my soul's desire and me-     The lustful Edward's title buried-     Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward,     And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies,     To take their rooms ere I can place myself.     A cold premeditation for my purpose!     Why, then I do but dream on sovereignty;     Like one that stands upon a promontory     And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,     Wishing his foot were equal with his eye;     And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,     Saying he'll lade it dry to have his way-     So do I wish the crown, being so far off;     And so I chide the means that keeps me from it;     And so I say I'll cut the causes off,     Flattering me with impossibilities.     My eye's too quick, my heart o'erweens too much,     Unless my hand and strength could equal them.     Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard;     What other pleasure can the world afford?     I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,     And deck my body in gay ornaments,     And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.     O miserable thought! and more unlikely     Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns.     Why, love forswore me in my mother's womb;     And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,     She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe     To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub     To make an envious mountain on my back,     Where sits deformity to mock my body;     To shape my legs of an unequal size;     To disproportion me in every part,     Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp     That carries no impression like the dam.     And am I, then, a man to be belov'd?     O monstrous fault to harbour such a thought!     Then, since this earth affords no joy to me     But to command, to check, to o'erbear such     As are of better person than myself,     I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,     And whiles I live t' account this world but hell,     Until my misshap'd trunk that bear this head     Be round impaled with a glorious crown.     And yet I know not how to get the crown,     For many lives stand between me and home;     And I- like one lost in a thorny wood     That rents the thorns and is rent with the thorns,     Seeking a way and straying from the way     Not knowing how to find the open air,     But toiling desperately to find it out-     Torment myself to catch the English crown;     And from that torment I will free myself     Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.     Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,     And cry 'Content!' to that which grieves my heart,     And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,     And frame my face to all occasions.     I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;     I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;     I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,     Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,     And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.     I can add colours to the chameleon,     Change shapes with Protheus for advantages,     And set the murderous Machiavel to school.     Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?     Tut, were it farther off, I'll pluck it down.           Exit SCENE III. France.  The KING'S palace Flourish.  Enter LEWIS the French King, his sister BONA, his Admiral call'd BOURBON; PRINCE EDWARD, QUEEN MARGARET, and the EARL of OXFORD.  LEWIS sits, and riseth up again   LEWIS. Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,     Sit down with us. It ill befits thy state     And birth that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.   QUEEN MARGARET. No, mighty King of France. Now Margaret     Must strike her sail and learn a while to serve     Where kings command. I was, I must confess,     Great Albion's Queen in former golden days;     But now mischance hath trod my title down     And with dishonour laid me on the ground,     Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,     And to my humble seat conform myself.   LEWIS. Why, say, fair Queen, whence springs this deep despair?   QUEEN MARGARET. From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears     And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares.   LEWIS. Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,     And sit thee by our side. [Seats her by him] Yield not thy neck     To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind     Still ride in triumph over all mischance.     Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief;     It shall be eas'd, if France can yield relief.   QUEEN MARGARET. Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts     And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.     Now therefore be it known to noble Lewis     That Henry, sole possessor of my love,     Is, of a king, become a banish'd man,     And forc'd to live in Scotland a forlorn;     While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York     Usurps the regal title and the seat     Of England's true-anointed lawful King.     This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,     With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir,     Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;     And if thou fail us, all our hope is done.     Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help;     Our people and our peers are both misled,     Our treasure seiz'd, our soldiers put to flight,     And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.   LEWIS. Renowned Queen, with patience calm the storm,     While we bethink a means to break it off.   QUEEN MARGARET. The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.   LEWIS. The more I stay, the more I'll succour thee.   QUEEN MARGARET. O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.     And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!                         Enter WARWICK   LEWIS. What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?   QUEEN MARGARET. Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.   LEWIS. Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?                                       [He descends. She ariseth]   QUEEN MARGARET. Ay, now begins a second storm to rise;     For this is he that moves both wind and tide.   WARWICK. From worthy Edward, King of Albion,     My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,     I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,     First to do greetings to thy royal person,     And then to crave a league of amity,     And lastly to confirm that amity     With nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant     That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,     To England's King in lawful marriage.   QUEEN MARGARET. [Aside] If that go forward, Henry's hope is done.   WARWICK. [To BONA] And, gracious madam, in our king's behalf,     I am commanded, with your leave and favour,     Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue     To tell the passion of my sovereign's heart;     Where fame, late ent'ring at his heedful ears,     Hath plac'd thy beauty's image and thy virtue.   QUEEN MARGARET. King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak     Before you answer Warwick. His demand     Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love,     But from deceit bred by necessity;     For how can tyrants safely govern home     Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?     To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,     That Henry liveth still; but were he dead,     Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son.     Look therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage     Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;     For though usurpers sway the rule a while     Yet heav'ns are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.   WARWICK. Injurious Margaret!   PRINCE OF WALES. And why not Queen?   WARWICK. Because thy father Henry did usurp;     And thou no more art prince than she is queen.   OXFORD. Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,     Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;     And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,     Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;     And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,     Who by his prowess conquered all France.     From these our Henry lineally descends.   WARWICK. Oxford, how haps it in this smooth discourse     You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost     All that which Henry the Fifth had gotten?     Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.     But for the rest: you tell a pedigree     Of threescore and two years- a silly time     To make prescription for a kingdom's worth.   OXFORD. Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,     Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,     And not betray thy treason with a blush?   WARWICK. Can Oxford that did ever fence the right     Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?     For shame! Leave Henry, and call Edward king.   OXFORD. Call him my king by whose injurious doom     My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,     Was done to death; and more than so, my father,     Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,     When nature brought him to the door of death?     No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,     This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.   WARWICK. And I the house of York.   LEWIS. Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,     Vouchsafe at our request to stand aside     While I use further conference with Warwick.                                               [They stand aloof]   QUEEN MARGARET. Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!   LEWIS. Now, Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,     Is Edward your true king? for I were loath     To link with him that were not lawful chosen.   WARWICK. Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.   LEWIS. But is he gracious in the people's eye?   WARWICK. The more that Henry was unfortunate.   LEWIS. Then further: all dissembling set aside,     Tell me for truth the measure of his love     Unto our sister Bona.   WARWICK. Such it seems     As may beseem a monarch like himself.     Myself have often heard him say and swear     That this his love was an eternal plant     Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,     The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,     Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,     Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.   LEWIS. Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.   BONA. Your grant or your denial shall be mine.     [To WARWICK] Yet I confess that often ere this day,     When I have heard your king's desert recounted,     Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.   LEWIS. Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's.     And now forthwith shall articles be drawn     Touching the jointure that your king must make,     Which with her dowry shall be counterpois'd.     Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness     That Bona shall be wife to the English king.   PRINCE OF WALES. To Edward, but not to the English king.   QUEEN MARGARET. Deceitful Warwick, it was thy device     By this alliance to make void my suit.     Before thy coming, Lewis was Henry's friend.   LEWIS. And still is friend to him and Margaret.     But if your title to the crown be weak,     As may appear by Edward's good success,     Then 'tis but reason that I be releas'd     From giving aid which late I promised.     Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand     That your estate requires and mine can yield.   WARWICK. Henry now lives in Scotland at his case,     Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.     And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,     You have a father able to maintain you,     And better 'twere you troubled him than France.   QUEEN MARGARET. Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick,     Proud setter up and puller down of kings!     I will not hence till with my talk and tears,     Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold     Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love;     For both of you are birds of self-same feather.                                     [POST blowing a horn within]   LEWIS. Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.                        Enter the POST   POST. My lord ambassador, these letters are for you,     Sent from your brother, Marquis Montague.     These from our King unto your Majesty.     And, madam, these for you; from whom I know not.                                    [They all read their letters]   OXFORD. I like it well that our fair Queen and mistress     Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his.   PRINCE OF WALES. Nay, mark how Lewis stamps as he were nettled.     I hope all's for the best.   LEWIS. Warwick, what are thy news? And yours, fair Queen?   QUEEN MARGARET. Mine such as fill my heart with unhop'd joys.   WARWICK. Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.   LEWIS. What, has your king married the Lady Grey?     And now, to soothe your forgery and his,     Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?     Is this th' alliance that he seeks with France?     Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?   QUEEN MARGARET. I told your Majesty as much before.     This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty.   WARWICK. King Lewis, I here protest in sight of heaven,     And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,     That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's-     No more my king, for he dishonours me,     But most himself, if he could see his shame.     Did I forget that by the house of York     My father came untimely to his death?     Did I let pass th' abuse done to my niece?     Did I impale him with the regal crown?     Did I put Henry from his native right?     And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?     Shame on himself! for my desert is honour;     And to repair my honour lost for him     I here renounce him and return to Henry.     My noble Queen, let former grudges pass,     And henceforth I am thy true servitor.     I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,     And replant Henry in his former state.   QUEEN MARGARET. Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;     And I forgive and quite forget old faults,     And joy that thou becom'st King Henry's friend.   WARWICK. So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,     That if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us     With some few bands of chosen soldiers,     I'll undertake to land them on our coast     And force the tyrant from his seat by war.     'Tis not his new-made bride shall succour him;     And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,     He's very likely now to fall from him     For matching more for wanton lust than honour     Or than for strength and safety of our country.   BONA. Dear brother, how shall Bona be reveng'd     But by thy help to this distressed queen?   QUEEN MARGARET. Renowned Prince, how shall poor Henry live     Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?   BONA. My quarrel and this English queen's are one.   WARWICK. And mine, fair Lady Bona, joins with yours.   LEWIS. And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's.     Therefore, at last, I firmly am resolv'd     You shall have aid.   QUEEN MARGARET. Let me give humble thanks for all at once.   LEWIS. Then, England's messenger, return in post     And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,     That Lewis of France is sending over masquers     To revel it with him and his new bride.     Thou seest what's past; go fear thy king withal.   BONA. Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,     I'll wear the willow-garland for his sake.   QUEEN MARGARET. Tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside,     And I am ready to put armour on.   WARWICK. Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,     And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.     There's thy reward; be gone.                       Exit POST   LEWIS. But, Warwick,     Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,     Shall cross the seas and bid false Edward battle:     And, as occasion serves, this noble Queen     And Prince shall follow with a fresh supply.     Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt:     What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?   WARWICK. This shall assure my constant loyalty:     That if our Queen and this young Prince agree,     I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy     To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.   QUEEN MARGARET. Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.     Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,     Therefore delay not- give thy hand to Warwick;     And with thy hand thy faith irrevocable     That only Warwick's daughter shall be thine.   PRINCE OF WALES. Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it;     And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand.                                   [He gives his hand to WARWICK]   LEWIS. stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied;     And thou, Lord Bourbon, our High Admiral,     Shall waft them over with our royal fleet.     I long till Edward fall by war's mischance     For mocking marriage with a dame of France.                                           Exeunt all but WARWICK   WARWICK. I came from Edward as ambassador,     But I return his sworn and mortal foe.     Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,     But dreadful war shall answer his demand.     Had he none else to make a stale but me?     Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.     I was the chief that rais'd him to the crown,     And I'll be chief to bring him down again;     Not that I pity Henry's misery,     But seek revenge on Edward's mockery.                   Exit ACT IV. SCENE I. London. The palace Enter GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, SOMERSET, and MONTAGUE   GLOUCESTER. Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you     Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey?     Hath not our brother made a worthy choice?   CLARENCE. Alas, you know 'tis far from hence to France!     How could he stay till Warwick made return?   SOMERSET. My lords, forbear this talk; here comes the King.            Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD, attended; LADY           GREY, as Queen; PEMBROKE, STAFFORD, HASTINGS,       and others. Four stand on one side, and four on the other   GLOUCESTER. And his well-chosen bride.   CLARENCE. I mind to tell him plainly what I think.   KING EDWARD. Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice     That you stand pensive as half malcontent?   CLARENCE. As well as Lewis of France or the Earl of Warwick,     Which are so weak of courage and in judgment     That they'll take no offence at our abuse.   KING EDWARD. Suppose they take offence without a cause;     They are but Lewis and Warwick: I am Edward,     Your King and Warwick's and must have my will.   GLOUCESTER. And shall have your will, because our King.     Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.   KING EDWARD. Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?   GLOUCESTER. Not I.     No, God forbid that I should wish them sever'd     Whom God hath join'd together; ay, and 'twere pity     To sunder them that yoke so well together.   KING EDWARD. Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,     Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey     Should not become my wife and England's Queen.     And you too, Somerset and Montague,     Speak freely what you think.   CLARENCE. Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis     Becomes your enemy for mocking him     About the marriage of the Lady Bona.   GLOUCESTER. And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,     Is now dishonoured by this new marriage.   KING EDWARD. What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeas'd     By such invention as I can devise?   MONTAGUE. Yet to have join'd with France in such alliance     Would more have strength'ned this our commonwealth     'Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage.   HASTINGS. Why, knows not Montague that of itself     England is safe, if true within itself?   MONTAGUE. But the safer when 'tis back'd with France.   HASTINGS. 'Tis better using France than trusting France.     Let us be back'd with God, and with the seas     Which He hath giv'n for fence impregnable,     And with their helps only defend ourselves.     In them and in ourselves our safety lies.   CLARENCE. For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves     To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford.   KING EDWARD. Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;     And for this once my will shall stand for law.   GLOUCESTER. And yet methinks your Grace hath not done well     To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales     Unto the brother of your loving bride.     She better would have fitted me or Clarence;     But in your bride you bury brotherhood.   CLARENCE. Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir     Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son,     And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere.   KING EDWARD. Alas, poor Clarence! Is it for a wife     That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee.   CLARENCE. In choosing for yourself you show'd your judgment,     Which being shallow, you shall give me leave     To play the broker in mine own behalf;     And to that end I shortly mind to leave you.   KING EDWARD. Leave me or tarry, Edward will be King,     And not be tied unto his brother's will.   QUEEN ELIZABETH. My lords, before it pleas'd his Majesty     To raise my state to title of a queen,     Do me but right, and you must all confess     That I was not ignoble of descent:     And meaner than myself have had like fortune.     But as this title honours me and mine,     So your dislikes, to whom I would be pleasing,     Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow.   KING EDWARD. My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns.     What danger or what sorrow can befall thee,     So long as Edward is thy constant friend     And their true sovereign whom they must obey?     Nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too,     Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;     Which if they do, yet will I keep thee safe,     And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath.   GLOUCESTER. [Aside] I hear, yet say not much, but think the more.                           Enter a POST   KING EDWARD. Now, messenger, what letters or what news     From France?   MESSENGER. My sovereign liege, no letters, and few words,     But such as I, without your special pardon,     Dare not relate.   KING EDWARD. Go to, we pardon thee; therefore, in brief,     Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them.     What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters?   MESSENGER. At my depart, these were his very words:     'Go tell false Edward, the supposed king,     That Lewis of France is sending over masquers     To revel it with him and his new bride.'   KING EDWARD. IS Lewis so brave? Belike he thinks me Henry.     But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?   MESSENGER. These were her words, utt'red with mild disdain:     'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,     I'll wear the willow-garland for his sake.'   KING EDWARD. I blame not her: she could say little less;     She had the wrong. But what said Henry's queen?     For I have heard that she was there in place.   MESSENGER. 'Tell him' quoth she 'my mourning weeds are done,     And I am ready to put armour on.'   KING EDWARD. Belike she minds to play the Amazon.     But what said Warwick to these injuries?   MESSENGER. He, more incens'd against your Majesty     Than all the rest, discharg'd me with these words:     'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong;     And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.'   KING EDWARD. Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?     Well, I will arm me, being thus forewarn'd.     They shall have wars and pay for their presumption.     But say, is Warwick friends with Margaret?   MESSENGER. Ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in friendship     That young Prince Edward marries Warwick's daughter.   CLARENCE. Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger.     Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,     For I will hence to Warwick's other daughter;     That, though I want a kingdom, yet in marriage     I may not prove inferior to yourself.     You that love me and Warwick, follow me.                                       Exit, and SOMERSET follows   GLOUCESTER. [Aside] Not I.     My thoughts aim at a further matter; I     Stay not for the love of Edward but the crown.   KING EDWARD. Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick!     Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen;     And haste is needful in this desp'rate case.     Pembroke and Stafford, you in our behalf     Go levy men and make prepare for war;     They are already, or quickly will be landed.     Myself in person will straight follow you.                                     Exeunt PEMBROKE and STAFFORD     But ere I go, Hastings and Montague,     Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,     Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance.     Tell me if you love Warwick more than me?     If it be so, then both depart to him:     I rather wish you foes than hollow friends.     But if you mind to hold your true obedience,     Give me assurance with some friendly vow,     That I may never have you in suspect.   MONTAGUE. So God help Montague as he proves true!   HASTINGS. And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!   KING EDWARD. Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?   GLOUCESTER. Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you.   KING EDWARD. Why, so! then am I sure of victory.     Now therefore let us hence, and lose no hour     Till we meet Warwick with his foreign pow'r.          Exeunt SCENE II. A plain in Warwickshire Enter WARWICK and OXFORD, with French soldiers   WARWICK. Trust me, my lord, all hitherto goes well;     The common people by numbers swarm to us.                  Enter CLARENCE and SOMERSET     But see where Somerset and Clarence comes.     Speak suddenly, my lords- are we all friends?   CLARENCE. Fear not that, my lord.   WARWICK. Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick;     And welcome, Somerset. I hold it cowardice     To rest mistrustful where a noble heart     Hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love;     Else might I think that Clarence, Edward's brother,     Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings.     But welcome, sweet Clarence; my daughter shall be thine.     And now what rests but, in night's coverture,     Thy brother being carelessly encamp'd,     His soldiers lurking in the towns about,     And but attended by a simple guard,     We may surprise and take him at our pleasure?     Our scouts have found the adventure very easy;     That as Ulysses and stout Diomede     With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents,     And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds,     So we, well cover'd with the night's black mantle,     At unawares may beat down Edward's guard     And seize himself- I say not 'slaughter him,'     For I intend but only to surprise him.     You that will follow me to this attempt,     Applaud the name of Henry with your leader.                                          [They all cry 'Henry!']     Why then, let's on our way in silent sort.     For Warwick and his friends, God and Saint George!    Exeunt SCENE III. Edward's camp, near Warwick Enter three WATCHMEN, to guard the KING'S tent   FIRST WATCHMAN. Come on, my masters, each man take his stand;     The King by this is set him down to sleep.   SECOND WATCHMAN. What, will he not to bed?   FIRST WATCHMAN. Why, no; for he hath made a solemn vow     Never to lie and take his natural rest     Till Warwick or himself be quite suppress'd.   SECOND WATCHMAN. To-morrow then, belike, shall be the day,     If Warwick be so near as men report.   THIRD WATCHMAN. But say, I pray, what nobleman is that     That with the King here resteth in his tent?   FIRST WATCHMAN. 'Tis the Lord Hastings, the King's chiefest friend.   THIRD WATCHMAN. O, is it So? But why commands the King     That his chief followers lodge in towns about him,     While he himself keeps in the cold field?   SECOND WATCHMAN. 'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous.   THIRD WATCHMAN. Ay, but give me worship and quietness;     I like it better than dangerous honour.     If Warwick knew in what estate he stands,     'Tis to be doubted he would waken him.   FIRST WATCHMAN. Unless our halberds did shut up his passage.   SECOND WATCHMAN. Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent     But to defend his person from night-foes?              Enter WARWICK, CLARENCE, OXFORD, SOMERSET,                    and French soldiers, silent all   WARWICK. This is his tent; and see where stand his guard.     Courage, my masters! Honour now or never!     But follow me, and Edward shall be ours.   FIRST WATCHMAN. Who goes there?   SECOND WATCHMAN. Stay, or thou diest.        WARWICK and the rest cry all 'Warwick! Warwick!' and       set upon the guard, who fly, crying 'Arm! Arm!' WARWICK                    and the rest following them       The drum playing and trumpet sounding, re-enter WARWICK          and the rest, bringing the KING out in his gown,    sitting in a chair. GLOUCESTER and HASTINGS fly over the stage   SOMERSET. What are they that fly there?   WARWICK. Richard and Hastings. Let them go; here is the Duke.   KING EDWARD. The Duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted,     Thou call'dst me King?   WARWICK. Ay, but the case is alter'd.     When you disgrac'd me in my embassade,     Then I degraded you from being King,     And come now to create you Duke of York.     Alas, how should you govern any kingdom     That know not how to use ambassadors,     Nor how to be contented with one wife,     Nor how to use your brothers brotherly,     Nor how to study for the people's welfare,     Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies?   KING EDWARD. Yea, brother of Clarence, art thou here too?     Nay, then I see that Edward needs must down.     Yet, Warwick, in despite of all mischance,     Of thee thyself and all thy complices,     Edward will always bear himself as King.     Though fortune's malice overthrow my state,     My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel.   WARWICK. Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king;                                            [Takes off his crown]     But Henry now shall wear the English crown     And be true King indeed; thou but the shadow.     My Lord of Somerset, at my request,     See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd     Unto my brother, Archbishop of York.     When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows,     I'll follow you and tell what answer     Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him.     Now for a while farewell, good Duke of York.   KING EDWARD. What fates impose, that men must needs abide;     It boots not to resist both wind and tide.                                     [They lead him out forcibly]   OXFORD. What now remains, my lords, for us to do     But march to London with our soldiers?   WARWICK. Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do;     To free King Henry from imprisonment,     And see him seated in the regal throne.               Exeunt SCENE IV. London. The palace Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and RIVERS   RIVERS. Madam, what makes you in this sudden change?   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Why, brother Rivers, are you yet to learn     What late misfortune is befall'n King Edward?   RIVERS. What, loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?   QUEEN ELIZABETH. No, but the loss of his own royal person.   RIVERS. Then is my sovereign slain?   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner;     Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard     Or by his foe surpris'd at unawares;     And, as I further have to understand,     Is new committed to the Bishop of York,     Fell Warwick's brother, and by that our foe.   RIVERS. These news, I must confess, are full of grief;     Yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may:     Warwick may lose that now hath won the day.   QUEEN ELIZABETH. Till then, fair hope must hinder life's decay.     And I the rather wean me from despair     For love of Edward's offspring in my womb.     This is it that makes me bridle passion     And bear with mildness my misfortune's cross;     Ay, ay, for this I draw in many a tear     And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs,     Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown     King Edward's fruit, true heir to th' English crown.   RIVERS. But, madam, where is Warwick then become?   QUEEN ELIZABETH. I am inform'd that he comes towards London     To set the crown once more on Henry's head.     Guess thou the rest: King Edward's friends must down.     But to prevent the tyrant's violence-     For trust not him that hath once broken faith-     I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary     To save at least the heir of Edward's right.     There shall I rest secure from force and fraud.     Come, therefore, let us fly while we may fly:     If Warwick take us, we are sure to die.               Exeunt SCENE V. A park near Middleham Castle in Yorkshire Enter GLOUCESTER, LORD HASTINGS, SIR WILLIAM STANLEY, and others   GLOUCESTER. Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley,     Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither     Into this chiefest thicket of the park.     Thus stands the case: you know our King, my brother,     Is prisoner to the Bishop here, at whose hands     He hath good usage and great liberty;     And often but attended with weak guard     Comes hunting this way to disport himself.     I have advertis'd him by secret means     That if about this hour he make this way,     Under the colour of his usual game,     He shall here find his friends, with horse and men,     To set him free from his captivity.              Enter KING EDWARD and a HUNTSMAN with him   HUNTSMAN. This way, my lord; for this way lies the game.   KING EDWARD. Nay, this way, man. See where the huntsmen stand.     Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and the rest,     Stand you thus close to steal the Bishop's deer?   GLOUCESTER. Brother, the time and case requireth haste;     Your horse stands ready at the park corner.   KING EDWARD. But whither shall we then?   HASTINGS. To Lynn, my lord; and shipt from thence to Flanders.   GLOUCESTER. Well guess'd, believe me; for that was my meaning.   KING EDWARD. Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness.   GLOUCESTER. But wherefore stay we? 'Tis no time to talk.   KING EDWARD. Huntsman, what say'st thou? Wilt thou go along?   HUNTSMAN. Better do so than tarry and be hang'd.   GLOUCESTER. Come then, away; let's ha' no more ado.   KING EDWARD. Bishop, farewell. Shield thee from Warwick's frown,     And pray that I may repossess the crown.              Exeunt SCENE VI. London. The Tower Flourish. Enter KING HENRY, CLARENCE, WARWICK, SOMERSET, young HENRY, EARL OF RICHMOND, OXFORD, MONTAGUE, LIEUTENANT OF THE TOWER, and attendants   KING HENRY. Master Lieutenant, now that God and friends     Have shaken Edward from the regal seat     And turn'd my captive state to liberty,     My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys,     At our enlargement what are thy due fees?   LIEUTENANT. Subjects may challenge nothing of their sov'reigns;     But if an humble prayer may prevail,     I then crave pardon of your Majesty.   KING HENRY. For what, Lieutenant? For well using me?     Nay, be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness,     For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure;     Ay, such a pleasure as incaged birds     Conceive when, after many moody thoughts,     At last by notes of household harmony     They quite forget their loss of liberty.     But, Warwick, after God, thou set'st me free,     And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee;     He was the author, thou the instrument.     Therefore, that I may conquer fortune's spite     By living low where fortune cannot hurt me,     And that the people of this blessed land     May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars,     Warwick, although my head still wear the crown,     I here resign my government to thee,     For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.   WARWICK. Your Grace hath still been fam'd for virtuous,     And now may seem as wise as virtuous     By spying and avoiding fortune's malice,     For few men rightly temper with the stars;     Yet in this one thing let me blame your Grace,     For choosing me when Clarence is in place.   CLARENCE. No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,     To whom the heav'ns in thy nativity     Adjudg'd an olive branch and laurel crown,     As likely to be blest in peace and war;     And therefore I yield thee my free consent.   WARWICK. And I choose Clarence only for Protector.   KING HENRY. Warwick and Clarence, give me both your hands.     Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,     That no dissension hinder government.     I make you both Protectors of this land,     While I myself will lead a private life     And in devotion spend my latter days,     To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise.   WARWICK. What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?   CLARENCE. That he consents, if Warwick yield consent,     For on thy fortune I repose myself.   WARWICK. Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content.     We'll yoke together, like a double shadow     To Henry's body, and supply his place;     I mean, in bearing weight of government,     While he enjoys the honour and his ease.     And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful     Forthwith that Edward be pronounc'd a traitor,     And all his lands and goods confiscated.   CLARENCE. What else? And that succession be determin'd.   WARWICK. Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part.   KING HENRY. But, with the first of all your chief affairs,     Let me entreat- for I command no more-     That Margaret your Queen and my son Edward     Be sent for to return from France with speed;     For till I see them here, by doubtful fear     My joy of liberty is half eclips'd.   CLARENCE. It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed.   KING HENRY. My Lord of Somerset, what youth is that,     Of whom you seem to have so tender care?   SOMERSET. My liege, it is young Henry, Earl of Richmond.   KING HENRY. Come hither, England's hope.                                      [Lays his hand on his head]     If secret powers     Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts,     This pretty lad will prove our country's bliss.     His looks are full of peaceful majesty;     His head by nature fram'd to wear a crown,     His hand to wield a sceptre; and himself     Likely in time to bless a regal throne.     Make much of him, my lords; for this is he     Must help you more than you are hurt by me.                           Enter a POST   WARWICK. What news, my friend?   POST. That Edward is escaped from your brother     And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy.   WARWICK. Unsavoury news! But how made he escape?   POST. He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester     And the Lord Hastings, who attended him     In secret ambush on the forest side     And from the Bishop's huntsmen rescu'd him;     For hunting was his daily exercise.   WARWICK. My brother was too careless of his charge.     But let us hence, my sovereign, to provide     A salve for any sore that may betide.                    Exeunt all but SOMERSET, RICHMOND, and OXFORD   SOMERSET. My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward's;     For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help,     And we shall have more wars befor't be long.     As Henry's late presaging prophecy     Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond,     So doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts,     What may befall him to his harm and ours.     Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst,     Forthwith we'll send him hence to Brittany,     Till storms be past of civil enmity.   OXFORD. Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown,     'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down.   SOMERSET. It shall be so; he shall to Brittany.     Come therefore, let's about it speedily.              Exeunt SCENE VII. Before York Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD, GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and soldiers   KING EDWARD. Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest,     Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends,     And says that once more I shall interchange     My waned state for Henry's regal crown.     Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas,     And brought desired help from Burgundy;     What then remains, we being thus arriv'd     From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York,     But that we enter, as into our dukedom?   GLOUCESTER. The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this;     For many men that stumble at the threshold     Are well foretold that danger lurks within.   KING EDWARD. Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us.     By fair or foul means we must enter in,     For hither will our friends repair to us.   HASTINGS. My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them.          Enter, on the walls, the MAYOR OF YORK and                        his BRETHREN   MAYOR. My lords, we were forewarned of your coming     And shut the gates for safety of ourselves,     For now we owe allegiance unto Henry.   KING EDWARD. But, Master Mayor, if Henry be your King,     Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York.   MAYOR. True, my good lord; I know you for no less.   KING EDWARD. Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom,     As being well content with that alone.   GLOUCESTER. [Aside] But when the fox hath once got in his nose,     He'll soon find means to make the body follow.   HASTINGS. Why, Master Mayor, why stand you in a doubt?     Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.   MAYOR. Ay, say you so? The gates shall then be open'd.                                                    [He descends]   GLOUCESTER. A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!   HASTINGS. The good old man would fain that all were well,     So 'twere not long of him; but being ent'red,     I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuade     Both him and all his brothers unto reason.              Enter, below, the MAYOR and two ALDERMEN   KING EDWARD. So, Master Mayor. These gates must not be shut     But in the night or in the time of war.     What! fear not, man, but yield me up the keys;                                                 [Takes his keys]     For Edward will defend the town and thee,     And all those friends that deign to follow me.            March. Enter MONTGOMERY with drum and soldiers   GLOUCESTER. Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery,     Our trusty friend, unless I be deceiv'd.   KING EDWARD. Welcome, Sir john! But why come you in arms?   MONTGOMERY. To help King Edward in his time of storm,     As every loyal subject ought to do.   KING EDWARD. Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget     Our title to the crown, and only claim     Our dukedom till God please to send the rest.   MONTGOMERY. Then fare you well, for I will hence again.     I came to serve a king and not a duke.     Drummer, strike up, and let us march away.                                       [The drum begins to march]   KING EDWARD. Nay, stay, Sir John, a while, and we'll debate     By what safe means the crown may be recover'd.   MONTGOMERY. What talk you of debating? In few words:     If you'll not here proclaim yourself our King,     I'll leave you to your fortune and be gone     To keep them back that come to succour you.     Why shall we fight, if you pretend no title?   GLOUCESTER. Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?   KING EDWARD. When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim;     Till then 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning.   HASTINGS. Away with scrupulous wit! Now arms must rule.   GLOUCESTER. And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.     Brother, we will proclaim you out of hand;     The bruit thereof will bring you many friends.   KING EDWARD. Then be it as you will; for 'tis my right,     And Henry but usurps the diadem.   MONTGOMERY. Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself;     And now will I be Edward's champion.   HASTINGS. Sound trumpet; Edward shall be here proclaim'd.     Come, fellow soldier, make thou proclamation.                                    [Gives him a paper. Flourish]   SOLDIER. [Reads] 'Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God,     King of England and France, and Lord of Ireland, &c.'   MONTGOMERY. And whoso'er gainsays King Edward's right,     By this I challenge him to single fight.                                           [Throws down gauntlet]   ALL. Long live Edward the Fourth!   KING EDWARD. Thanks, brave Montgomery, and thanks unto you all;     If fortune serve me, I'll requite this kindness.     Now for this night let's harbour here in York;     And when the morning sun shall raise his car     Above the border of this horizon,     We'll forward towards Warwick and his mates;     For well I wot that Henry is no soldier.     Ah, froward Clarence, how evil it beseems the     To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother!     Yet, as we may, we'll meet both thee and Warwick.     Come on, brave soldiers; doubt not of the day,     And, that once gotten, doubt not of large pay.        Exeunt SCENE VIII. London. The palace Flourish. Enter KING HENRY, WARWICK, MONTAGUE, CLARENCE, OXFORD, and EXETER   WARWICK. What counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia,     With hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders,     Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas     And with his troops doth march amain to London;     And many giddy people flock to him.   KING HENRY. Let's levy men and beat him back again.   CLARENCE. A little fire is quickly trodden out,     Which, being suffer'd, rivers cannot quench.   WARWICK. In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends,     Not mutinous in peace, yet bold in war;     Those will I muster up, and thou, son Clarence,     Shalt stir up in Suffolk, Norfolk, and in Kent,     The knights and gentlemen to come with thee.     Thou, brother Montague, in Buckingham,     Northampton, and in Leicestershire, shalt find     Men well inclin'd to hear what thou command'st.     And thou, brave Oxford, wondrous well belov'd,     In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends.     My sovereign, with the loving citizens,     Like to his island girt in with the ocean     Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs,     Shall rest in London till we come to him.     Fair lords, take leave and stand not to reply.     Farewell, my sovereign.   KING HENRY. Farewell, my Hector and my Troy's true hope.   CLARENCE. In sign of truth, I kiss your Highness' hand.   KING HENRY. Well-minded Clarence, be thou fortunate!   MONTAGUE. Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave.   OXFORD. [Kissing the KING'S band] And thus I seal my truth and bid     adieu.   KING HENRY. Sweet Oxford, and my loving Montague,     And all at once, once more a happy farewell.   WARWICK. Farewell, sweet lords; let's meet at Coventry.                               Exeunt all but the KING and EXETER   KING HENRY. Here at the palace will I rest a while.     Cousin of Exeter, what thinks your lordship?     Methinks the power that Edward hath in field     Should not be able to encounter mine.   EXETER. The doubt is that he will seduce the rest.   KING HENRY. That's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame:     I have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands,     Nor posted off their suits with slow delays;     My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds,     My mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs,     My mercy dried their water-flowing tears;     I have not been desirous of their wealth,     Nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies,     Nor forward of revenge, though they much err'd.     Then why should they love Edward more than me?     No, Exeter, these graces challenge grace;     And, when the lion fawns upon the lamb,     The lamb will never cease to follow him.                       [Shout within 'A Lancaster! A Lancaster!']   EXETER. Hark, hark, my lord! What shouts are these?             Enter KING EDWARD, GLOUCESTER, and soldiers   KING EDWARD. Seize on the shame-fac'd Henry, bear him hence;     And once again proclaim us King of England.     You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow.     Now stops thy spring; my sea shall suck them dry,     And swell so much the higher by their ebb.     Hence with him to the Tower: let him not speak.                                      Exeunt some with KING HENRY     And, lords, towards Coventry bend we our course,     Where peremptory Warwick now remains.     The sun shines hot; and, if we use delay,     Cold biting winter mars our hop'd-for hay.   GLOUCESTER. Away betimes, before his forces join,     And take the great-grown traitor unawares.     Brave warriors, march amain towards Coventry.         Exeunt ACT V. SCENE I. Coventry Enter WARWICK, the MAYOR OF COVENTRY, two MESSENGERS, and others upon the walls   WARWICK. Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford?     How far hence is thy lord, mine honest fellow?   FIRST MESSENGER. By this at Dunsmore, marching hitherward.   WARWICK. How far off is our brother Montague?     Where is the post that came from Montague?   SECOND MESSENGER. By this at Daintry, with a puissant troop.                    Enter SIR JOHN SOMERVILLE   WARWICK. Say, Somerville, what says my loving son?     And by thy guess how nigh is Clarence now?   SOMERVILLE. At Southam I did leave him with his forces,     And do expect him here some two hours hence.                                                     [Drum heard]   WARWICK. Then Clarence is at hand; I hear his drum.   SOMERVILLE. It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies.     The drum your Honour hears marcheth from Warwick.   WARWICK. Who should that be? Belike unlook'd for friends.   SOMERVILLE. They are at hand, and you shall quickly know.         March. Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD, GLOUCESTER,                          and soldiers   KING EDWARD. Go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle.   GLOUCESTER. See how the surly Warwick mans the wall.   WARWICK. O unbid spite! Is sportful Edward come?     Where slept our scouts or how are they seduc'd     That we could hear no news of his repair?   KING EDWARD. Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,     Speak gentle words, and humbly bend thy knee,     Call Edward King, and at his hands beg mercy?     And he shall pardon thee these outrages.   WARWICK. Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,     Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee down,     Call Warwick patron, and be penitent?     And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York.   GLOUCESTER. I thought, at least, he would have said the King;     Or did he make the jest against his will?   WARWICK. Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?   GLOUCESTER. Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give.     I'll do thee service for so good a gift.   WARWICK. 'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother.   KING EDWARD. Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift.   WARWICK. Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight;     And, weakling, Warwick takes his gift again;     And Henry is my King, Warwick his subject.   KING EDWARD. But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner.     And, gallant Warwick, do but answer this:     What is the body when the head is off?   GLOUCESTER. Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast,     But, whiles he thought to steal the single ten,     The king was slily finger'd from the deck!     You left poor Henry at the Bishop's palace,     And ten to one you'll meet him in the Tower.   KING EDWARD. 'Tis even so; yet you are Warwick still.   GLOUCESTER. Come, Warwick, take the time; kneel down, kneel down.     Nay, when? Strike now, or else the iron cools.   WARWICK. I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,     And with the other fling it at thy face,     Than bear so low a sail to strike to thee.   KING EDWARD. Sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend,     This hand, fast wound about thy coal-black hair,     Shall, whiles thy head is warm and new cut off,     Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood:     'Wind-changing Warwick now can change no more.'                Enter OXFORD, with drum and colours   WARWICK. O cheerful colours! See where Oxford comes.   OXFORD. Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster!                               [He and his forces enter the city]   GLOUCESTER. The gates are open, let us enter too.   KING EDWARD. So other foes may set upon our backs.     Stand we in good array, for they no doubt     Will issue out again and bid us battle;     If not, the city being but of small defence,     We'll quietly rouse the traitors in the same.   WARWICK. O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help.              Enter MONTAGUE, with drum and colours   MONTAGUE. Montague, Montague, for Lancaster!                               [He and his forces enter the city]   GLOUCESTER. Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason     Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear.   KING EDWARD. The harder match'd, the greater victory.     My mind presageth happy gain and conquest.              Enter SOMERSET, with drum and colours   SOMERSET. Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster!                               [He and his forces enter the city]   GLOUCESTER. Two of thy name, both Dukes of Somerset,     Have sold their lives unto the house of York;     And thou shalt be the third, if this sword hold.              Enter CLARENCE, with drum and colours   WARWICK. And lo where George of Clarence sweeps along,     Of force enough to bid his brother battle;     With whom an upright zeal to right prevails     More than the nature of a brother's love.   CLARENCE. Clarence, Clarence, for Lancaster!   KING EDWARD. Et tu Brute- wilt thou stab Caesar too?     A parley, sirrah, to George of Clarence.                   [Sound a parley. RICHARD and CLARENCE whisper]   WARWICK. Come, Clarence, come. Thou wilt if Warwick call.   CLARENCE. [Taking the red rose from his hat and throwing       it at WARWICK]     Father of Warwick, know you what this means?     Look here, I throw my infamy at thee.     I will not ruinate my father's house,     Who gave his blood to lime the stones together,     And set up Lancaster. Why, trowest thou, Warwick,     That Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural,     To bend the fatal instruments of war     Against his brother and his lawful King?     Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath.     To keep that oath were more impiety     Than Jephtha when he sacrific'd his daughter.     I am so sorry for my trespass made     That, to deserve well at my brother's hands,     I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe;     With resolution whereso'er I meet thee-     As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad-     To plague thee for thy foul misleading me.     And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I defy thee,     And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks.     Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends;     And, Richard, do not frown upon my faults,     For I will henceforth be no more unconstant.   KING EDWARD. Now welcome more, and ten times more belov'd,     Than if thou never hadst deserv'd our hate.   GLOUCESTER. Welcome, good Clarence; this is brother-like.   WARWICK. O passing traitor, perjur'd and unjust!   KING EDWARD. What, Warwick, wilt thou leave die town and fight?     Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears?   WARWICK. Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence!     I will away towards Barnet presently     And bid thee battle, Edward, if thou dar'st.   KING EDWARD. Yes, Warwick, Edward dares and leads the way.     Lords, to the field; Saint George and victory!                                                  Exeunt YORKISTS                          [March. WARWICK and his company follow] SCENE II. A field of battle near Barnet Alarum and excursions. Enter KING EDWARD, bringing forth WARWICK, wounded   KING EDWARD. So, lie thou there. Die thou, and die our fear;     For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all.     Now, Montague, sit fast; I seek for thee,     That Warwick's bones may keep thine company.            Exit   WARWICK. Ah, who is nigh? Come to me, friend or foe,     And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?     Why ask I that? My mangled body shows,     My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows,     That I must yield my body to the earth     And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.     Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,     Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,     Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,     Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree     And kept low shrubs from winter's pow'rful wind.     These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,     Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun     To search the secret treasons of the world;     The wrinkles in my brows, now fill'd with blood,     Were lik'ned oft to kingly sepulchres;     For who liv'd King, but I could dig his grave?     And who durst smile when Warwick bent his brow?     Lo now my glory smear'd in dust and blood!     My parks, my walks, my manors, that I had,     Even now forsake me; and of all my lands     Is nothing left me but my body's length.     what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?     And live we how we can, yet die we must.                   Enter OXFORD and SOMERSET   SOMERSET. Ah, Warwick, Warwick! wert thou as we are,     We might recover all our loss again.     The Queen from France hath brought a puissant power;     Even now we heard the news. Ah, couldst thou fly!   WARWICK. Why then, I would not fly. Ah, Montague,     If thou be there, sweet brother, take my hand,     And with thy lips keep in my soul a while!     Thou lov'st me not; for, brother, if thou didst,     Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood     That glues my lips and will not let me speak.     Come quickly, Montague, or I am dead.   SOMERSET. Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breath'd his last;     And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick,     And said 'Commend me to my valiant brother.'     And more he would have said; and more he spoke,     Which sounded like a clamour in a vault,     That mought not be distinguish'd; but at last,     I well might hear, delivered with a groan,     'O farewell, Warwick!'   WARWICK. Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves:     For Warwick bids you all farewell, to meet in heaven.                                                           [Dies]   OXFORD. Away, away, to meet the Queen's great power!                                   [Here they bear away his body] SCENE III. Another part of the field Flourish. Enter KING in triumph; with GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and the rest   KING EDWARD. Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course,     And we are grac'd with wreaths of victory.     But in the midst of this bright-shining day     I spy a black, suspicious, threat'ning cloud     That will encounter with our glorious sun     Ere he attain his easeful western bed-     I mean, my lords, those powers that the Queen     Hath rais'd in Gallia have arriv'd our coast     And, as we hear, march on to fight with us.   CLARENCE. A little gale will soon disperse that cloud     And blow it to the source from whence it came;     Thy very beams will dry those vapours up,     For every cloud engenders not a storm.   GLOUCESTER. The Queen is valued thirty thousand strong,     And Somerset, with Oxford, fled to her.     If she have time to breathe, be well assur'd     Her faction will be full as strong as ours.   KING EDWARD. are advertis'd by our loving friends     That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury;     We, having now the best at Barnet field,     Will thither straight, for willingness rids way;     And as we march our strength will be augmented     In every county as we go along.     Strike up the drum; cry 'Courage!' and away.          Exeunt SCENE IV. Plains wear Tewksbury Flourish. March. Enter QUEEN MARGARET, PRINCE EDWARD, SOMERSET, OXFORD, and SOLDIERS   QUEEN MARGARET. Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their       loss,     But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.     What though the mast be now blown overboard,     The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost,     And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood;     Yet lives our pilot still. Is't meet that he     Should leave the helm and, like a fearful lad,     With tearful eyes add water to the sea     And give more strength to that which hath too much;     Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock,     Which industry and courage might have sav'd?     Ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this!     Say Warwick was our anchor; what of that?     And Montague our top-mast; what of him?     Our slaught'red friends the tackles; what of these?     Why, is not Oxford here another anchor?     And Somerset another goodly mast?     The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings?     And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I     For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge?     We will not from the helm to sit and weep,     But keep our course, though the rough wind say no,     From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck,     As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.     And what is Edward but a ruthless sea?     What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?     And Richard but a ragged fatal rock?     All these the enemies to our poor bark.     Say you can swim; alas, 'tis but a while!     Tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink.     Bestride the rock; the tide will wash you off,     Or else you famish- that's a threefold death.     This speak I, lords, to let you understand,     If case some one of you would fly from us,     That there's no hop'd-for mercy with the brothers     More than with ruthless waves, with sands, and rocks.     Why, courage then! What cannot be avoided     'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear.   PRINCE OF WALES. Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit     Should, if a coward hear her speak these words,     Infuse his breast with magnanimity     And make him naked foil a man-at-arms.     I speak not this as doubting any here;     For did I but suspect a fearful man,     He should have leave to go away betimes,     Lest in our need he might infect another     And make him of the like spirit to himself.     If any such be here- as God forbid!-     Let him depart before we need his help.   OXFORD. Women and children of so high a courage,     And warriors faint! Why, 'twere perpetual shame.     O brave young Prince! thy famous grandfather     Doth live again in thee. Long mayst thou Eve     To bear his image and renew his glories!   SOMERSET. And he that will not fight for such a hope,     Go home to bed and, like the owl by day,     If he arise, be mock'd and wond'red at.   QUEEN MARGARET. Thanks, gentle Somerset; sweet Oxford, thanks.   PRINCE OF WALES. And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else.                         Enter a MESSENGER   MESSENGER. Prepare you, lords, for Edward is at hand     Ready to fight; therefore be resolute.   OXFORD. I thought no less. It is his policy     To haste thus fast, to find us unprovided.   SOMERSET. But he's deceiv'd; we are in readiness.   QUEEN MARGARET. This cheers my heart, to see your forwardness.   OXFORD. Here pitch our battle; hence we will not budge.       Flourish and march. Enter, at a distance, KING EDWARD,                GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and soldiers   KING EDWARD. Brave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood     Which, by the heavens' assistance and your strength,     Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night.     I need not add more fuel to your fire,     For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out.     Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords.   QUEEN MARGARET. Lords, knights, and gentlemen, what I should say     My tears gainsay; for every word I speak,     Ye see, I drink the water of my eye.     Therefore, no more but this: Henry, your sovereign,     Is prisoner to the foe; his state usurp'd,     His realm a slaughter-house, his subjects slain,     His statutes cancell'd, and his treasure spent;     And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil.     You fight in justice. Then, in God's name, lords,     Be valiant, and give signal to the fight.                              Alarum, retreat, excursions. Exeunt SCENE V. Another part of the field Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and forces, With QUEEN MARGARET, OXFORD, and SOMERSET, prisoners   KING EDWARD. Now here a period of tumultuous broils.     Away with Oxford to Hames Castle straight;     For Somerset, off with his guilty head.     Go, bear them hence; I will not hear them speak.   OXFORD. For my part, I'll not trouble thee with words.   SOMERSET. Nor I, but stoop with patience to my fortune.                              Exeunt OXFORD and SOMERSET, guarded   QUEEN MARGARET. So part we sadly in this troublous world,     To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem.   KING EDWARD. Is proclamation made that who finds Edward     Shall have a high reward, and he his life?   GLOUCESTER. It is; and lo where youthful Edward comes.                 Enter soldiers, with PRINCE EDWARD   KING EDWARD. Bring forth the gallant; let us hear him speak.     What, can so young a man begin to prick?     Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make     For bearing arms, for stirring up my subjects,     And all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to?   PRINCE OF WALES. Speak like a subject, proud ambitious York.     Suppose that I am now my father's mouth;     Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,     Whilst I propose the self-same words to the     Which, traitor, thou wouldst have me answer to.   QUEEN MARGARET. Ah, that thy father had been so resolv'd!   GLOUCESTER. That you might still have worn the petticoat     And ne'er have stol'n the breech from Lancaster.   PRINCE OF WALES. Let Aesop fable in a winter's night;     His currish riddle sorts not with this place.   GLOUCESTER. By heaven, brat, I'll plague ye for that word.   QUEEN MARGARET. Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men.   GLOUCESTER. For God's sake, take away this captive scold.   PRINCE OF WALES. Nay, take away this scolding crookback rather.   KING EDWARD. Peace, wilful boy, or I will charm your tongue.   CLARENCE. Untutor'd lad, thou art too malapert.   PRINCE OF WALES. I know my duty; you are all undutiful.     Lascivious Edward, and thou perjur'd George,     And thou misshapen Dick, I tell ye all     I am your better, traitors as ye are;     And thou usurp'st my father's right and mine.   KING EDWARD. Take that, the likeness of this railer here.                                                      [Stabs him]   GLOUCESTER. Sprawl'st thou? Take that, to end thy agony.                                                      [Stabs him]   CLARENCE. And there's for twitting me with perjury.                                                      [Stabs him]   QUEEN MARGARET. O, kill me too!   GLOUCESTER. Marry, and shall.             [Offers to kill her]   KING EDWARD. Hold, Richard, hold; for we have done to much.   GLOUCESTER. Why should she live to fill the world with words?   KING EDWARD. What, doth she swoon? Use means for her recovery.   GLOUCESTER. Clarence, excuse me to the King my brother.     I'll hence to London on a serious matter;     Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.   CLARENCE. What? what?   GLOUCESTER. The Tower! the Tower!                         Exit   QUEEN MARGARET. O Ned, sweet Ned, speak to thy mother, boy!     Canst thou not speak? O traitors! murderers!     They that stabb'd Caesar shed no blood at all,     Did not offend, nor were not worthy blame,     If this foul deed were by to equal it.     He was a man: this, in respect, a child;     And men ne'er spend their fury on a child.     What's worse than murderer, that I may name it?     No, no, my heart will burst, an if I speak-     And I will speak, that so my heart may burst.     Butchers and villains! bloody cannibals!     How sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd!     You have no children, butchers, if you had,     The thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse.     But if you ever chance to have a child,     Look in his youth to have him so cut off     As, deathsmen, you have rid this sweet young prince!   KING EDWARD. Away with her; go, bear her hence perforce.   QUEEN MARGARET. Nay, never bear me hence; dispatch me here.     Here sheathe thy sword; I'll pardon thee my death.     What, wilt thou not? Then, Clarence, do it thou.   CLARENCE. By heaven, I will not do thee so much ease.   QUEEN MARGARET. Good Clarence, do; sweet Clarence, do thou do it.   CLARENCE. Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it?   QUEEN MARGARET. Ay, but thou usest to forswear thyself.     'Twas sin before, but now 'tis charity.     What! wilt thou not? Where is that devil's butcher,     Hard-favour'd Richard? Richard, where art thou?     Thou art not here. Murder is thy alms-deed;     Petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back.   KING EDWARD. Away, I say; I charge ye bear her hence.   QUEEN MARGARET. So come to you and yours as to this prince.                                           Exit, led out forcibly   KING EDWARD. Where's Richard gone?   CLARENCE. To London, all in post; and, as I guess,     To make a bloody supper in the Tower.   KING EDWARD. He's sudden, if a thing comes in his head.     Now march we hence. Discharge the common sort     With pay and thanks; and let's away to London     And see our gentle queen how well she fares.     By this, I hope, she hath a son for me.               Exeunt SCENE VI. London. The Tower Enter KING HENRY and GLOUCESTER with the LIEUTENANT, on the walls   GLOUCESTER. Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?   KING HENRY. Ay, my good lord- my lord, I should say rather.     'Tis sin to flatter; 'good' was little better.     'Good Gloucester' and 'good devil' were alike,     And both preposterous; therefore, not 'good lord.'   GLOUCESTER. Sirrah, leave us to ourselves; we must confer.                                                  Exit LIEUTENANT   KING HENRY. So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf;     So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece,     And next his throat unto the butcher's knife.     What scene of death hath Roscius now to act?   GLOUCESTER. Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind:     The thief doth fear each bush an officer.   KING HENRY. The bird that hath been limed in a bush     With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush;     And I, the hapless male to one sweet bird,     Have now the fatal object in my eye     Where my poor young was lim'd, was caught, and kill'd.   GLOUCESTER. Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete     That taught his son the office of a fowl!     And yet, for all his wings, the fool was drown'd.   KING HENRY. I, Daedalus; my poor boy, Icarus;     Thy father, Minos, that denied our course;     The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy,     Thy brother Edward; and thyself, the sea     Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life.     Ah, kill me with thy weapon, not with words!     My breast can better brook thy dagger's point     Than can my ears that tragic history.     But wherefore dost thou come? Is't for my life?   GLOUCESTER. Think'st thou I am an executioner?   KING HENRY. A persecutor I am sure thou art.     If murdering innocents be executing,     Why, then thou are an executioner.   GLOUCESTER. Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.   KING HENRY. Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,     Thou hadst not liv'd to kill a son of mine.     And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand     Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear,     And many an old man's sigh, and many a widow's,     And many an orphan's water-standing eye-     Men for their sons, wives for their husbands,     Orphans for their parents' timeless death-     Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born.     The owl shriek'd at thy birth- an evil sign;     The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;     Dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest shook down trees;     The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top,     And chatt'ring pies in dismal discords sung;     Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain,     And yet brought forth less than a mother's hope,     To wit, an indigest deformed lump,     Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.     Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born,     To signify thou cam'st to bite the world;     And if the rest be true which I have heard,     Thou cam'st-   GLOUCESTER. I'll hear no more. Die, prophet, in thy speech.                                                      [Stabs him]     For this, amongst the rest, was I ordain'd.   KING HENRY. Ay, and for much more slaughter after this.     O, God forgive my sins and pardon thee!               [Dies]   GLOUCESTER. What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster     Sink in the ground? I thought it would have mounted.     See how my sword weeps for the poor King's death.     O, may such purple tears be always shed     From those that wish the downfall of our house!     If any spark of life be yet remaining,     Down, down to hell; and say I sent thee thither-                                                [Stabs him again]     I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear.     Indeed, 'tis true that Henry told me of;     For I have often heard my mother say     I came into the world with my legs forward.     Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste     And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?     The midwife wonder'd; and the women cried     'O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!'     And so I was, which plainly signified     That I should snarl, and bite, and play the dog.     Then, since the heavens have shap'd my body so,     Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it.     I have no brother, I am like no brother;     And this word 'love,' which greybeards call divine,     Be resident in men like one another,     And not in me! I am myself alone.     Clarence, beware; thou keep'st me from the light,     But I will sort a pitchy day for thee;     For I will buzz abroad such prophecies     That Edward shall be fearful of his life;     And then to purge his fear, I'll be thy death.     King Henry and the Prince his son are gone.     Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest;     Counting myself but bad till I be best.     I'll throw thy body in another room,     And triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom.                                               Exit with the body SCENE VII. London. The palace Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD, QUEEN ELIZABETH, CLARENCE, GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, NURSE, with the Young PRINCE, and attendants   KING EDWARD. Once more we sit in England's royal throne,     Repurchas'd with the blood of enemies.     What valiant foemen, like to autumn's corn,     Have we mow'd down in tops of all their pride!     Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown'd     For hardy and undoubted champions;     Two Cliffords, as the father and the son;     And two Northumberlands- two braver men     Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound;     With them the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague,     That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion     And made the forest tremble when they roar'd.     Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat     And made our footstool of security.     Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy.     Young Ned, for thee thine uncles and myself     Have in our armours watch'd the winter's night,     Went all afoot in summer's scalding heat,     That thou might'st repossess the crown in peace;     And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain.   GLOUCESTER. [Aside] I'll blast his harvest if your head were laid;     For yet I am not look'd on in the world.     This shoulder was ordain'd so thick to heave;     And heave it shall some weight or break my back.     Work thou the way- and that shall execute.   KING EDWARD. Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen;     And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.   CLARENCE. The duty that I owe unto your Majesty     I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe.   KING EDWARD. Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks.   GLOUCESTER. And that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st,     Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit.     [Aside] To say the truth, so Judas kiss'd his master     And cried 'All hail!' when as he meant all harm.   KING EDWARD. Now am I seated as my soul delights,     Having my country's peace and brothers' loves.   CLARENCE. What will your Grace have done with Margaret?     Reignier, her father, to the King of France     Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem,     And hither have they sent it for her ransom.   KING EDWARD. Away with her, and waft her hence to France.     And now what rests but that we spend the time     With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows,     Such as befits the pleasure of the court?     Sound drums and trumpets. Farewell, sour annoy!     For here, I hope, begins our lasting joy.             Exeunt THE END End of this Etext of The Complete Works of William Shakespeare THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY THE SIXTH
THE ORIGIN AND NATURE of the EMOTIONS Miscellaneous Papers BY GEORGE W. CRILE, M.D. PROFESSOR OF SURGERY, SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY VISITING SURGEON TO THE LAKESIDE HOSPITAL, CLEVELAND EDITED BY AMY F. ROWLAND, B. S. PREFACE IN response to numerous requests I have brought together into this volume eight papers which may serve as a supplement to the volumes previously published[*] and as a preface to monographs now in preparation. [*] Surgical Shock, 1899; Surgery of the Respiratory System, 1899; Problems Relating to Surgical Operations, 1901; Blood Pressure in Surgery, 1903; Hemorrhage and Transfusion, 1909; Anemia and Resuscitation, 1914; and Anoci-association, 1914 (with Dr. W. E. Lower). In the first of these addresses, the Ether Day Address, delivered at the Massachusetts General Hospital in October, 1910, I first enunciated the Kinetic Theory of Shock, the key to which was found in laboratory researches and in a study of Darwin's "Expression of the Emotions in Man and in Animals," whereby the phylogenetic origin of the emotions was made manifest and the pathologic identity of surgical and emotional shock was established. Since 1910 my associates and I have continued our researches through-- (a) Histologic studies of all the organs and tissues of the body; (b) Estimation of the H-ion concentration of the blood in the emotions of anger and fear and after the application of many other forms of stimuli; (c) Functional tests of the adrenals, and (d) Clinical observations. It would seem that if the striking changes produced by fear and anger and by physical trauma in the master organ of the body-- the brain--were due to WORK, then we should expect to find corresponding histologic changes in other organs of the body as well. We therefore examined every organ and tissue of the bodies of animals which had been subjected to intense fear and anger and to infection and to the action of foreign proteins, some animals being killed immediately; some several hours after the immediate effects of the stimuli had passed; some after seances of strong emotion had been repeated several times during a week or longer. The examination of all the tissues and organs of these animals showed changes in three organs only, and with few exceptions in all three of these organs--the brain, the adrenals, and the liver. The extent of these changes is well shown by the photomicrographs which illustrate the paper on "The Kinetic System" which is included in this volume.  This paper describes many experiments which show that the brain, the adrenal, and the liver play together constantly and that no one of these organs--as far at least as is indicated by the histologic studies--can act without the co-operation of the other two. Another striking fact which has been experimentally established is that the deterioration of these three organs caused by emotion, by exertion, and by other causes is largely counteracted, if not exclusively, during sleep.  If animals exhausted by the continued application of a stimulus are allowed complete rest for a certain number of hours, _*without sleep_, the characteristic histologic appearance of exhaustion in the brain, adrenals, and liver is not altered notably, whereas in animals allowed to sleep for the same number of hours the histologic changes in these organs are lessened-- in some cases obliterated even. This significant phenomenon and its relation will be dealt with in a later monograph. Many of the arguments and illustrations by which the primary premises were established are repeated--a few in all--many in more than one of these addresses.  It will be observed, however, that the APPLICATION of these premises varies, and that their SIGNIFICANCE broadens progressively. In the Ether Day Address the phylogenetic key supplied by Darwin was utilized to formulate the principle that the organism reacts as a unit to the stimuli of physical injury, of emotion, of infection, etc. To the study of these reactions (transformations of energy) the epoch-making work of Sherrington, "The Integrative Action of the Nervous System," gave an added key by which the dominating role of the brain was determined.  Later the original work of Cannon on the adrenal glands gave facts, and an experimental method by which Darwin's phylogenetic theory of the emotions was further elaborated in other papers, especially in the one entitled "Phylogenetic Association in Relation to the Emotions," read before The American Philosophical Society in April, 1911.

The discovery of the anesthetic properties of ether and its practical application to surgery must always stand as one of the great achievements of medicine.  It is eminently fitting that the anniversary of that notable day, when the possibilities of ether were first made known to the world, should be celebrated within these walls, and whatever the topic of your Ether Day orator, he must fittingly pause first to pay tribute to that great event and to the master surgeons of the Massachusetts General Hospital.  On this occasion, on behalf of the dumb animals as well as on behalf of suffering humanity, I express a deep sense of gratitude for the blessings of anesthesia. Two years ago, an historic appreciation of the discovery of ether was presented here by Professor Welch, and last year an address on medical research was given by President Eliot.  I, therefore, will not attempt a general address, but will invite your attention to an experimental and clinical study.  In presenting the summaries of the large amount of data in these researches, I acknowledge with gratitude the great assistance rendered by my associates, Dr. D. H. Dolley, Dr. H. G. Sloan, Dr. J. B. Austin, and Dr. M. L. Menten.[*] [*] From the H. K. Cushing Laboratory of Experimental Medicine, Western Reserve University, Cleveland. The scope of this paper may be explained by a concrete example. When a barefoot boy steps on a sharp stone there is an immediate discharge of nervous energy in his effort to escape from the wounding stone. This is not a voluntary act.  It is not due to his own personal experience-- his ontogeny--but is due to the experience of his progenitors during the vast periods of time required for the evolution of the species to which he belongs, _i.  e_., his phylogeny. The wounding stone made an impression upon the nerve receptors in the foot similar to the innumerable injuries which gave origin to this nerve mechanism itself during the boy's vast phylogenetic or ancestral experience.  The stone supplied the phylogenetic association, and the appropriate discharge of nervous energy automatically followed. If the sole of the foot be repeatedly bruised or crushed by a stone, shock may be produced; if the stone be only lightly applied, then the consequent sensation of tickling causes a discharge of nervous energy.  In like manner there have been implanted in the body other mechanisms of ancestral or phylogenetic origin whose purpose is the discharge of nervous energy for the good of the individual. In this paper I shall discuss the origin and mode of action of some of these mechanisms and their relation to certain phases of anesthesia. The word anesthesia--meaning WITHOUT FEELING--describes accurately the effect of ether in anesthetic dosage.  Although no pain is felt in operations under inhalation anesthesia, the _*nerve impulses excited by a surgical operation still reach the brain_. We know that not every portion of the brain is fully anesthetized, since surgical anesthesia does not kill.  The question then is: What effect has trauma under surgical anesthesia upon the part of the brain THAT REMAINS AWAKE?  If, in surgical anesthesia, the traumatic impulses cause an excitation of the wide-awake cells, are the remainder of the cells of the brain, despite anesthesia, affected in any way?  If so, they are prevented by the anesthesia from expressing that influence in conscious perception or in muscular action. Whether the ANESTHETIZED cells are influenced or not must be determined by noting the physiologic functions of the body after anesthesia has worn off, and in animals by an examination of the brain-cells as well. It has long been known that the vasomotor, the cardiac, and the respiratory centers discharge energy in response to traumatic stimuli applied to various sensitive regions of the body during surgical anesthesia. If the trauma be sufficient, exhaustion of the entire brain will be observed after the effect of the anesthesia has worn off; that is to say, despite the complete paralysis of voluntary motion and the loss of consciousness due to ether, the traumatic impulses that are known to reach the AWAKE centers in the medulla also reach and influence every other part of the brain. Whether or not the consequent functional depression and the morphologic alterations seen in the brain-cells may be due to the low blood-pressure which follows excessive trauma is shown by the following experiments: The circulation of animals was first rendered STATIC by over-transfusion, and was controlled by a continuous blood-pressure record on a drum, the factor of anemia being thereby wholly excluded during the application of the trauma and during the removal of a specimen of brain tissue for histologic study.  In each instance, morphologic changes in the cells of all parts of the brain were found, but it required much more trauma to produce brain-cell changes in animals whose blood-pressure was kept at the normal level than in the animals whose blood-pressure was allowed to take a downward course. In the cortex and in the cerebellum, the changes in the brain-cells were in every instance more marked than in the medulla. There is also strong NEGATIVE evidence that traumatic impulses are not excluded by ether anesthesia from the part of the brain that is apparently asleep.  This evidence is as follows: If the factor of fear be excluded, and if in addition the traumatic impulses be prevented from reaching the brain by cocain[*] blocking, then, despite the intensity or the duration of the trauma within the zone so blocked, there follows no exhaustion after the effect of the anesthetic disappears, and no morphologic changes are noted in the brain-cells. [*] Since the presentation of this paper, novocain has been substituted for cocain in operations under anoci-association. Still further negative evidence that inhalation anesthesia offers little or no protection to the brain-cells against trauma is derived from the following experiment:  A dog whose spinal cord had been divided at the level of the first dorsal segment, and which had then been kept in good condition for two months, showed a recovery of the spinal reflexes, such as the scratch reflex, etc.  Such an animal is known as a "spinal dog."  Now, in this animal, the abdomen and hind extremities had no direct nerve connection with the brain. In this dog, continuous severe trauma of the abdominal viscera and of the hind extremities lasting for four <p 5-7> hours was accompanied by but slight change in either the circulation or in the respiration, and by no microscopic alteration of the brain-cells (Fig. 1). Judging from a large number of experiments on NORMAL dogs under ether, such an amount of trauma would have caused not only complete physiologic exhaustion of the brain, but also morphologic alterations of all of the brain-cells and the physical destruction of many (Fig. 2). We must, therefore, conclude that, although ether anesthesia produces unconsciousness, it APPARENTLY PROTECTS NONE OF THE BRAIN-CELLS against exhaustion from the trauma of surgical operations; ether is, so to speak, but a veneer.  Under nitrous oxid anesthesia there is approximately only one-fourth as much exhaustion as is produced by equal trauma under ether (Fig. 3). We must conclude, therefore, either that nitrous oxid protects the brain-cells against trauma or that ether predisposes the brain-cells to exhaustion as a result of trauma. With these premises let us now inquire into the cause of this exhaustion of the brain-cells. The Cause of the Exhaustion of the Brain-cells as a Result of Trauma of Various Parts of the Body under Inhalation Anesthesia Numerous experiments on animals to determine the effect of ether anesthesia _per se_, _i.  e_., ether anesthesia without trauma, showed that, although certain changes were produced, these included neither the physiologic exhaustion nor the alterations in the brain-cells which are characteristic of the effects of trauma. On turning to the study of trauma, we at once found in the behavior of individuals as a whole under deep and under light anesthesia the clue to the cause of the discharge of energy, of the consequent physiologic exhaustion, and of the morphologic changes in the brain-cells. If, in the course of abdominal operations, rough manipulations of the parietal peritoneum be made, there will be frequently observed a marked increase in the respiratory rate and an increase in the expiratory force which may be marked by the production of an audible expiratory groan.  Under light ether anesthesia, severe manipulations of the peritoneum often cause such vigorous contractions of the abdominal muscles that the operator is greatly hindered in his work. Among the unconscious responses to trauma under ether anesthesia are purposeless moving, the withdrawal of the injured part, and, if the anesthesia be sufficiently light and the trauma sufficiently strong, there may be an effort toward escape from the injury. In injury under ether anesthesia every grade of response may be seen, from the slightest change in the respiration or in the blood-pressure to a vigorous defensive struggle.  As to the purpose of these subconscious movements in response to injury, there can be no doubt-- THEY ARE EFFORTS TO ESCAPE FROM THE INJURY. Picture what would be the result of a formidable abdominal operation extending over a period of half an hour or more on an unanesthetized human patient, during which extensive adhesions had been broken up, or a large tumor dislodged from its bed!  In such a case, would not the nervous system discharge its energy to the utmost in efforts to escape from the injury, and would not the patient suffer complete exhaustion?  If the traumata under inhalation anesthesia are sufficiently strong and are repeated in sufficient numbers, the brain-cells are finally deprived of their dischargeable nervous energy and become exhausted just as exhaustion follows such strenuous and prolonged muscular exertion as is seen in endurance tests. Whether the energy of the brain be discharged by injury under anesthesia or by ordinary muscular exertion, identical morphologic changes are seen in the nerve-cells. In shock from injury (Fig. 2), in exhaustion from overwork (Hodge and Dolley) (Fig. 4), and in exhaustion from pure fear (Fig. 5), the resultant general functional weakness is similar-- in each case a certain length of time is required to effect recovery, and in each there are morphologic changes in the brain-cells. It is quite clear that in each of these cases the altered function and form of the brain-cells are due to an _*excessive discharge of nervous energy_.  This brings us to the next question: What determines the discharge of energy as a result of trauma with or without inhalation anesthesia? The Cause of the Discharge of Nervous Energy as a Result of Trauma under Inhalation Anesthesia and under Normal Conditions I looked into this problem from many viewpoints and there seemed to be no solution until it occurred to me to seek the explanation in certain of the postulates which make up the doctrine of evolution. I realize fully the difficulty and the danger in attempting to reach the generalization which I shall make later and in the hypothesis I shall propose, for there is, of course, no direct final proof of the truth of even the doctrine of evolution. It is idle to consider any experimental research into the cause of phenomena that have developed by natural selection during millions of years.  Nature herself has made the experiments on a world-wide scale and the data are before us for interpretation. Darwin could do no more than to collect all available facts and then to frame the hypothesis by which the facts were best harmonized. Sherrington, that masterly physiologist, in his volume entitled "The Integrative Action of the Nervous System," shows clearly how the central nervous system was built up in the process of evolution. Sherrington has made free use of Darwin's doctrine in explaining physiologic functions, just as anatomists have extensively utilized it in the explanation of the genesis of anatomic forms. I shall assume, therefore, that the discharge of nervous energy is accomplished by the application of the laws of inheritance and association, and I conclude that this hypothesis will explain many clinical phenomena. I shall now present such evidence in favor of this hypothesis as time and my limitations will admit, after which I shall point out certain clinical facts that may be explained by this hypothesis. According to the doctrine of evolution, every function owes its origin to natural selection in the struggle for existence. In the lower and simpler forms of animal life, indeed, in our human progenitors as well, existence depended principally upon the success with which three great purposes were achieved: (1) Self-defense against or escape from enemies; (2) the acquisition of food; and (3) procreation; and these were virtually the only purposes for which nervous energy was discharged.  In its last analysis, in a biologic sense, this statement holds true of man today. Disregarding for the present the expenditure of energy for procuring food and for procreation, let us consider the discharge of energy for self-preservation. The mechanisms for self-defense which we now possess were developed in the course of vast periods of time through innumerable intermediary stages from those possessed by the lowest forms of life.  One would suppose, therefore, that we must now be in possession of mechanisms which still discharge energy on adequate stimulation, but which are not suited to our present needs. We shall point out some examples of such unnecessary mechanisms. As Sherrington has stated, our skin, in which are implanted many receptors for receiving specific stimuli which are transmitted to the brain, is interposed between ourselves and the environment in which we are immersed.  When these stimuli reach the brain, there is a specific response, principally in the form of muscular action.  Now, each receptor can be adequately stimulated only by the particular factor or factors in the environment which created the necessity for the existence of that receptor. Thus there have arisen receptors for touch, for temperature, for pain, etc.  The receptors for pain have been designated _nociceptors_ (nocuous or harmful) by Sherrington. On the basis of natural selection, nociceptors could have developed in only those regions of the body which have been exposed to injury during long periods of time.  On this ground the finger, because it is exposed, should have many nociceptors, while the brain, though the most important organ of the body, should have no nociceptors because, during a vast period of time, it has been protected by a skull. Realizing that this point is a crucial one, Dr. Sloan and I made a series of careful experiments.  The cerebral hemispheres of dogs were exposed by removing the skull and dura under ether and local anesthesia. Then various portions of the hemispheres were slowly but completely destroyed by rubbing them with pieces of gauze. In some instances a hemisphere was destroyed by burning. In no case was there more than a slight response of the centers governing circulation and respiration, and no morphologic change was noted in an histologic study of the brain-cells of the uninjured hemisphere. The experiment was as completely negative as were the experiments on the "spinal dog."  Clinically I have confirmed these experimental findings when I have explored the brains of conscious patients with a probe to determine the presence of brain tumors. Such explorations elicited neither pain nor any evidence of altered physiologic functions.  The brain, therefore, contains no mechanism-- no nociceptors--the direct stimulation of which can cause a discharge of nervous energy in a self-defensive action. That is to say, direct injury of the brain can cause no purposeful nerve-muscular action, while direct injury of the finger does cause purposeful nerve-muscular action.  In like manner, the deeper portions of the spinal region have been sheltered from trauma and they, too, show but little power of causing a discharge of nervous energy on receiving trauma.  The various tissues and organs of the body are differently endowed with injury receptors--the nociceptors of Sherrington.  The abdomen and chest when traumatized stand first in their facility for causing the discharge of nervous energy, _i. e_., THEY STAND FIRST IN SHOCK PRODUCTION.  Then follow the extremities, the neck, and the back.  It is an interesting fact also that different types of trauma elicit different responses as far as the consequent discharge of energy is concerned. Because it is such a commonplace observation, one scarcely realizes the importance of the fact that clean-cut wounds inflicted by a razor-like knife cause the least reaction, while a tearing, crushing trauma causes the greatest response.  It is a suggestive fact that the greatest shock is produced by any technic which imitates the methods of attack and of slaughter used by the carnivora. _*In the course of evolution, injuries thus produced may well have been the predominating type of traumata to which our progenitors were subjected_.  In one particular respect there is an analogy between the response to trauma of some parts of the body of the individuals of a species susceptible to shock and the response to trauma of the individuals in certain other great divisions of the animal kingdom. Natural selection has protected the crustaceans against their enemies by protective armor, _e.  g_., the turtle and the armadillo; to the birds, it has given sharp eyes and wings, as, for instance, the wild goose to another species--the skunk--it has given a noisome odor for its protection.  The turtle, protected by its armor against trauma, is in a very similar position to that of the sheltered brain of man and, like the brain, the turtle does not respond to trauma by an especially active self-protective nerve-muscular response, but merely withdraws its head and legs within the armored protection. It is proverbially difficult to exhaust or to kill this animal by trauma. The brain and other phylogenetically sheltered parts likewise give no exhausting self-protective nerve-muscular response to trauma.  The skunk is quite effectively protected from violence by its peculiar odor. This is indicated not only by the protective value of the odor itself, but also by the fact that the skunk has no efficient nerve-muscular mechanism for escape or defense; it can neither run fast nor can it climb a tree.  Moreover, in encounters it shows no fear and backs rather than runs.  The armadillo rolls itself into a ball for defense. On these premises we should conclude that the turtle, the armadillo, and the skunk have fewer nociceptors than has a dog or man, and that they would show less response to trauma. In two carefully conducted experiments on skunks and two on armadillos (an insufficient number) the energy discharged in response to severe and protracted trauma of the abdominal viscera was very much less than in similar experiments on dogs, opossums, pigs, sheep, and rabbits. It was indeed relatively difficult to exhaust the skunks and armadillos by trauma.  These experiments are too few to be conclusive, but they are of some value and furnish an excellent lead. It seems more than a coincidence that proneness to fear, distribution of nociceptors, and susceptibility to shock go hand-in-hand in these comparative observations (Figs. 6, 7, and 8). The discharge of energy caused by an adequate mechanical stimulation of the nociceptors is best explained in accordance with the law of phylogenetic association.  That is, injuries awaken those reflex actions which by natural selection have been developed for the purpose of self-protection. Adequate stimulation of the nociceptors for pain is not the only means by which a discharge of nervous energy is caused. Nervous energy may be discharged also by adequate stimulation of the various ticklish regions of the body; the entire skin surface of the body contains delicate ticklish receptors. These receptors are closely related to the nociceptors for pain, and their adequate stimulation by an insect-like touch causes a discharge of energy,--a nerve-muscular reaction,-- resembling that developed for the purpose of brushing off insects. This reflex is similar to the scratch reflex in the dog. The discharge of energy is almost wholly independent of the will and is a self-protective action in the same sense as is the response to pain stimuli.  The ear in man and in animals is acutely ticklish, the adequate stimulus being any foreign body, especially a buzzing, insect-like contact.  The discharge of nervous energy in horses and in cattle on adequate stimulation of the ticklish receptors of the ear is so extraordinary that in the course of evolution it must have been of great importance to the safety of the animal. A similar ticklish zone guards the nasal chambers, the discharge of energy here taking a form which effectively dislodges the foreign body. The larynx is exquisitely ticklish, and, in response to any adequate stimulus, energy is discharged in the production of a vigorous cough. The mouth and pharynx have active receptors which cause the rejection of noxious substances.  The conjunctival reflex, though not classed as ticklish, is a most efficient self-protective reflex. I assume that there is no doubt as to the relation between the adequate stimuli and the nerve-muscular response of the various ticklish receptors of the surface of the skin, of the ear, the nose, the eye, and the larynx.  These mechanisms were developed by natural selection as protective measures against the intrusion of insects and foreign bodies into regions of great importance. The discharge of energy in these instances is in accordance with the laws of inheritance and association.  The other ticklish points which are capable of discharging vast amounts of energy are the lateral chest-wall, the abdomen, the loins, the neck, and the soles of the feet.  The type of adequate stimuli of the soles of the feet, the distribution of the ticklish points upon them, and the associated response, leave no doubt that these ticklish points were long ago established as a means of protection from injury. Under present conditions they are of little value to man. The adequate stimulus for the ticklish points of the ribs, the loins, the abdomen, and the neck is deep isolated pressure, probably the most adequate being pressure by a tooth-shaped body. The response to tickling in these regions is actively and obviously self-defensive. The horse discharges energy in the form of a kick; the dog wriggles and makes a counter-bite; the man makes efforts at defense and escape. There is strong evidence that the deep ticklish points of the body were developed through vast periods of fighting with teeth and claws (Fig. 9). Even puppies at play bite each other in their ticklish points and thus give a recapitulation of their ancestral battles and of the real battles to come (Fig. 10). The mere fact that animals fight effectively in the dark and always according to the habit of their species supports the belief that the fighting of animals is not an intellectual but a reflex process.  There are no rules which govern the conduct of a fight between animals.  The events follow each other with such kaleidoscopic rapidity that the process is but a series of automatic stimulations and physiologic reactions. Whatever their significance, therefore, it is certain that man did not come either accidentally or without purpose into possession of the deep ticklish regions of his chest and abdomen. Should any one doubt the vast power that adequate stimulation of these regions possesses in causing the discharge of energy, let him be bound hand and foot and vigorously tickled for an hour. What would happen?  He would be as completely exhausted as though he had experienced a major surgical operation or had run a Marathon race. A close analogy to the reflex process in the fighting of animals is shown in the role played by the sexual receptors in conjugation. Adequate stimulation of either of these two distinct groups of receptors, the sexual and the noci, causes specific behavior-- the one toward embrace, the other toward repulsion.  Again, one of the most peremptory causes of the discharge of energy is that due to an attempt to obstruct forcibly the mouth and the nose so that asphyxia is threatened.  Under such conditions neither friend nor foe is trusted, and a desperate struggle for air ensues. It will be readily granted that the reactions to prevent suffocation were established for the purpose of self-preservation, but the discharge of nerve-muscular energy to this particular end is no more specific and no more shows adaptive qualities than do the preceding examples. Even the proposal to bind one down hand and foot excites resentment, a feeling originally suggested by the need for self-preservation. No patient views with equanimity the application of shackles as a preparation for anesthesia. We have now considered some of the causes of those discharges of nervous energy which result from various types of harmful physical contact, and have referred to the analogous, though antithetical, response to the stimulation of the sexual receptors. The response to the adequate stimuli of each of the several receptors is a discharge of nerve-muscular energy of a specific type; that is, there is one type of response for the ear, one for the larynx, one for the pharynx, another for the nose, another for the eye, another for the deep ticklish points of the chest and the abdomen, quite another for the delicate tickling of the skin, and still another type of response to sexual stimuli. According to Sherrington, a given receptor has a low threshold for only one, its own specific stimulus, and a high threshold for all others; that is, the doors that guard the nerve-paths to the brain are opened only when the proper password is received. According to Sherrington's law, the individual as a whole responds to but one stimulus at a time, that is, only one stimulus occupies the nerve-paths which carry the impulses as a result of which acts are performed, _i.  e_., the final common path. As soon as a stronger stimulus reaches the brain it dispossesses whatever other stimulus is then occupying the final common path-- the path of action.  The various receptors have a definite order of precedence over each other (Sherrington). For example, the impulse from the delicate ticklish points of the skin, whose adequate stimulus is an insect-like contact, could not successfully compete for the final common path with the stimulus of a nociceptor. The stimulus of a fly on the nose would be at once superseded by the crushing of a finger.  In quick succession do the various receptors (Sherrington) occupy the final common path, but each stimulus is for the time the sole possessor, hence the nervous system is integrated (connected) to act as a whole.  Each individual at every moment of life has a limited amount of dischargeable nervous energy. This energy is at the disposal of any stimulus that obtains possession of the final common path, and results in the performance of an act. Each discharge of energy is subtracted from the sum total of stored energy and, whether the subtractions are made by the excitation of nociceptors by trauma, by tickling, by fighting, by fear, by flight, or by the excitation of sexual receptors, by any of these singly or in combination with others, the sum total of the expenditure of energy, if large enough, produces exhaustion. Apparently there is no distinction between that state of exhaustion which is due to the discharge of nervous energy in response to trauma and that due to other causes.  The manner of the discharge of energy is specific for each type of stimulation. On this conception, traumatic shock takes its place as a natural phenomenon and is divested of its mask of mystery. The Discharge of Energy through Stimulation of the Distance Receptors, or through Representation of Injury (Psychic) We will now turn from the discussion of the discharge of nervous energy by mechanical stimuli to the discharge of energy through mental perception. _Phylogenetic_ association may result from stimulation of the distance receptors through sight, hearing, smell, or by a representation of physical experiences, as well as from physical contact. The effect upon the organism of the representation of injury or of the perception of danger through the distance receptors is designated FEAR.  Fear is as widely distributed in nature as is its cause, that is, fear is as widely distributed as injury.  Animals under the stimulus of fear, according to W. T. Hornaday, not only may exhibit preternatural strength, but also may show strategy of the highest order, a strategy not seen under the influence of a lesser stimulus. In some animals fear is so intense that it defeats escape; this is especially true in the case of birds in the presence of snakes. The power of flight has endowed the bird with an easy means of escape from snakes, especially when the encounter is in the tops of trees. Here the snake must move cautiously, else he will lose his equilibrium; his method of attack is by stealth.  When the snake has stalked its prey, the bird is often so overcome by fear that it cannot fly and so becomes an easy victim (Fig. 11). The phenomena of fear are described by Darwin as follows: "Fear is often preceded by astonishment, and is so near akin to it that both lead to the senses of sight and hearing being instantly aroused. In both cases the eyes and mouth are widely opened and the eyebrows raised.  The frightened man at first stands like a statue, motionless and breathless, or crouches down as if instinctively to escape observation.  The heart beats quickly and violently, so that it palpitates or knocks against the ribs.  * * * That the skin is much affected under the sense of great fear we see in the marvelous and inexplicable manner in which perspiration immediately exudes from it. This exudation is all the more remarkable as the surface is then cold, and hence the term, `a cold sweat'; whereas the sudorific glands are properly excited into action when the surface is heated. The hairs also on the skin stand erect, and the superficial muscles shiver.  In connection with the disturbed action of the heart, the breathing is hurried.  The salivary glands act imperfectly; the mouth becomes dry, and is often opened and shut.  I have also noticed that under slight fear there is a strong tendency to yawn. One of the best-marked symptoms is the trembling of all the muscles of the body; and this is often first seen in the lips. From this cause, and from the dryness of the mouth, the voice becomes husky and indistinct, or may altogether fail. * * * As fear increases into agony of terror, we behold, as under all violent emotions, diversified results.  The heart beats wildly, or may fail to act and faintness ensues; there is death-like pallor; the breathing is labored; the wings of the nostrils are widely dilated; `there is a gasping and convulsive motion of the lips, a tremor on the hollow cheek, a gulping and catching of the throat'; the uncovered and protruding eyeballs are fixed on the object of terror; or they may roll restlessly from side to side.  * * * The pupils are said to be enormously dilated.  All the muscles of the body may become rigid, or may be thrown into convulsive movements. The hands are alternately clenched and opened, often with a twitching movement.  The arms may be protruded, as if to avert some dreadful danger, or may be thrown wildly over the head. * * * In other cases there is a sudden and uncontrollable tendency to headlong flight; and so strong is this that the boldest soldiers may be seized with a sudden panic.  As fear rises to an extreme pitch, the dreadful scream of terror is heard.  Great beads of sweat stand on the skin.  All the muscles of the body are relaxed. Utter prostration soon follows, and the mental powers fail. The intestines are affected.  The sphincter muscles cease to act and no longer retain the contents of the body. * * * Men, during numberless generations, have endeavored to escape from their enemies or danger by headlong flight, or by violently struggling with them; and such great exertions will have caused the heart to beat rapidly, the breathing to be hurried, the chest to heave, and the nostrils to be dilated. As these exertions have often been prolonged to the last extremity, the final result will have been utter prostration, pallor, perspiration, trembling of all the muscles, or their complete relaxation. And now, whenever the emotion of fear is strongly felt, though it may not lead to any exertion, the same results tend to reappear, through the force of inheritance and association"[*] (Fig. 12). [*] Darwin:  Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. In an experimental research, we found evidence that the physiologic phenomena of fear have a physical basis.  This evidence is found in the morphologic alterations in the brain-cells, which are similar to those observed in certain stages of surgical shock and in fatigue from muscular exertion (Figs. 2, 4, 5, and 13). For the present, we shall assume that fear is a REPRESENTATION of trauma. Because fear was created by trauma, fear causes a discharge of the energy of the nervous system by the law of phylogenetic association. The almost universal fear of snakes, of blood, and of death and dead bodies may have such a phylogenetic origin. It was previously stated that under the stimulus of fear animals show preternatural strength.  An analysis of the phenomena of fear shows that, as far as can be determined, all the functions of the body requiring the expenditure of energy, and which are of no direct assistance in the effort toward self-preservation, are suspended. In the voluntary expenditure of muscular energy, as in the chase, the suspension of other functions is by no means so complete. Fear and trauma may drain to the last dreg the dischargeable nervous energy, and, therefore, the greatest possible exhaustion may be produced by fear and trauma. Summation In the discharge of energy, summation plays an important role. Summation is attained by the repetition of stimuli at such a rate that each succeeding stimulus is applied before the nerve-cells have returned to the resting stage from the preceding stimulus. If drops of water fall upon the skin from a sufficient height to cause the slightest unpleasant sensation, and at such a rate that before the effect of the stimulus of one drop has passed another drop falls in precisely the same spot, there will be felt a gradually increasing painful sensation which finally becomes unbearable. This is summation of stimuli.  When, for a long time, a patient requires frequent painful wound dressings, there is a gradual increase in the acuteness of the pain of the receptors. This is caused by summation.  In a larger sense, the entire behavior of the individual gives considerable evidence of summation, _e. g_., in the training of athletes, the rhythmic discharge of muscular energy at such intervals that the resting stage is not reached before a new exercise is given results in a gradual ascent in efficiency until the maximum is reached.  This is summation, and summation plays a large role in the development of both normal and pathologic phenomena. We have now pointed out the manner in which at least a part of the nervous energy of man may be discharged. The integrative action of the nervous system and the discharge of nervous energy by phylogenetic association may be illustrated by their analogy to the action of an electric automobile. The electric automobile is composed of four principal parts: The motor and the wheels (the muscular system and the skeleton); the cells of the battery containing stored electricity (brain-cells, nervous energy); the controller, which is connected with the cells by wiring (the receptors and the nerve-fibers); and an accelerator for increasing the electric discharge (thyroid gland?). The machine is so constructed that it acts as a whole for the accomplishment of a single purpose. When the controller is adjusted for going ahead (adequate stimulus of a receptor), then the conducting paths (the final common path) for the accomplishment of that purpose are all open to the flow of the current from the battery, and the vehicle is integrated to go ahead. It spends its energy to that end and is closed to all other impulses. When the controller is set for reverse, by this adequate stimulus the machine is integrated to back, and the battery is closed to all other impulses.  Whether integrated for going forward or backward, if the battery be discharged at a proper rate until exhausted, the cells, though possessing no more power (fatigue), have sustained no further impairment of their elements than that of normal wear and tear.  Furthermore, they may be restored to normal activity by recharging (rest). If the vehicle be placed against a stone wall, and the controller be placed at high-speed (trauma and fear), and if the accelerator be used as well (thyroid secretion?), though the machine will not move, not only will the battery soon be exhausted, but the battery elements themselves will be seriously damaged (exhaustion--surgical shock). We have now presented some evidence that nervous energy is discharged by the adequate stimulation of one or more of the various receptors that have been developed in the course of evolution. In response to an adequate stimulus, the nervous system is integrated for a specific purpose by the stimulated receptor, and but one stimulus at a time has possession of the final common path-- the nerve mechanisms for action.  The most numerous receptors are those for harmful contact; these are the nociceptors. The effect of the adequate stimulus of a nociceptor is like that of pressing an electric button that sets great machinery in motion. With this conception, the human body may be likened to a musical instrument--an organ--the keyboard of which is composed of the various receptors, upon which environment plays the many tunes of life; and written within ourselves in symbolic language is the history of our evolution.  The skin may be the "Rosetta Stone" which furnishes the key. Anoci-association By the law of phylogenetic association, we are now prepared to make a practical application of the principles of the discharge of nervous energy.  In the case of a surgical operation, if fear be excluded and if the nerve-paths between the field of operation and the brain be blocked with cocain,[*] no discharge of energy will be caused by the operation; hence no shock, no exhaustion, can result. Under such conditions the nervous system is protected against noci-association, resulting from noci-perception or from an adequate stimulation of nociceptors.  The state of the patient in whom all noci-associations are excluded can be described only by coining a new word.  That word is "anoci-association" (Fig. 14). [*] See footnote, page 4.@@@ The difference between anesthesia and anoci-association is that, although _inhalation anesthesia_ confers the beneficent loss of consciousness and freedom from pain, it does not prevent the nerve impulses from reaching and influencing the brain, and therefore does not prevent surgical shock nor the train of later nervous impairments so well described by Mumford.  _Anoci-association_ excludes fear, pain, shock, and postoperative neuroses.  _Anoci-association_ is accomplished by combining the special management of patients (applied psychology), morphin, inhalation anesthesia, and local anesthesia. We have now presented in summary much of the mass of experimental and clinical evidence we have accumulated in support of our principal theme, which is that the discharge of nervous energy is accomplished in accordance with the law of phylogenetic association. If this point seems to have been emphasized unduly, it is because we expect to rear upon this foundation a clinical structure. How does this hypothesis apply to surgical operations? Prevention of Shock by the Application of the Principle of Anoci-association Upon this hypothesis a new principle in operative surgery is founded, _i. e_., operation during the state of _anoci-association_. Assuming that no unfavorable effect is produced by the anesthetic and that there is no hemorrhage, the cells of the brain cannot be exhausted in the course of a surgical operation except by fear or by trauma, or by both. Fear may be excluded by narcotics and special management until the patient is rendered unconscious by inhalation anesthesia. Then if, in addition to inhalation anesthesia, the nerve-paths between the brain and the field of operation are blocked with cocain,[*] the patient will be placed in the beneficent state of _anoci-association_, and at the completion of the operation will be as free from shock as at the beginning.  In so-called "fair risks" such precautions may not be necessary, but in cases handicapped by infections, by anemia, by previous shock, and by Graves' disease, etc., anoci-association may become vitally important. [*] See footnote, page 4.@@@ Graves' Disease By applying the principle of the discharge of nervous energy by phylogenetic association, and by making the additional hypothesis that in the discharge of nervous energy the thyroid gland is stimulated through the nervous system, we can explain many of the phenomena of Graves' disease and may possibly discover some of the factors which explain both its genesis and its cure. In the wild state of animal life in which only the fittest survive in the struggle for existence, every point of advantage has its value.  An animal engaged in battle or in a desperate effort to escape will be able to give a better account of itself if it have some means of accelerating the discharge of energy-- some influence like that of pouring oil upon the kindling fire. There is evidence, though perhaps it is not conclusive, that such an influence is exerted by the thyroid gland. In myxedema, a condition characterized by a lack of thyroid secretion, there is dulness of the reflexes and of the intellect, a lowered muscular power, and generally a sluggish discharge of energy. In Graves' disease there is an excessive production of thyroid secretion. In this disease the reflexes are increased, the discharge of energy is greatly facilitated, and metabolism is at a maximum. The same phenomena occur also after the administration of thyroid extract in large doses to normal subjects.  In the course of sexual activities there is an increased action of the thyroid, which is indicated by an increase in its size and vascularity. That in fear and in injury the thyroid, in cases of Graves' disease, is probably stimulated to increased activity is indicated by the increased activity of the thyroid circulation, by an increase in the size of the gland, by the histologic appearance of activity in the nuclei of the cells, and by an increase of the toxic symptoms. Finally, Asher has stated that electric stimulation of the nerve supply of the thyroid causes an increased secretion.  The origin of many cases of Graves' disease is closely associated with some of the causes of the discharge of nervous energy, depressive influences especially, such as nervous shocks, worry and nervous strain, disappointment in love, business reverses, illness and death of relatives and friends. The association of thyroid activity with procreation is well known, hence the coincidence of a strain of overwork or of fear with the sexual development of maturing girls is obviously favorable to the incidence of Graves' disease.  The presence of a colloid goiter is a suitable soil for the development of Graves' disease, and I fully recognize also the evidence that infection or auto-intoxication may be contributing factors and must be assigned their role. I have never known a case of Graves' disease to be caused by success or happiness alone, or by hard physical labor unattended by psychic strain, or to be the result of energy voluntarily discharged. Some cases seem to have had their origin in overdosage with thyroid extract in too vigorous an attempt to cure a colloid goiter. One of the most striking characteristics of Graves' disease is the patient's loss of control and his increased susceptibility to stimuli, especially to trauma and to fear and to the administration of thyroid extract.  It has been shown that the various causes of the discharge of nervous energy produce alterations in the nervous system and probably in the thyroid gland.  This is especially true of the fear stimulus, and has been clearly demonstrated in the brains of rabbits which had been subjected to fear alone (Fig. 13). Of special interest was the effect of daily fright. In this case the brain-cells showed a distinct change, although the animal had been subjected to no fear for twenty-four hours before it was killed (Fig. 13 C. Now, a great distinction between man and the lower animals is the greater control man has acquired over his actions. This quality of control, having been phylogenetically most recently acquired, is the most vulnerable to various NOCUOUS influences. The result of a constant noci-integration may be a wearing-out of the control cells of the brain.  In a typical case of Graves' disease a marked morphologic change in the brain-cells has been demonstrated (Fig. 15). As has been previously stated, the origin of many cases of Graves' disease is associated with some noci-influence. If this influence causes stimulation of both the brain and the thyroid, its excessive action may cause impairment of the brain and also hyperplasia of the thyroid. As self-control is impaired, fear obtains an ascendency and, _pari passu_, stimulates the thyroid still more actively (Fig. 16). Finally, the fear of the disease itself becomes a noci-stimulus. As the thyroid secretion causes an increase in the facility with which nervous energy is discharged, a pathologic reciprocal interaction is established between the brain and the thyroid. The effect of the constantly recurring stimulus of the noci-influence is heightened by summation.  This reciprocal goading may continue until either the brain or the thyroid is destroyed. If the original noci-stimulus is withdrawn before the fear of the disease becomes too strong, and before too much injury to the brain and the thyroid has been inflicted, a spontaneous cure may result. Recovery may be greatly facilitated by complete therapeutic rest. A cure implies the return of the brain-cells to their normal state, with the reestablishment of the normal self-control and the restoration of the thyroid to its normal state, when the impulses of daily life will once more have possession of the final common path and the noci-influence will be dispossessed. The discovery of the real cause of a given case of Graves' disease is frequently difficult because it may be of a painful personal nature. Of extreme interest is the fact that, in the acute stage, the patient may be unable to refer to the exciting cause without exhibiting an exacerbation of the symptoms of the disease. I presume no case should be regarded as cured until reference can be made to its cause without an abnormal reaction. It has been established that in Graves' disease injury to any part of the body, even under inhalation anesthesia, causes an exacerbation of the disease.  Fear alone may cause an acute exacerbation. These acute exacerbations are frequently designated "hyperthyroidism" and are the special hazard of operation. In applying the principle of anoci-association in operations on patients with Graves' disease there is scarcely a change in the pulse, in the respiration, or in the nervous state at the close of the operation. I know no remedy which can obviate the effect of the inflowing stimuli from the wound after the cocain[*] has worn off.[t] It is necessary, therefore, Beats 70 80 90 100 110 120 Ether ******* ******** ******** ******** ******** N2O ******* ******** ******** ******** * Anoci.  ******* ******** ******** ** not to venture too far in serious cases.  Since the adoption of this new method (anoci-association) my operative results have been so vastly improved that I now rarely regard any case of Graves' disease as inoperable, at least to the extent of contraindicating a double ligation (Fig. 17). [*] See footnote, page 4.@@@ [t] In later papers and in "Anoci-association" (Crile and Lower) methods of combating postoperative hyperthyroidism are fully discussed. If we believe that, in accordance with the law of phylogenetic association, a continuous stimulation of both the brain and the thyroid gland, accelerated by summation, plays a role in the establishment of the pathologic interaction seen in Graves' disease, then it is but the next step to assume that if the nerve connection between the brain and the thyroid be severed, or if the lobe be excised and the patient reinforced by a sojourn in a sanatorium or in some environment free from former noci-associations, he may be restored to normal health, provided that the brain-cells, the heart, or other essential organs have not suffered irreparable damage. There are still many missing links in the solution of this problem, and the foregoing hypotheses are not offered as final, although from the viewpoint of the surgeon many of the phenomena of this disease are explicable. Sexual-Neurasthenia The state of sexual neurasthenia is in many respects analogous to that of Graves' disease.  In the sexual reflexes, summation leads to a hyperexcitability by psychic and mechanical stimuli of a specific type which is analogous to the hyperexcitability in Graves' disease under trauma and fear; the explanation of both conditions is based on the laws of the discharge of energy by phylogenetic association and summation.  It would be interesting to observe the effect of interrupting the nerve impulses from the field of the sexual receptors by injections of alcohol, or by other agencies, so as to exclude the associational stimuli until the nervous mechanism has again become restored to its normal condition. Interpretation of Some of the Phenomena of Certain Diseases of the Abdomen in Accordance with the Hypothesis of Phylogenetic Association The law of phylogenetic association seems to explain many of the phenomena of certain lesions in the abdominal cavity. The nociceptors in the abdomen, like nociceptors elsewhere, have been established as a result of some kind of injury to which during vast periods of time this region has been frequently exposed. On this premise, we should at once conclude that there are no nociceptors for heat within the abdomen because, during countless years, the intra-abdominal region never came into contact with heat. That this inference is correct is shown by the fact that the application of a thermocautery to the intestines when completing a colostomy in a conscious patient is absolutely painless. One would conclude also that there are no touch receptors in the abdominal viscera, and therefore no sense of touch in the peritoneum. Just as the larynx, the ear, the nose, the sole of the foot, and the skin have all developed the specific type of nociceptors which are adapted for their specific protective purposes, and which, when adequately stimulated, respond in a specific manner in accordance with the law of phylogenetic association, so, the abdominal viscera have developed equally specific nociceptors as a protection against specific nocuous influences.  The principal harmful influences to which the abdominal viscera have been exposed during vast periods of time are deep tearing injuries by teeth and claws in the innumerable struggles of our progenitors with each other and with their enemies (Fig. 9); peritonitis caused by perforations of the intestinal tract from ulcers, injuries, appendicitis, gall-stones, etc.; and overdistention of the hollow viscera by various forms of obstruction. Whatever may be the explanation, it is a fact that the type of trauma which results from fighting corresponds closely with that which causes the most shock in the experimental laboratory. Division of the intestines with a sharp knife causes no pain, but pulling on the mesentery elicits pain.  Ligating the stump of the appendix causes sharp, cramp-like pains.  Sharp division of the gall-bladder causes no pain, but distention, which is the gall-bladder's most common pathologic state, produces pain. Distention of the intestine causes great pain, but sharp cutting or burning causes none.  In the abdominal viscera, as in the superficial parts, nociceptors have presumably been developed by specific harmful influences and each nociceptor is open to stimulation only by a stimulus of the particular type that produced it. As a result of the excitation of nociceptors, with which pain is associated, the routine functions, such as peristalsis, secretion, and absorption are dispossessed from the control of their respective nervous mechanisms, just as they are inhibited by fear.  This hypothesis explains the loss of weight, the lassitude, the indigestion, the constipation, and the many alterations in the functions of the various glands and organs of the digestive system in chronic appendicitis. It readily explains also the extraordinary improvement in the digestive functions and the general health which follows the removal of an appendix which is so slightly altered physically that only the clinical results could persuade one that this slight change could be an adequate cause for such far-reaching and important symptoms. This hypothesis explains certain gall-bladder phenomena likewise,-- indigestion, loss of weight, disturbed functions, etc.,--and it may supply the explanation of the disturbance caused by an active anal fissure, which is a potent noci-associator, and the consequent disproportionate relief after the trivial operation for its cure. Noci-association would well explain also the great functional disturbances of the viscera which immediately follow abdominal operations. Postoperative and traumatic neuroses are at once explained on the ground of noci-association, the resulting strain from which, upon the brain-cells, causes in them physical lesions. If one were placed against a wall and were looking into the gun muzzles of a squad of soldiers, and were told that there were nine chances out of ten that he would not be killed outright when the volley was fired, would it help him to be told that he must not be afraid? Such an experience would be written indelibly on his brain. This corresponds closely to the position in which some surgical patients are placed.  In railway wrecks, we can readily understand the striking difference between the after-effects in the passengers who were conscious at the time of the accident and those who were asleep or drunk. In the latter the noci-perceptors and receptors were not aroused, hence their immunity to the nervous shock.  In the functional disturbances of the pelvic organs, association and summation may play a large role. On this hypothesis many cases of neurasthenia may well be explained. From the behavior of the individual as a whole we may well conclude that summation is but a scientific expression for "nagging." Many other pathologic phenomena may be explained in a similar manner. Thus we can understand the variations in the gastric analyses in a timid patient alarmed over his condition and afraid of the hospital. He is integrated by fear, and as fear takes precedence over all other impulses, no organ functionates normally.  For the same reason, one sees animals in captivity pine away under the dominance of fear. The exposure of a sensitive brain to the naked possibility of death from a surgical operation may be compared to uncovering a photographic plate in the bright sunlight to inspect it before putting it in the camera. This principle explains, too, the physical influence of the physician or surgeon, who, by his PERSONALITY, inspires, like a Kocher, absolute confidence in his patient.  The brain, through its power of phylogenetic association, controls many processes that have wholly escaped from the notice of the "practical man."  It is in accordance with the law of association that a flower, a word, a touch, a cool breeze, or even the thought of a fishing rod or of a gun, is helpful. On the contrary, all suggestions of despair or misfortune-- a corrugated brow, the gloomy silence of despair, or a doubtful word-- are equally depressing.  In like manner, one could add many illustrations of the symbolism that governs our daily lives. Thus we see that through the laws of inheritance and noci-association, we are able to read a new meaning into the clinical phenomena of various diseases. Observations on Patients whose Associational Centers are Dulled, and on Diseases and Injuries of Regions not Endowed with Nociceptors Reversing the order of our reasoning, let us now glance at the patient who is unconscious and who, therefore, has lost much of the power of association.  His mouth is usually dry, the digestive processes are at a low ebb, the aroma of food causes no secretion of saliva, tickling the nose causes no sneezing; he catches no cold. The laryngeal reflex is lost and food may be quietly inhaled; the entire process of metabolism is low.  The contrast between a man whose associational centers are keen and a man in whom these centers are dulled or lost is the contrast between life and death. In accordance with the law of adaptation through natural selection, phylogeny, and association, one would expect no pain in abscess of the brain, in abscess of the liver, in pylephlebitis, in infection of the hepatic vessels, in endocarditis. This law explains why there are no nociceptors for cancer, while there are active nociceptors for the acute infections. It is because nature has no helpful response to offer against cancer, while in certain of the acute pyogenic infections the nociceptors force the beneficent physiologic rest. Could we dispossess ourselves of the shackles of psychology, forget its confusing nomenclature, and view the human brain, as Sherrington has said, "as the organ of, and for the adaptation of nervous reaction," many clinical phenomena would appear in a clearer light. Natural Selection and Chemical Noci-association in the Infections Thus far we have considered the behavior of the individual as a whole in his response to a certain type of noci-influences. We have been voicing our argument in terms of physical escape from GROSS physical dangers, or of grappling with GROSS NERVE-MUSCULAR enemies of the same or of other species.  To explain these phenomena we have invoked the aid of the laws of natural selection and phylogenetic association. If our conclusions be correct, then it should follow that in the same laws we may find the explanation of immunity, which, of course, means a defensive response to our MICROSCOPIC enemies.  There should be no more difficulty in evolving an efficient army of phagocytes by natural selection, or in developing specific chemical reactions against _*microscopic enemies_, than there was in evolving the various nociceptors for our nerve-muscular defense against our _*gross enemies_. That immunity is a chemical reaction is no argument against the application of the law of natural selection or of association. What essential difference is there between the chemical defense of the skunk against its NERVE-MUSCULAR enemies and its chemical defense (immunity) against its MICROSCOPIC ENEMIES? The administration of vaccines becomes the adequate stimulus which awakens phylogenetic association of a chemical nature as a result of which immune bodies are produced. In discussing this subject I will raise only the question whether or not the specific character of the inaugural symptoms of some infectious diseases may be due to phylogenetic association. These inaugural symptoms are measurably a recapitulation of the leading phenomena of the disease in its completed clinical picture. Thus, the furious initiative symptoms of pneumonia, of peritonitis, or erysipelas, of the exanthemata, are exaggerations of phenomena which are analogous to the phenomena accompanying physical injury and fear of physical violence.  Just as the acute phenomena of fear, or those which accompany the adequate stimulation of nociceptors, are recapitulations of phylogenetic struggles, so may the inaugural symptoms of an infection be a similar phylogenetic recapitulation of the course of the disease.  A certain amount of negative evidence is supplied by a comparison of the response to a dose of toxins with the response to a dose of a standard drug. No drug in therapeutic dosage except the iodin compounds causes a febrile response; no drug causes a chill; on the other hand, all specific toxins cause febrile responses and many cause chills. If a species of animal had been poisoned by a drug during vast periods of time, and if natural selection had successfully established a self-defensive response, then the administration of that drug would cause a noci-association (chemical), and a specific reaction analogous to that following the administration of Coley's toxins might be expected. Bacterial noci-association probably operates through the same law as that through which physical noci-association operates. Natural selection is impartial, however.  It must be supposed that it acts impartially upon the microscopic invader and upon the host. On this ground one must infer that, in accordance with the same law of natural selection, the bacteria of acute infections have met by natural selection each advance in the struggle of the host for immunity.  Hence the fast and furious struggle between man and his microscopic enemies merely indicates to what extent natural selection has developed the ATTACK and the DEFENSE respectively. This struggle is analogous to the quick and decisive battles of the carnivora when fighting among themselves or when contending against their ancient enemies.  But when phylogenetically strange animals meet each other, they do not understand how to conduct a fight: natural selection has not had the opportunity of teaching them. The acute infections have the characteristics of being ancient enemies. On this hypothesis one can understand the high mortality of measles when it is introduced into a new country.  By natural selection, measles has become a powerful enemy of the human race, and a race to which this infection is newly introduced has not had the advantage of building up a defense against it by the law of natural selection. May not the phenomena of anaphylaxis be studied on associational lines? Then, too, there may be chemical noci-associations with enemies now extinct, which, like the ticklish points, may still be active on adequate stimulation.  This brief reference to the possible relation of the phenomena of the acute infections to the laws of natural selection and of specific chemical noci-association has been made as a suggestion.  Since the doctrine of evolution explains all or nothing, I have included many phenomena to see how reasonable or unreasonable such an explanation might be. Recapitulation The following are the principal points presented:  In operations under inhalation anesthesia the nerve impulses from the trauma reach every part of the brain--the cerebrum that is apparently anesthetized as well as the medulla that is known to remain awake-- the proof being the PHYSIOLOGIC exhaustion of and the PATHOLOGIC change in the nerve-cells. Under ether anesthesia the damage to the nerve-cells is at least four times greater than under nitrous oxid.  Inhalation anesthesia is, therefore, but a veneer-- a mask that "covers the deep suffering of the patient."  The cause of the exhaustion of the brain is the discharge of nervous energy in a futile effort to energize the paralyzed muscles in an attempt to escape from the injury just as if no anesthetic had been given. The exhaustion is, therefore, of the same nature as that from overexertion, but if the nerve-paths connecting the field of operation and the brain be blocked, then there is no discharge of nervous energy from the trauma, and consequently there is no exhaustion, however severe or prolonged the operation may be. Fear is a factor in many injuries and operations.  The phenomena of fear probably are exhibited only by animals whose natural defense is nerve-muscular. The skunk, the porcupine, the turtle, have little or no fear.  Fear is born of the innumerable injuries which have been inflicted in the course of evolution.  Fear, like trauma, may cause physiologic exhaustion of and morphologic changes in the brain-cells. The representation of injury, which is fear, being elicited by phylogenetic association, may be prevented by the exclusion of the noci-association or by the administration of drugs like morphin and scopolamin, which so impair the associational function of the brain-cells that immunity to fear is established. Animals whose natural defense is in muscular exertion, among which is man, may have their dischargeable nervous energy exhausted by fear alone, or by trauma alone, but most effectively by the combination of both. What is the mechanism of this discharge of energy?  It is the adequate stimulation of the nociceptors and the physiologic response for the purpose of self-preservation. According to Sherrington, the nervous system responds in action as a whole and to but one stimulus at a time. The integration of the individual as a whole occurs not alone in injury and fear, but also, though not so markedly, as a result of other phylogenetic associations, such as those of the chase and procreation. When adequate stimuli are repeated with such rapidity that the new stimulus is received before the effect of the previous one has worn off, a higher maximum effect is produced than is possible under a single stimulus, however powerful. Sexual receptors are implanted in the body by natural selection, and the adequate stimuli excite the nerve-muscular reactions of conjugation in a manner analogous to the action of the adequate stimuli of the nociceptors.  The specific response of either the sexual receptors or the nociceptors is at the expense of the total amount of nervous energy available at the moment. Likewise in daily labor, which, in the language of evolution, is the chase, nervous energy is expended.  Under the dominance of fear or injury, however, the integration is most nearly absolute and probably every expenditure of nervous energy which is not required for efforts toward self-preservation is arrested; hence fear and injury drain the cup of energy to the dregs. This is the potential difference between fear and desire, between injury and conjugation. What is the practical application of this?  In operative surgery there is introduced a new principle, which removes from surgery much of the immediate risk from its trauma by establishing ANOCI-ASSOCIATION; it places certain of the phenomena of fear on a physical basis; it explains to us the physical basis for the impairment of the entire individual under worry or misfortune; it makes evident the physical results of the daily noci-associations experienced by the individual as a social unit.  On the other hand, it explains the power of therapeutic suggestion and of other influences which serve for the time to change the noci-integration; it shows the physical basis for the difference between hope and despair; it explains some of the phenomena of Graves' disease, of sexual neurasthenia, possibly of hay-fever and of the common cold.  The principle is probably equally applicable to the acute infections, in each of which chemical noci-association gives rise to many of the phenomena of the disease and it explains their cure by natural immunity and by vaccines. This hypothesis should teach us to view our patients as a whole; and especially should it teach the surgeon gentleness.  It should teach us that there is something more in surgery than mechanics, and something more in medicine than physical diagnosis and drugs. Conclusion The brain-cells have existed for eons and, amid the vicissitudes of change, they have persisted with perhaps less alteration than has the crust of the earth.  Whether in man or in the lower animals, they are related to and obey the same general biologic laws, thus being bound to the entire past and performing their function in accordance with the law of phylogenetic association. For so long a time have we directed our attention to tumors, infections, and injuries that we have not sufficiently considered the vital force itself.  We have viewed each anatomic and pathologic part as an entity and man as an isolated phenomenon in nature. May we not find in the laws of adaptation under natural selection, and of phylogenetic association, the master key that will disclose to us the explanation of many pathologic phenomena as they have already explained many normal phenomena? And may medicine not correlate the pathologic phenomena of the sick man with the forces of evolution, as the naturalists have correlated the phenomena of the sound man, and thus may not disease, as well as health, be given its evolutionary setting? PHYLOGENETIC ASSOCIATION IN RELATION TO THE EMOTIONS[*] [*] Address before the American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia, April 22, 1911. The surgeon is familiar with the manifestations of every variety of the human emotions in the various stations of life, from infancy to senility, in health and in disease.  Not only does he come into intimate contact with the emotions displayed by the victims of disease and of accidents, but he also observes those manifested by the relatives and friends of the families of his patients. Moreover, he is unhappily forced to notice the emotional effect upon himself when he is waging an unequal battle against death-- the strain and worry at a crisis, when a life is in the balance and a single false move may be fatal, is an experience known only to the operating surgeon. For the data for this paper, therefore, in which I shall for the most part limit my discussion to the strongest of all emotions--FEAR--I have drawn largely from my personal experience as a surgeon, as well as from an experimental research in which I have had the valuable assistance of my associates, Dr. H. G. Sloan, Dr. J. B. Austin, and Dr. M. L. Menten. I believe it can be shown that it is possible to elicit the emotion of fear only in those animals that utilize a motor mechanism in defense against danger or in escape from it.  For example, the defense of the skunk is a diabolic odor which repels its enemies; the skunk has no adequate equipment for defense or escape by muscular exertion, and the skunk therefore shows little or no fear. Again, certain species of snakes are protected by venom; they possess no other means of defense nor have they adequate motor mechanisms for escape and they show no fear.  Because of their strength other animals, such as the lion, the grizzly bear, and the elephant, show but little fear (Fig. 6). Animals which have an armored protection, such as the turtle, show little fear. It is, therefore, obvious that fear is not universal and that the emotion of fear is felt only by those animals whose self-preservation is dependent upon an uncertain adequacy of their power of muscular exertion either for defense or for flight (Fig. 7). What are the principal phenomena of fear?  They are palpitation of the heart, acceleration of the rate and alteration of the rhythm of the respiration, cold sweat, rise in body temperature, tremor, pallor, erection of the hair, suspension of the principal functions of digestion, muscular relaxation, and staring of the eyes (Fig. 12). The functions of the brain are wholly suspended except those which relate to the self-protective response against the feared object. Neither the brain nor any other organ of the body can respond to any other lesser stimulus during the dominance of fear. From these premises it would appear that under the influence of fear, most, perhaps all, of the organs of the body are divided sharply into two classes:  First, those that are stimulated, and, second, those that are inhibited.  Those that are stimulated are the entire muscular system, the vasomotor and locomotor systems, the senses of perception, the respiration, the mechanism for erecting the hair, the sweat-glands, the thyroid gland, the adrenal gland (Cannon), and the special senses.  On the other hand, all the digestive and procreative functions are inhibited. What is the significance of this stimulation of some and inhibition of other organs?  As far as we know, the stimulated organs increase the efficiency of the animal for fight or for flight. It is through skeletal muscles that the physical attack or escape is effected; these muscles alone energize the claws, the teeth, the hoofs, and the means for flight.  The increased action of the muscles of the heart and the blood-vessels increases the efficiency of the circulation; the secretion of the adrenal gland causes a rise in the blood-pressure; the increased action of the thyroid gland causes an increased metabolic activity; there is evidence that glycogen is actively called out, this being the most immediately available substance for the production of energy; the increased activity of the respiration is needed to supply the greater need of oxygen and the elimination of the increased amount of waste products; the dilatation of the nostrils affords a freer intake of air; the increased activity of the sweat-glands is needed to regulate the temperature of the body which the increased metabolism causes to rise. The activity of all the organs of perception--sight, hearing, smell-- is increased in order that the danger may be more accurately perceived. It cannot be a mere coincidence that the organs and the tissues that are stimulated in the emotion of fear are precisely those that are actually utilized in a physical struggle for self-preservation. Are any other organs stimulated by fear except those that can or that do assist in making a defensive struggle?  I know of none. On the other hand, if an animal could dispense with his bulky digestive organs, whose functions are suspended by fear, if he could, so to speak, clear his decks for battle, it would be to his advantage. Although the marvelous versatility of natural selection apparently could devise no means of affording this advantage, it nevertheless shut off the nervous current and saved the vital force which is ordinarily consumed by these non-combatants in the performance of their functions. Whatever may be the origin of fear, its phenomena are due to a stimulation of all the organs and tissues that add to the efficiency of the physical struggle for self-preservation and an inhibition of the func- {illust. caption = FIG.  19--THE BROAD JUMP.  Note the similarity of the expression to the facial expression of fear and of anger (Figs. 12 and 21). (Wm. J. Brownlow, drawn from photo.) tions of the leading organs that do not participate in that struggle-- the non-combatants, so to speak.  Fear arose from injury, and is one of the oldest and surely the strongest emotion. By the slow process of vast empiricism nature has evolved the wonderful defensive motor me-chanism of many animals and of man. The stimulation of this mechanism leading to a physical struggle is action, and the stimulation of this mechanism without action is emotion. We may say, therefore, that fear is a PHYLOGENETIC FIGHT OR FLIGHT (Fig. 18). On this hypothesis all the organs and parts {illust. caption = FIG.  20.-FINISH OF RELAY RACE. Compare the facial expression of the runners with those in Figs. 12, 19, 22.  These pictures illustrate the fact that the same mechanism is stimulated in emotion as in physical action. (Photo by Underwood and Underwood, N. Y.)} of the body are integrated, connected, or correlated for the self-preservation of the individual by the activity of his motor mechanism (Figs. 12, 19, and 20). We fear not in our hearts alone, not in our brains alone, not in our viscera alone--fear influences every organ and tissue; each organ or tissue is stimulated or inhibited according to its use or hindrance in the physical struggle for existence. By thus concentrating all or most of the nerve force on the nerve-muscular mechanism for defense, a greater physical power is developed. Hence it is that under the stimulus of fear animals are able to perform preternatural feats of strength.  For the same reason, the exhaustion following fear will be increased as the powerful stimulus of fear drains the cup of nervous energy even though no visible action may result. An animal under the stimulus of fear may be likened to an automobile with the clutch thrown out but whose engine is racing at full speed. The gasoline is being consumed, the machinery is being worn, but the machine as a whole does not move, though the power of its engine may cause it to tremble. When this conception is applied to the human beings of today, certain mysterious phenomena are at once elucidated.  It must be borne in mind that man has not been presented with any new organs to meet the requirements of his present state of civilization; indeed, not only does he possess organs of the same type as those of his savage fellows, but of the same type also as those possessed by the lower animals even. In fact, man has reached his present status of civilization with the primary equipment of brutish organs.  Perhaps the most striking difference between man and animals lies in the greater control which man has gained over his primitive instinctive reactions. As compared with the entire duration of organic evolution, man came down from his arboreal abode and assumed his new role of increased domination over the physical world but a moment ago. And now, though sitting at his desk in command of the complicated machinery of civilization, when he fears a business catastrophe his fear is manifested in the terms of his ancestral physical battle in the struggle for existence.  He cannot fear intellectually, he cannot fear dispassionately, he fears with all his organs, and the same organs are stimulated and inhibited as if, instead of it being a battle of credit, of position, or of honor, it were a physical battle with teeth and claws.  Whether the cause of acute fear be moral, financial, social, or stage fright, the heart beats wildly, the respirations are accelerated, perspiration is increased, there are pallor, trembling, indigestion, dry mouth, etc. The phenomena are those which accompany physical exertion in self-defense or escape.  There is not one group of phenomena for the acute fear of the president of a bank in a financial crash and another for the hitherto trusted official who suddenly and unexpectedly faces the imminent probability of the penitentiary; or one for a patient who unexpectedly finds he has a cancer and another for the hunter when he shoots his first big game. Nature has but one means of response to fear, and whatever its cause the phenomena are always the same--always physical. If the stimulus of fear be repeated from day to day, whether in the case of a mother anxious on account of the illness of a child; a business man struggling against failure; a politician under contest for appointment; a broker in the daily hazard of his fortune; litigants in legal battle, or a jealous lover who fears a rival; the countless real as well as the baseless fears in daily life, in fact, all forms of fear, as it seems to me, express themselves in like terms of ancestral physical contests.  On this law, fear dominates the various organs and parts of the body. Anger and fear express opposite emotional states.  Fear is the expression of a strong desire to escape from danger; anger, of a strong desire to attack physically and to vanquish opposition. This hypothesis is strongly supported by the outward expressions of fear and of anger.  When the business man is conducting a struggle for existence against his rivals, and when the contest is at its height, he may clench his fists, pound the table, perhaps show his teeth, and exhibit every expression of physical combat. Fixing the jaw and showing the teeth in anger merely emphasize the remarkable tenacity of phylogeny.  Although the development of the wonderful efficiency of the hands has led to a modification of the once powerful canines of our progenitors, the ancestral use of the teeth for attack and defense is attested in the display of anger. In all stations of life differences of opinion may lead to argument and argument to physical combats, even to the point of killing. The physical violence of the savage and of the brute still lies surprisingly near the surface (Fig. 21). We have now presented some of the reasons based largely on gross animal behavior why fear is to be regarded as a response to phylogenetic association with physical danger.  In further support of this hypothesis, I shall now present some clinical and experimental evidence. Although there is not convincing proof, yet there is evidence that the effect of the stimulus of fear upon the body when unaccompanied by physical activity is more injurious than is an actual physical contest which results in fatigue without gross physical injury. It is well known that the soldier who, while under fire, waits in vain for orders to charge, suffers more than the soldier who flings himself into the fray; and that a wild animal endeavoring to avoid capture suffers less than one cowering in captivity. An unexpressed smouldering emotion is measurably relieved by action. It is probable that the various energizing substances needed in physical combat, such as the secretions of the thyroid, the adrenals (Cannon), etc., may cause physical injury to the body when they are not consumed by action (Fig. 22). That the brain is definitely influenced--damaged even-- by fear has been proved by the following experiments: Rabbits were frightened by a dog but were neither injured nor chased. After various periods of time the animals were killed and their brain-cells compared with the brain-cells of normal animals-- wide-spread changes were seen (Fig. 13). The principal clinical phenomena expressed by the rabbit were rapid heart, accelerated respiration, prostration, tremors, and a rise in temperature.  The dog showed similar phenomena, excepting that, instead of such muscular relaxation as was shown by the rabbit, it exhibited aggressive muscular action. Both the dog and the rabbit were exhausted but, although the dog exerted himself actively and the rabbit remained physically passive, the rabbit was much more exhausted. Further observations were made upon the brain of a fox which had been chased for two hours by members of a hunt club, and had been finally overtaken by the hounds and killed. Most of the brain-cells of this fox, as compared with those of a normal fox, showed extensive physical changes (Fig. 4). The next line of evidence is offered with some reservation, but it has seemed to me to be more than mere idle speculation. It relates to the phenomena of one of the most interesting diseases in the entire category of human ailments--I refer to exophthalmic goiter, or Graves' disease, a disease primarily involving the emotions. This disease is frequently the direct sequence of severe mental shock or of a long and intensely worrying strain. The following case is typical:  A broker was in his usual health up to the panic of 1907; during this panic his fortune and that of others were for almost a year in jeopardy, failure finally occurring. During this heavy strain he became increasingly nervous and by imperceptible degrees there developed a pulsating enlargement of the thyroid gland, an increased prominence of the eyes, marked increase in perspiration--profuse sweating even--palpitation of the heart, increased respiration with frequent sighing, increase in blood-pressure; there were tremor of many muscles, rapid loss of weight and strength, frequent gastro-intestinal disturbances, loss of normal control of his emotions, and marked impairment of his mental faculties. He was as completely broken in health as in fortune. These phenomena resembled closely those of fear and followed in the wake of a strain which was due to fear. In young women exophthalmic goiter often follows in the wake of a disappointment in love; in women, too, it frequently follows the illnesses of children or parents during which they have had to endure the double strain of worry and of constant care. Since such strains usually fall most heavily upon women, they are the most frequent victims of this disease.  Now, whatever the exciting cause of exophthalmic goiter, whether it be unusual business worry, disappointment in love, a tragedy, or the illness of a loved one, the symptoms are alike and closely resemble the phenomena of one of the great primitive emotions.  How could disappointment in love play a role in the causation of Graves' disease?  If the hypothesis which has been presented as an explanation of the genesis and the phenomena of fear be correct, then that hypothesis explains also the emotion of love.  If fear be a phylogenetic physical defense or escape which does not result in muscular action, then love is a phylogenetic conjugation without physical action. The quickened pulse, the leaping heart, the accelerated respiration, the sighing, the glowing eye, the crimson cheek, and many other phenomena are merely phylogenetic recapitulations of ancestral acts. The thyroid gland is believed to participate in such physical activities. Hence it may well follow that the disappointed maiden who is intensely integrated for a youth will, at every thought of him, be subjected by phylogenetic association to a specific stimulation analogous to that which attended the ancestral consummation.  Moreover, a happy marriage has many times been followed by a cure of the exophthalmic goiter which appeared in the wake of such an experience. The victims of Graves' disease present a counterpart of emotional exhaustion.  That the emotions in Graves' disease are abnormally acute is illustrated by my personal observation of the death of a subject of this disease from fear alone. Whatever the exciting cause of this disease, the symptoms are the same; just as in fear, the phenomena are the same whatever the exciting cause. Figures 12 and 16 show the resemblance between the outward appearances of a patient with Graves' disease and of a person obsessed by fear. Fear and Graves' disease have the following phenomena in common: Increased heart-beat, increased respiration, rising temperature, muscular tremors, protruding eyes, loss in weight; Cannon has found an increased amount of adrenalin in the blood in fear and Frankel in Graves' disease; increased blood-pressure; muscular weakness; digestive disturbances; impaired nervous control; hypersusceptibility to stimuli; in protracted intense fear the brain-cells show marked physical changes, and in Graves' disease analogous changes are seen (Figs. 13 C and 15). In Graves' disease there seems to be a composite picture of an intense expression of the great primitive emotions. If Graves' disease be a disease of the great primitive emotions, or rather of the whole motor mechanism, how is the constant flow of stimulation of this complicated mechanism supplied?  It would seem that there must be secreted in excessive amount some substance that activates the motor mechanism.  The nervous system in Graves' disease is hypersusceptible to stimuli and to thyroid extract. It might follow that even a normal amount of thyroid secretion would lead to excessive stimulation of the hypersusceptible motor mechanism. This condition of excessive motor activity and hyperexcitability may endure for years.  What is the source of this pathologic excitation? The following facts may give a clue.  In suitable cases of Graves' disease, if the thyroid secretion is sufficiently diminished by a removal of a part of the gland or by interrupting the nerve and the blood supply, the phenomena of the disease are diminished immediately, and in favorable cases the patient is restored to approximately the normal condition. The heart action slows, the respiratory rate falls, the restlessness diminishes, digestive disturbances disappear, tremors decrease, there is a rapid increase in the body weight, and the patient gradually resumes his normal state.  On the other hand, if for a period of time extract of the thyroid gland is administered to a normal individual in excessive dosage, there will develop nervousness, palpitation of the heart, sweating, loss of weight, slight protrusion of the eyes, indigestion; in short, most of the phenomena of Graves' disease and of the strong emotions will be produced artificially (Figs. 15 and 23). When the administration of the thyroid extract is discontinued, these phenomena may disappear.  On the other hand, when there is too little or no thyroid gland, the individual becomes dull, stupid, and emotionless, though he may be irritable; while if a sufficient amount of thyroid extract be given to such a patient he may be brought back to his normal condition. Hence we see that the phenomena of the emotions may within certain limits be increased, diminished, or abolished by increasing, diminishing, or totally excluding the secretion of the thyroid gland. Graves' disease may be increased by giving thyroid extract and by fear. It may be diminished by removing a part of the gland, or by interrupting the blood and nerve supply, or by complete rest. In addition, at some stage of Graves' disease there is an increase in the size and in the number of the secreting cells. These facts regarding the normal and the pathologic supply of thyroid secretion point to this gland as one of the sources of the energizing substance or substances, by means of which the motor phenomena of animals are executed and their emotions expressed. Anger is similar to fear in origin and, like fear, is an integration and stimulation of the motor mechanism and its accessories. Animals which have no natural weapons for attack experience neither fear nor anger, while the animals which have weapons for attack express anger principally by energizing the muscles used in attack. Although, as has already been stated, the efficiency of the hands of man has largely supplanted the use of the teeth, he still shows his teeth in anger and so gives support to the theory that this emotion is of remote ancestral origin and proves the great persistence of phylogenetic association.  On this conception we can understand why it is that a patient consumed by worry--which to me signifies interrupted stimulation, a state of alternation between hope and fear--suffers so many bodily impairments and diseases even. This hypothesis explains the slow dying of animals in captivity. It explains the grave digestive and metabolic disturbances which appear under any nerve strain, especially under the strain of fear, and the great benefits of confidence and hope; it explains the nervousness, loss of weight, indigestion--in short, the comprehensive physical changes that are wrought by fear and by sexual love and hate. On this hypothesis we can understand the physical influence of one individual over the body and personality of another; and of the infinite factors in environment that, through phylogenetic association, play a role in the functions of many of our organs. It is because under the uncompromising law of survival of the fittest we were evolved as motor beings that we do not possess any organs or faculties which have not served our progenitors in accomplishing their survival in the relentless struggle of organic forms with one another. We are now, as we were then, essentially motor beings, and the only way in which we can meet the dangers in our environment is by a motor response. Such a motor response implies the integration of our entire being for action, this integration involving the activity of certain glands, such as the adrenals (Cannon), the thyroid, the liver, etc., which throw into the blood-stream substances which help to form energy, but which, if no muscular action ensues, are harmful elements in the blood. While this motor preparation is going on, the entire digestive tract is inhibited.  It thus becomes clear why an emotion is more harmful than action. Any agency that can sufficiently inspire faith,--dispel worry,-- whether that agency be mystical, human, or divine, will at once stop the body-wide stimulations and inhibitions which cause lesions which are as truly physical as is a fracture. The striking benefits of good luck, success, and happiness; of a change of scene; of hunting and fishing; of optimistic and helpful friends, are at once explained by this hypothesis. One can also understand the difference between the broken body and spirits of an animal in captivity and its buoyant return to its normal condition when freed. But time will not permit me to follow this tempting lead, which has been introduced for another purpose--the proposal of a remedy. Worries either are or are not groundless.  Of those that have a basis, many are exaggerated.  It has occurred to me to utilize as an antidote an appeal to the same great law that originally excited the instinctive involuntary reaction known as fear-- the law of self-preservation. I have found that if an intelligent patient who is suffering from fear can be made to see so plainly as to become firmly convinced that his brain, his various organs, indeed his whole being, could be physically damaged by fear, that this same instinct of self-preservation will, to the extent of his conviction, banish fear. It is hurling a threatened active militant danger, whose injurious influences are both certain and known, against an uncertain, perhaps a fancied, one.  In other words, fear itself is an injury which when recognized is instinctively avoided.  In a similar manner anger may be softened or banished by an appeal to the stronger self-preserving instinct aroused by the fear of physical damage, such as the physical injury of brain-cells. This playing of one primitive instinct against another is comparable to the effect produced upon two men who are quarreling when a more powerful enemy of both comes threateningly on the scene. The acute fear of a surgical operation may be banished by the use of certain drugs that depress the associational power of the brain and so minimize the effect of the preparations that usually inspire fear. If, in addition, the entire field of operation is blocked by local anesthesia so that the associational centers are not awakened, the patient will pass through the operation unscathed. The phylogenetic origin of fear is injury, hence injury and fear cause the same phenomena.  In their quality and in their phenomena psychic shock and traumatic shock are the same.  The perception of danger by the special senses in the sound of the opening gun of a battle, or in the sight of a venomous snake, is phylogenetically the same and causes the same effects upon the entire body as an operation under anesthesia or a physical combat in that each drives the motor mechanism. The use of local anesthetics in the operative field prevents nerve-currents from the seat of injury from reaching the brain and there integrating the entire body for a self-defensive struggle.  The result, even though a part of the brain is asleep and the muscles paralyzed, is the same as that produced by the interception of the terrifying sound of the gun, or of the sight of the dangerous reptile, since the stimulation of the motor mechanism is prevented. By both the positive and the negative evidence we are forced to believe that the emotions are primitive instinctive reactions which represent ancestral acts; and that they therefore utilize the complicated motor mechanism which has been developed by the forces of evolution as that best adapted to fit the individual for his struggle with his environment or for procreation. The mechanism by which the motor acts are performed and the mechanism by which the emotions are expressed are one and the same. These acts in their infinite complexity are suggested by association-- phylogenetic association.  When our progenitors came in contact with any exciting element in their environment, action ensued then and there.  There was much action--little restraint or emotion. Civilized man is really in auto-captivity. He is subjected to innumerable stimulations, but custom and convention frequently prevent physical action.  When these stimulations are sufficiently strong but no action ensues, the reaction constitutes an emotion. A phylogenetic fight is anger; a phylogenetic flight is fear; a phylogenetic copulation is sexual love, and so one finds in this conception an underlying principle which may be the key to an understanding of the emotions and of certain diseases. PAIN, LAUGHTER, AND CRYING[*] [*] Address delivered before the John Ashhurst, Jr.. Surgical Society of the University of Pennsylvania, May 3, 1912. PAIN Pain, like other phenomena, was probably evolved for a particular purpose-- surely for the good of the individual; like fear and worry, it frequently is injurious.  What then may be its purpose? We postulate that pain is one of the phenomena which result from a stimulation to motor action.  When a barefoot boy steps on a sharp stone it is important that the injuring contact be released as quickly as possible; and therefore physical injury pain results and impels the required action.  Anemia of the soft parts at the points of pressure results from prolonged sitting or lying in one position, and as a result pain compels a muscular action that shifts the damaging pressure--this is the pain of anemia; when the rays of the blazing sun shine directly upon the retina, pain immediately causes a protective muscular action--the lid is closed, the head turns away--this is light pain; when standing too close to a blazing fire the excessive heat causes a pain which results in the protective muscular action of moving away--this is heat pain; when the urinary bladder is acutely overdistended the resultant pain induces voluntary as well as involuntary muscular contraction-- this is evacuation pain; associated with defecation is a characteristic warning pain, and an active pain which induces the required muscular action--this, like the pain accompanying micturition, is an evacuation pain; in obstruction of the urinary passages and of the large and the small intestine the pain is exaggerated, as is the accompanying muscular contraction--this is a pathologic evacuation pain; when the fetus reaches full term and labor is to begin, it is heralded by pain which is associated with rhythmic contractions of the uterine muscle; later, many other muscles take part in the birth and pain is associated with all these muscular contractions--these are labor pains; when a foreign body, be it ever so small, falls upon the conjunctiva or cornea there results what is perhaps the acutest pain known, and quick and active muscular action follows--this is special contact pain.  Special pain receptors are placed in certain parts of the nose, the pharynx, and the larynx, the stimulation of which causes special motor acts, such as sneezing, hawking, coughing.  Curiously vague pains are associated with the protective motor act of vomiting and with the sexual motor acts--these may be termed nausea pains and pleasure pains. We now see, therefore, that against the injurious physical contacts of environment, against heat and cold, against damaging sunlight, against local anemia when resting or sleeping, the body is protected by virtue of the muscular action which results from pain. Then, too, for the emptying of the pregnant uterus, for the evacuation of the intestine and of the urinary bladder as normal acts, and for the overcoming of obstructions in these tracts, pain compels the required muscular actions, For passing gall-stones and urinary calculi, urgent motor stimuli are awakened by pain. For each of these diversified pains the consequent muscular action is specific in type, distribution, and intensity.  This statement is so commonplace that we are apt to miss the significance and the wonder of it.  It is probable that every nerve-ending in the skin and every type of stimulation represents a separate motor pattern, the adequate stimulation of which causes always the same response. Let us pass on to the discussion of another and perhaps even more interesting type of pain, that associated with infection. Not all kinds of infection are painful; and in those infections that may be associated with pain there is pain only when certain regions of the body are involved.  Among the infections that are not associated with pain are scarlet fever, typhoid fever, measles, malaria, whooping-cough, typhus fever, and syphilis in its early stages. The infections that are usually, though not always, associated with pain are the pyogenic infections.  The pyogenic infections and the exanthemata constitute the great majority of infections and are the basis of the discussion which follows. I will state one of my principal conclusions first, _i. e_., that the only types of infection that are associated with pain are those in which the infection may be spread by muscular action or those in which the fixation of parts by continued muscular rigidity is an advantage; and, further, as a striking corollary, that the type of infection that may cause muscular action when it attacks one region of the body may cause no such action when it attacks another region. The primary, and perhaps the most striking, difference between the painless exanthemata and the painful pyogenic infections is that in the case of the exanthemata the protective response of the body is a chemical one,--the formation of antibodies in the blood, which usually produce permanent immunity,--while the response to the pyogenic infections is largely phagocytic.  In the pyogenic infections, in order to protect the remainder of the body, which, of course, enjoys no immunity, every possible barrier against the spread of the infection is thrown about the local point of infection. How are these barriers formed?  First, lymph is poured out, then the part is fixed by the continuous contraction of the neighboring muscles and by the inhibition of those muscles that, in the course of their ordinary function, would by their contractions spread the infection. Wherever there is protective muscular rigidity there is also pain. On the other hand, in pyogenic infections in the substance of the liver, in the substance of the kidney, within the brain, in the retroperitoneal space, in the lobes of the lung, in the chambers of the heart and in the blood-vessels of the chest and the abdomen, in all locations in which muscular contractions can in no way assist in localizing the disease, pyogenic infections produce no muscular rigidity and no pain.  Apparently, therefore, only those infections are painful which are associated with a protective muscular contraction. This explains why tuberculosis of the hip is painful, while tuberculosis of the lung is painless. There is a third type of pain which modifies muscular action in a curious way.  We have already stated that local pain serves an adaptive purpose.  In this light let us now consider headache. Headache is one of the commonest initiatory symptoms of the various infections, especially of those infections which are accompanied by no local pain and by no local muscular action. In peritonitis, cholecystitis, pleurisy, arthritis, appendicitis, salpingitis, child-birth, in obstructions of the intestinal and the genito-urinary tract, in short, in those acute processes in which the local symptoms are powerful enough to govern the individual as a whole,--to make him lie down and keep quiet, refuse food and possibly reject what is already in the stomach,-- in all these conditions there is rarely a headache, but in the diseases in which local pain is absent, such as the exanthemata, typhoid fever, and auto-intoxication, which have no dominating local disturbances to act as policemen to put the individual to bed and to make him refuse food that he may be in the most favorable position to combat the oncoming disease, in such cases in which these masterful and beneficent local influences are absent we postulate that headache has been evolved to perform this important service. On the hypothesis that it is good for the individual who is acutely stricken by a disease or who is poisoned by autointoxication to rest and fast, and that the muscular system obeys the imperial command of pain, and in view of the fact that the brain is not only in constant touch with the conditions of every part of the body but that it is also the controlling organ of the body, one would expect that in these diseases the major pain whose purpose it is to govern general muscular action would be located in the head and there we find it. How curious and yet how intelligible is the fact that, though a headache may be induced by even a slight auto-intoxication, an abscess may exist within the brain without causing pain. When an obliterative endarteritis is threatening a leg with anemic gangrene, or when one lies too long in the same position on a hard bed, there is threatening injury from local anemia, and as a result there is acute pain, but when the obliterative endarteritis threatens anemia of the brain, or when an embolism or thrombosis has produced anemia of the brain, there may be no accompanying pain. The probable explanation of the pain which results in the first instance and the lack of pain in the second is that in the former muscular action constitutes a self-protective response, but in the other it does not. Diseases and injuries of the brain are notoriously difficult to diagnosticate.  This may well be because it has always been so well protected by the skull that there have been evolved within it few tell-tale self-protective responses, so that in the presence of injury and disease within itself the brain remains remarkably silent. It should occasion no surprise that there are in the brain no receptors, the mechanical stimulation of which can cause pain, because its bony covering has always prevented the adaptive implantation within it of contact pain receptors.  Dr. Frazier tells me that in the course of his operations on the brains of unanesthetized patients he is able to explore the entire brain freely and without pain. From my own experience I am able to confirm Dr. Frazier's observation. In addition, the two-stage operation for the excision of the Gasserian ganglion provides an observation of extraordinary interest. If at the first seance the ganglion is exposed, but is not disturbed except by the iodoform gauze packing, then on the following day the gauze may be removed, the ganglion picked up, and its branches and root excised without anesthesia and without pain. The same statement and explanation may be made regarding the distribution of pain receptors for physical contact within the parenchyma of the liver, the gall-bladder, the abdominal viscera, the spleen, the heart, the lungs, the retroperitoneal tissue, the deep tissue of the back, the vertebrae, and in certain portions of the spinal cord. Just what is the distribution of the receptors for heat and for cold I am unable to state, but this much we do know, that without anesthesia the intestines may be cauterized freely without the least pain resulting, and in animals the cauterization of the brain causes no demonstrable change in the circulatory or respiratory reactions. It is probable therefore that the distribution of the pain receptors for physical contact and for heat are limited to those parts of the body that have been exposed to injurious contacts with environment. Of special significance is the pain which is due to cold, which increases muscular tone and produces shivering.  The general increase in muscular tone produces an interesting postural phenomenon: the limbs are flexed and the body bent forward, a position which probably is due to the fact that the flexors are stronger than the extensors. As muscular action is always accompanied by heat production, the purpose of the muscular contraction and the shivering is quite certainly caused by cold to assist in the maintenance of the normal body temperature. We have now discussed many of the causes of pain and in each instance we have found an associated muscular action which apparently serves some adaptive purpose (Figs. 24 and 25). If we assume that pain exists for the purpose of stimulating muscular reactions, we may well inquire what part of the nervous are is the site of the sensation of pain--the nerve-endings, the trunk, or the brain? Does pain result from physical contact with the nerve-endings, with the physical act of transmitting an impression along the nerve trunk, or with the process within the brain-cells by which energy is released to cause a motor act? It seems most probable that the site of the pain is in the brain-cells. If this be so, then what is the physical process by which the phenomena of pain are produced?  The one hypothesis that can be tested experimentally is that pain is a phenomenon resulting from the rapid discharge of energy in the brain-cells. If this be true, then if every pain receptor of the body were equally stimulated in such a manner that {illust. caption = FIG.  25.--FEAR AND AGONY.  "Amid this dread exuberance of woe ran naked spirits wing'd with horrid fear."-- Dante's "Inferno," Canto XXIV, lines 89, 90.  all the stimuli reached the brain-cells simultaneously, the cells would find themselves in equilibrium and no motor act would be performed. But if all the pain receptors of the body but one were equally stimulated, and this one stimu-lated harder than the rest, then the latter would gain possession of the final common path, the sensation of pain would be felt, and a muscular contraction would result. It is well known that when a greater pain is thrown into competition with a lesser one, the lesser is completely submerged. In this manner the school-boy initiates the novice into the mystery of the painless plucking of hair.  The simultaneous, but severe application of the boot to the blindfolded victim takes complete and exclusive possession of the final common path and the hair is painlessly plucked through the triumph of the boot stimulus over the hair stimulus in the struggle for the possession of the final common path.  Another argument in favor of this hypothesis that pain is an accompaniment of the release of energy in the brain- cells is found in the fact that painless stimuli received through the special senses may completely submerge the painful stimuli of physical injury; for although the stimuli to motor action, which are received through the senses of sight, hearing, and smell, cause even more powerful motor action than those caused by physical contact stimuli, yet they are not accompanied by pain. Examples of this triumph of stimulation of the special senses over contact stimulation are frequently seen in persons obsessed by anger or fear, and to a less degree in those obsessed by sexual emotion. In the fury of battle the soldier may not perceive his wound until the emotional excitation is wearing away, when the sensation of warm blood on the skin may first attract his attention. Religious fanatics are said to feel no pain when they subject themselves to self-injury. Now, since both psychic and mechanical stimuli cause motor action by the excitation ofprecisely the same mechanism in the brain, and since the more rapid release of energy from psychic stimuli submerges the physical stimuli and prevents pain, it would seem that pain must be a phenomenon which is associated with the process of releasing energy by the brain-cells. Were physical injury inflicted in a quiescent state equal to that inflicted in the emotional state, great pain and intense muscular action would be experienced. Now the emotions are as purely motor excitants as is pain. The dynamic result is the same the principal difference being the greater suddenness and the absolute specificity of the pain stimuli as compared with the more complex and less peremptory stimuli of the emotions. A further evidence that pain is a product of the release of brain-cell energy is the probability that if one could pierce the skin at many points on a limb in such a manner that antagonistic points only were equally and simultaneously stimulated, then an equilibrium in the governing brain- cells would be established and neither pain nor motion would follow.  An absolute test of this assumption cannot be made but it is supported by the obtainable evidence. We will now turn to a new viewpoint, a practical as well as a fascinating one, which can best be illustrated by two case histories: A man, seventy-eight years old, whose chief complaint was obstinate constipation, was admitted to the medical ward of the Lakeside Hospital several years ago.  The abdomen was but slightly distended; there was no fever, no increased leukocytosis, no muscular rigidity, and but slight general tenderness.  He claimed to have lost in weight and strength during the several months previous to his admission. A tentative diagnosis of malignant tumor of the large intestine was made, but free movements weresecured rather easily, and we abandoned the idea of an exploratory operation.  The patient gradually failed and died without a definite diagnosis having been made by either the medical or the surgical service.  At autopsy there was found a wide-spread peritonitis arising from a perforated appendix. A child, several years old, was taken ill with some indefinite disease. A number of the ablest medical and surgical consultants of a leading medical center thoroughly and repeatedly investigated the case. Although they could make no definite diagnosis they all agreed that the trouble surely could not be appendicitis because there was neither muscular rigidity nor tenderness. The autopsy showed a gangrenous appendix and general peritonitis. How can these apparently anomalous cases be explained? These two cases are illustrations of the same principle that underlies the freedom from pain which results from the use of narcotics and anesthetics, the same principle that explains the fact that cholecystitis may occur in the aged without any other local symptoms than the presence of a mass and perhaps very slight tenderness; and that accounts in general for the lack of well-expressed disease phenomena in senility and in infancy.  The reason why the aged, the very young, and the subjects of general paresis show but few symptoms of disease is that in senility the brain is deteriorated, while in infancy the brain is so undeveloped that the mechanism of association is inactive, hence pain and tenderness, which are among the oldest of the associations, are wanting. Senility and infancy are by nature normally narcotized. The senile are passing through the twilight into the night; while infants are traversing through the dawn into the day. Hence it is that the diagnosis of injury and disease in the extremes oflife is beset by especial difficulties, since the entire body is as silent as are the brain, the pericardium, the mediastinum, and other symptomless areas.  For the same reason, when a patient who is seriously ill with a painful disease turns upon the physician a glowing eye and an eager face, and remarks how comfortable he feels, then the end is near.  This is a brilliant and fateful clinical mirage. When one reflects on the vast amount of evidence as to the origin and the purpose of pain, he is forced to conclude that pain is a phenomenon of motor stimulation, and that its principal role is the protection of the individual against the gross and the microscopic enemies in his environment.  The benefits of pain are especially manifested in the urgent muscular actions by means of which the body moves away from physical injury; obstructions of the hollow viscera are overcome; rest is compelled in the acute infections-- the infected points are held rigidly quiet, the muscles of the abdomen are fixed, and harmful peristalsis is arrested in peritonitis; while there is absolutely no pain in the diseases or injuries which affect those regions of the body in which in the course of evolution no pain receptors were placed, or in those diseases in which muscular inhibition or contraction is of no help. In a biologic sense pain is closely associated with the emotional stimuli, for both pain and the emotions incite motor activity for the good of the individual.  The frequent occurrence of post-operative and post- traumatic pain is accounted for by the fact that the operation or the injury has lowered the threshold of the brain- cells to trauma; the brain and not the local sensitive field is the site of the pain. I have found that, by blockingthe field of operation with local anesthesia, post-operative pain is diminished; that is, since the local anesthesia prevents the strong stimuli of the trauma from reaching the brain, its threshold is not lowered. There is a close resemblance between the phenomena of pain habit, of education, of physical training, of love and of hate.  In education, in pain habit, in all emotional relations, a low brain- cell threshold is established which facilitates the reception of specific stimuli; all these processes are motor acts, or are symbolic of motor acts, and we may be trained to perceive misfortune and pain as readily as we are trained to perceive mathematical formulae or moral precepts. In each and every case, readiness of perception depends, as it seems to me, upon a modified state of the brain-cells, their threshold especially, the final degree of perception possible in any individual being perhaps based on the type of potential molecules of which the brain is built. We must believe also that every impression is permanent, as only thus could an individual animal or a man be fitted by his own experience for life's battles.  LAUGHTER AND CRYING What is laughter? What is its probable origin, its distribution, and its purpose? Laughter is an involuntary rhythmic contraction of certain respiratory muscles, usually accompanied by certain vocal sounds. It is a motor act of the respiratory apparatus primarily, although if intense it may involve not only the extraordinary muscles of respiration, but most of the muscles of the body.  There are many degrees of laughter, from the mere brightening of the eyes, a fleeting smile, tittering andgiggling, to hysteric and convulsive laughter. Under certain circumstances, laughter may be so intense and so long continued that it leads to considerable exhaustion. The formation of tears is sometimes associated with laughter. When integrated with laughter, the nervous system can perform no other function.  Crying is closely associated with laughter, and in children especially laughter and crying are readily interchanged. We postulate that laughter and weeping serve a useful purpose. According to Darwin, only man and monkeys laugh (Fig. 26); other animals exhibit certain types of facial expression accompanying various emotions, but laughter in the sense in which that word is commonly used is probably an attribute of the primates only, although it is probable that many animals find substitutes for laughter. The proneness of man to laughter is modified by age, sex, training, mental state, health, and by many other factors.  Healthy, happy children are especially prone to laughter, while disease, strong emotions, fatigue, and age diminish laughter.  Women laugh more than do men. The healthy, happy maturing young woman perhaps laughs most, especially when she is slightly embarrassed.  What causes laughter?  Good news, high spirits, tickling, hearing and seeing others laugh; droll stories; flashes of wit; passages of humor; averted injury; threatened breach of the conventions; and numerous other causes might be added. It is obvious that laughter may be produced by diverse influences, many of which are so unlike each other that it would at first sight seem improbable that a single general principle underlies all. Before presenting a hypothesis which harmonizes most of the facts, and which mayoffer an explanation of the origin and purpose of laughter, let us return for a moment to some previous considerations-- that man is essentially a motor being; that all his responses to the physical forces of his environment are motor; {illust. caption = FIG.  26.--LAUGHING CHIMPANZEE.  "Mike," the clever chimpanzee in the London Zoo, evidently enjoys a joke as well as any one else. (Photo by Underwood and Underwood, N. Y.)} that thoughts and words even are symbolic of motor acts; that in the emotions of fear, of anger, and of sexual love the whole body is integrated for acts which are not performed. These integrations stimulate the brain-cells, the ductless glands, and other parts, and the energizing secretions, among which are epinephrin, thyroid and hypophyseal secretions, are thrown into the blood-stream, while that most available fuel, glycogen, is also mobilized in the blood. This body-wide preparation for action may be designated kinetic reaction. The fact that emotion is more injurious to the body than is muscular action is well known, the difference being probably caused by the fact that when there is action the above-mentioned products of stimulation are consumed, while in stimulation without action they are not consumed and must be eliminated as waste products. Now these activating substances and the fuel glycogen may be consumed by any muscular action as well as by the particular muscular action for which the integration and consequent stimulation were made; that is, if one were provoked to such anger that he felt impelled to attack the object of his anger, one of three things might happen: First, he might perform no physical act but give expression to the emotion of anger; second, he might engage in a physical struggle and completely satisfy his anger; third, he might immediately engage in violent gymnastic exercises and thus consume all the motor-producing elements mobilized by the anger and thus clarify his body. In these premises we find our explanation of the origin and purpose of laughter and crying, for since they consist almost wholly of muscular exertion, they serve precisely such clarifying purposes as would be served by the gymnastic exercises of an angry man. As it seems to me, the muscular action of laughter clears the system of the energizing substances which have been mobilized in various parts of the body for the performance of other actions (Figs. 27 to 29). If this be true, the first question that presents itself is, Why is the respiratory system utilized for such a clarifying purpose? Why do we not laugh with our feet and hands as well? Were laughter expressed with the hands, the monkey might fall from the tree and, if by the feet, man might fall to the ground. He would at least be ataxic.  In fact, laughter has the great advantage of utilizing a group of powerful muscles which can be readily spared without seriously interfering with the maintenance of posture.  Laughter, however, is only one form of muscular action which may consume the fuel thrown into the blood by excitation. That these products of excitation are often consumed by other motor acts than laughter is frequently seen in public meetings when the stamping of feet and the clapping of hands in applause gives relief to the excitation (Fig. 30). Why the noise of laughter? In order that the products of excitation may be quickly and completely consumed, the powerful group of expiratory muscles must have some resistance against which they can exert themselves strongly and at the same time provide for adequate respiratory exchange. The intermittent closure of the epiglottis serves this purpose admirably, just as the horizontal bars afford the resistance against which muscles may be exercised.  The facial muscles are not in use for other purposes, hence their contractions will consume a little of the fuel. An audience excited by the words of an impassioned speaker undergoes a body-wide stimulation for action, all of which may be eliminated by laughter or by applause (Fig. 31). Let us test this hypothesis by some practical examples. The first is an incident that accidentally occurred in our laboratory during experiments on fear which were performed as follows: A keen, snappy fox terrier was completely muzzled by winding a broad strip of adhesive plaster around his jaw so as to include all but the nostrils. When this aggressive little terrier and the rabbit found themselves in close quarters each animal became completely governed by instinct; the rabbit crouched in fear, while the terrier, with all the ancestral assurance of seizing his prey, rushed, upon the rabbit, his muzzle always glancing off and his attack ending in awkward failure. This experiment was repeated many times and each time provoked the serious-minded scientific visitors who witnessed it to laughter.  Why?  Because the spectacle of a savage little terrier rushing upon an innocent rabbit as if to mangle it integrated the body of the onlooker with a strong desire to exert muscular action to prevent the cruelty.  This integration caused a conversion of the potential energy in the brain-cells into kinetic energy, and there resulted a discharge into the blood-stream of activating internal secretions for the purpose of producing muscular action. Instantly and unexpectedly the danger passed and the preparation for muscular action intended for use in the protection of the rabbit was not needed.  This fuel was consumed by the neutral muscular action of laughter, which thus afforded relief. A common example of the same nature is that encountered on the street when a pedestrian slips on a banana peel and, just as he is about to tumble, recovers his equilibrium.  The onlookers secure relief from the integration to run to his rescue by laughing. On the other hand, should the same pedestrian fall and fracture his skull the motor integration of the onlookers would be consumed by rendering physical assistance--hence there would be no laughter. In children almost any unexpected phenomenon, such as a sudden "booing" from behind a door, is attended by laughter, and in like manner the kinetic reaction produced by the innumerable threats of danger which are suddenly averted, a breach of the conventions, a sudden relief from acute nervous tension; a surprise--indeed, any excitant to which there is no predetermined method of giving a physical response-- may be neutralized by the excitation of the mechanism of laughter. In the same way the laughter excited by jokes may be explained. An analysis of a joke shows that it is composed of two parts-- the first, in which is presented a subject that acts as a stimulus to action, and the second, in which the story turns suddenly so that the stimulus to action is unexpectedly withdrawn. The subject matter of the joke affects each hearer according to the type of stimuli that commonly excites that individual. Hence it is that a joke may convulse one person while it bores another, and so there are jokes of the classes, bankers' jokes, politicians' jokes, the jokes of professional men, of the plebeian, of the artist, etc. If the joke fails, the integration products of the excitation may be used in physical resentment (Fig. 32). Another type of laughter is that associated with the ticklish points of certain parts of the body, the soles of the feet and certain parts of the trunk and of the abdomen.  The excitation of the ticklish receptors, like pain, compels self-defensive motor acts. This response is of phylogenetic origin, and may be awakened only by stimuli which are too light to be painful.  In this connection it is of interest to note that a superficial, insect-like contact with the skin rarely provokes laughter, and that the tickling of the nasal, oral, and pulmonary tracts does not produce laughter. The ticklish points that cause laughter are rather deeply placed, and a certain type of physical contact is required to constitute an adequate stimulus.  That is, the contact must arouse a phylogenetic association with a physical struggle or with physical exertion. In the foot, the adequate stimuli for laughter are such contacts as resemble or suggest piercing by stones or rough objects.. The intention of the one who tickles must be known; if his intention be playful, laughter results, whereas if injury be intended, then an effort toward escape or defense is excited, but no laughter. If deep tickling of the ribs is known to be malicious, it will excite physical resentment and not laughter.  Self-tickling rarely causes laughter for the reason that auto-tickling can cause only a known degree of stimulation, so that there results no excessive integration which requires relief by the neutral muscular activity of laughter. In fact, one never sees purposeful acts and laughter associated. According to its severity, an isolated stimulus causes either an action or laughter.  The ticklish points in our bodies were probably developed as a means of defense against serious attacks and of escape from injurious contacts. Anger, fear, and grief are also strong excitants and, therefore, are stimuli to motor activity.  It is obvious that whatever the excitant the physico-chemical action of the brain and the ductless glands cannot be reversed--the effect of the stimulus cannot be recalled, therefore either a purposeful muscular act or a neutralizing act must be performed or else the liberated energy must smoulder in the various parts of the body. It is on this hypothesis that the origin and the purpose of laughter and crying may be understood.  Even a superficial analysis of the phenomena of both laughter and crying show them to be without any external motor purpose; the respiratory mechanism is intermittently stimulated and inhibited; and the shoulder and arm muscles, indeed, many muscles of the trunk and the extremities are, as far as any external design is concerned, purposelessly contracted and released until the kinetic energy mobilized by excitation is utilized. During this time the facial expression gives the index to the mental state. Crying, like laughter, is always preceded by a stimulation to some motor action which may or may not be performed (Figs. 33 and 34). If a mother is anxiously watching the course of a serious illness of her child and if, in caring for it, she is stimulated to the utmost to perform motor acts, she will continue in a state of motor tenseness until the child recovers or dies. If relief is sudden, as in the crisis of pneumonia, and the mother is not exhausted, she will easily laugh if tired, she may cry. If death occurs, the stimulus to motor acts is suddenly withdrawn and she then cries aloud, and performs many motor acts as a result of the intense stimulation to motor activity which is no longer needed in the physical care of her child. With this clue we can find the explanation of many phenomena.  We can understand why laughter and crying are so frequently interchangeable; why they often blend and why either gives a sense of relief; we can understand why either laughter or crying can come only when the issue that causes the integration is determined; we can understand the extraordinary tendency to laughter that discloses the unspoken sentiments of love; we can understand the tears of the woman when she receives a proposal of marriage from the man she loves; we can understand why any averted circumstance, such as a threatened breach of the conventions, which would have led to embarrassment or humiliation, leads to a tendency to laughter; and why the recital of heroic deeds by association leads to tears, On the other hand, under the domination of acute diseases, of acute fear, or of great exhaustion, there is usually neither laughter nor crying because the nervous system is under the control of a dominating influence as a result of which the body is so exhausted that the excess of energy which alone can produce laughing or crying is lacking. A remarkable study of the modification of laughter and crying by disease is found in that most interesting of diseases--exophthalmic goiter. In this disease there is a low threshold to all stimuli. That the very motor mechanism of which we have been speaking is involved, is shown by an enormous increase in its activity. There is also an increase in the size of certain at least of the activating glands--the thyroid and the adrenals are enlarged and overactive and the glycogen-producing function of the liver is stimulated. The most striking phenomenon of this disease, however, is the remarkable lowering of the brain thresholds to stimuli.  In other words, in Graves' disease the nervous system and the activating glands-- the entire motor mechanism--are in an exalted state of activity. If this be true, then these patients should exhibit behavior precisely contrary to that of those suffering from acute infection, that is, they should be constantly clearing their systems of these superabundant energizing materials by crying or laughing, and this is precisely what happens--the flood-gates of tears are open much of the time in Graves' disease--a disease of the emotions. We have already interpreted pain as a phenomenon of motor activity. When pain does not lead to muscular activity it therefore frequently leads to crying or to moaning, just as tickling, which is equally an incentive to motor activity, results in laughter if it does not find full expression in action. From the foregoing we infer that pain, the intense motor response to tickling, and emotional excitation are all primitive biologic reactions for the good of the individual, and that all have their origin in the operation of the great laws of evolution. If to this inference we add the physiologic dictum that the nervous system always acts as a whole, and that it can respond to but one stimulus at a time, we can easily understand that while diverse causes may integrate the nervous system for a specific action, if the cause be suddenly removed, then the result of the integration of the nervous system may be, not a specific action, but an undesigned muscular action, such as crying or laughter. Hence it is that laughter and crying may be evoked by diverse exciting causes.  The intensity of the laughter or of the crying depends upon the intensity of the stimulus and the dynamic state of the individual. The linking together of these apparently widely separated phenomena by the simple law of the discharge of energy by association perhaps explains the association of an abnormal tendency to tears with an abnormally low threshold for pain (Fig. 36). In the neurasthenic, tears and pain are produced with abnormal facility.  Hence it is that, if a patient about to undergo a surgical operation is in a state of fear and dread before the operation, the threshold to all stimuli is lowered, and this lowered threshold will continue throughout the operation, even under inhalation anesthesia, because the stimulus produced by cutting sensitive tissue is transmitted to the brain just as readily as if the patient were not anesthetized.  In like manner, the brain may be sensitized by the administration of large doses of thyroid extract prior to operation, the threshold to injury in such a case continuing to be low to traumatic stimuli even under anesthesia. Under the sensitizing influences of thyroid extract or of Graves' disease the effect of an injury, of an operation, or of emotional excitation is heightened.  The extent to which the threshold to pain or to any other excitant is affected by Graves' disease is illustrated by the almost fatal reaction which I once saw result from the mere pricking with a hypodermic needle of a patient with this disease. As the result of a visit from a friend, the pulse-rate of a victim of this disease may increase twenty beats and his temperature rise markedly. I have seen the mere suggestion of an operation produce collapse. As the brain is thus remarkably sensitized in Graves' disease, we find that in these patients laughter, crying, emotional disturbances, and surgical shock are produced with remarkable facility. I hope that even this admittedly crude and imperfect consideration of this subject will suggest the possibility of establishing a practical viewpoint as to the origin and purpose of pain, of tickling, and of such expressions of emotion as laughter and crying, and that it may help us to understand their significance in health and in disease. THE RELATION BETWEEN THE PHYSICAL STATE OF THE BRAIN-CELLS AND BRAIN FUNCTIONS--EXPERIMENTAL AND CLINICAL[*] [*] Address before The American Philosophical Society, April 18, 1913. The brain in all animals (including man) is but the clearing-house for reactions to environment, for animals are essentially motor or neuromotor mechanisms, composed of many parts, it is true, but integrated by the nervous system.  Throughout the phylogenetic history of the race the stimuli of environment have driven this mechanism, whose seat of power--the battery--is the brain. Since all normal life depends upon the response of the brain to the daily stimuli, we should expect in health, as well as in disease, to find modifications of the functions and the physical state of the component parts of this central battery-- the brain-cells. Although we must believe, then, that every reaction to stimuli, however slight, produces a corresponding change in the brain-cells, yet there are certain normal, that is, non-diseased, conditions which produce especially striking changes. The cell changes due to the emotions, for example, are so similar, and in extreme conditions approach so closely to the changes produced by disease, that it is impossible to say where the normal ceases and the abnormal begins. In view of the similarity of brain-cell changes it is not strange that in the clinic as well as in daily life, we are confronted constantly by outward manifestations which are so nearly identical that the true underlying cause of the condition in any individual case is too often overlooked or misunderstood. In our laboratory experiments and in our clinical observations we have found that exhaustion produced by intense emotion, prolonged physical exertion, insomnia, intense fear, certain toxemias, hemorrhage, and the condition commonly denominated surgical shock, produce similar outward manifestations and identical brain-cell changes. It is, therefore, the purpose of this paper to present the definite results of laboratory researches which show certain relations between alterations in brain functions and physical changes in the brain-cells. Fear.--Our experiments have shown that the brain-cell changes due to fear may be divided into two stages:  First, that of hyperchromatism-- stimulation; second, that of hypochromatism--exhaustion (Figs. 5 and 13). Hyperchromatism was shown only in the presence of the activating stimuli or within a very short time after they had been received. This state gradually changed until the period of maximum exhaustion was reached--about six hours later.  Then a process of reconstruction began and continued until the normal state was again reached. Fatigue.--Fatigue from overexertion produced in the brain-cells like changes to those produced by fear, these changes being proportional to the amount of exertion (Fig. 4). In the extreme stage of exhaustion from this cause we found that the total quantity of Nissl substance was enormously reduced. When the exertion was too greatly prolonged, it took weeks or months for the cells to be restored to their normal condition. We have proved, therefore, that in exhaustion resulting from emotion or from physical work a certain number of the brain-cells are permanently lost.  This is the probable explanation of the fact that an athlete or a race-horse trained to the point of highest efficiency can reach his maximum record but once in his life. Under certain conditions, however, it is possible that, though some chromatin is forever lost, the remainder may be so remarkably developed that for a time at least it will compensate for that which is gone. Hemorrhage.--The loss of blood from any cause, if sufficient to reduce the blood-pressure, will occasion a change in the brain-cells, provided that the period of hypotension lasts for more than five minutes. This time limit is a safeguard against permanent injury from the temporary hypotension which causes one to faint. If the hemorrhage be long continued and the blood-pressure be low, there will be a permanent loss of some of the brain-cells. This explains why an individual who has suffered from a prolonged hemorrhage will never again be restored to his original powers. Drugs.--According to their effect upon the brain-cells, drugs may be divided into three classes:  First, those that stimulate the brain-cells to increased activity, as strychnin (Fig. 37); second, those that chemically destroy the brain-cells, as alcohol and iodoform (Figs. 38 and 39); third, those that suspend the functions of the cells without damaging them, as nitrous oxid, ether, morphin. Our experiments have shown that the brain-cell changes induced by drugs of the first class are precisely the same as the cycle of changes produced by the emotions and by physical activity. We have found that strychnin, according to the dosage, causes convulsions ending in exhaustion and death; excitation followed by lassitude; stimulation without notable after-results; or {illust. caption = A, Section of Cerebellum of Normal Dog.  C, Section of Cerebellum of Dog after Repeated Doses of Strychnin.  FIG.  37.-- BRAIN-CELLS SHOWING STAGE OF HYPERCHROMATISM FOLLOWED BY CHROMATOLYSIS RESULTING FROM THE CONTINUATION OF THE STIMULUS.  (Camera lucida drawings.)increased mental tone; while the brain-cells accurately display these physiologic alterations in proportional hyperchromatism in the active stages, and proportional chromatolysis in the stages of reaction.  The biologic and therapeutic application of this fact is as obvious as it is important. In our experiments, alcohol in large and repeated dosage caused marked morphologic changes in the brain-cells which went as far even as the destruction of some of the cells (Fig. 39). Ether, on the other hand, even after five hours of administration, produced no observable destructive changes in the brain-cells. The effect of iodoform was peculiarly interesting, as it was the only drug that produced a rise of temperature.  Its observed effect upon the brain-cells was that of wide-spread destruction. Infections.--In every observation regarding the effect of pyogenic infections on dogs and on man we found that they caused definite and demonstrable lesions in certain cells of the nervous system, the most marked changes being in the cortex and the cerebellum (Fig. 40). For example, in fatal infections resulting from bowel obstruction, in peritonitis, and in osteomyelitis, the real lesion is in the brain-cells. We may, therefore, reasonably conclude that the lassitude, the diminished mental power, the excitability, irritability, restlessness, delirium, and unconsciousness which may be associated with acute infections, are due to physical changes in the brain-cells. Graves' Disease.--In Graves' disease the brain-cells show marked changes which are apparently the same as those produced by overwork, by the emotions, and by strychnin.  In the postmortem examination of one advanced case it was found that a large number of brain-cells were disintegrated beyond the power of recuperation, even had the patient lived.  This is undoubtedly the reason why a severe case of exophthalmic goiter sustains a permanent loss of brain power. Insomnia.--The brains of rabbits which had been kept awake for one hundred hours showed precisely the same changes as those shown in physical fatigue, strychnin poisoning, and exhaustion from emotional stimulation.  Eight hours of continuous sleep restored all the cells except those that had been completely exhausted. This will explain the permanent ill effect of long-continued insomnia; that is, long-continued insomnia permanently destroys a part of the brain-cells just as do too great physical exertion, certain drugs, emotional strain, exophthalmic goiter, and hemorrhage. We found, however, that if, instead of natural sleep, the rabbits were placed for the same number of hours under nitrous oxid anesthesia, not only did the brain-cells recover from the physical deterioration, but that 90 per cent.  of them became hyperchromatic. This gives us a possible clue to the actual chemical effect of sleep. For since nitrous oxid owes its anesthetic effect to its influence upon oxidation, we may infer that sleep also retards the oxidation of the cell contents.  If this be true, then it is probable that inhalation anesthetics exert their peculiar influence upon that portion of the brain through which sleep itself is produced. If nitrous oxid anesthesia and sleep are chemically identical, then we have a further clue to one of the primary mechanisms of life itself; and as a practical corollary one might be able to produce artificial sleep which would closely resemble normal sleep, but which would have this advantage, that by using an anesthetic which interferes with oxidation the brain-cells might be reconstructed after physical fatigue, after emotional strain, or after the depression of disease. In the case of the rabbit in which nitrous oxid was substituted for sleep, the appearance of the brain-cells resembled that in but one other group experimentally examined--the brain-cells of hibernating woodchucks. Insanity.--Our researches have shown that in the course of a fatal disease and in fatal exhaustion, however produced, death does not ensue until there is marked disorganization of the brain tissue. In the progress of disease or exhaustion one may see in different patients every outward manifestation of mental deterioration, manifestations which, in a person who does not show any other sign of physical disease, mark him as insane.  Take, for example, the progressive mental state of a brilliant scholar suffering from typhoid fever. On the first day of the gradual onset of the disease he would notice that his mental power was below its maximum efficiency; on the second he would notice a further deterioration, and so the mental effect of his disease would progress until he would find it impossible to express a thought or to make a deduction. No one can be philanthropic with jaundice; no one suffering from Graves' disease can be generous; no mental process is possible in the course of the acute infectious diseases.  Just prior to death from any cause every one is in a mental state which, if it could be continued, would cause that individual to be judged insane. If the delirium that occurs in the course of certain diseases should be continued, the patient would be judged insane. In severe cases of Graves' disease the patient is insane. Individuals under overwhelming emotion may be temporarily insane. Every clinician has seen great numbers of cases in which insanity is a phase of a disease, of an injury, or of an emotion. The stage of excitation in anesthesia is insanity. The only difference between what is conventionally called insanity and the fleeting insanity of the sick and the injured is that of time. We may conclude, therefore, what must be the brain-picture of the person who is permanently insane.  This _a priori_ reasoning is all that is possible, since the study of the brain in the insane has thus far been confined to the brains of those who have died of some disease. And it is impossible to say which changes have been produced by the fatal disease, and which by the condition which produced the insanity. The only logical way by which to investigate the physical basis of insanity would be to make use of the very rare opportunities of studying the brains of insane persons who have died in accidents. Our experiments have proved conclusively that whether we call a person fatigued or diseased, the brain-cells undergo physical deterioration, accompanied by loss of mental power (Figs. 40 to 43). Even to the minutest detail we can show a direct relationship between the physical state of the brain-cells and the mental power of the individual, that is, the physical power of a person goes _pari passu_ with his mental power. Indeed, it is impossible to conceive how any mental action, however subtle, can occur without a corresponding change in the brain-cells. It is possible now to measure only the evidences of the effects on the brain-cells of gross and violent mental activity. At some future time it will doubtless be possible so to refine the technic of brain-cell examinations that more subtle changes may be measured.  Nevertheless, with the means at our disposal we have shown already that in all the conditions which we have studied the cells of the cortex show the greatest changes, and that loss of the higher mental functions invariably accompanies the cell deterioration. A MECHANISTIC VIEW OF PSYCHOLOGY[*] [*] Address delivered before Sigma Xi, Case School of Science, Cleveland, Ohio, May 27, 1913, and published in _Science_, August 29, 1913. Traditional religion, traditional medicine, and traditional psychology have insisted upon the existence in man of a triune nature. Three "ologies" have been developed for the study of each nature as a separate entity--body, soul, and spirit--physiology, psychology, theology; physician, psychologist, priest.  To the great minds of each class, from the days of Aristotle and Hippocrates on, there have come glimmerings of the truth that the phenomena studied under these divisions were interrelated.  Always, however, the conflict between votaries of these sciences has been sharp, and the boundary lines between them have been constantly changing. Since the great discoveries of Darwin, the zoologist, biologist, and physiologist have joined hands, but still the soul-body-spirit chaos has remained.  The physician has endeavored to fight the gross maladies which have been the result of disordered conduct; the psychologist has reasoned and experimented to find the laws governing conduct; and the priest has endeavored by appeals to an unknown god to reform conduct. The great impulse to a deeper and keener study of man's relation, not only to man, but to the whole animal creation, which was given by Darwin, has opened the way to the study of man on a different basis. Psychologists, physicians, and priests are now joining hands as never before in the great world-wide movement for the betterment of man. The new science of sociology is combining the functions of all three, for priest, physician, and psychologist have come to see that man is in large measure the product of his environment. My thesis to-night, however, will go beyond this common agreement, for I shall maintain, not that man is in _*large measure_ the product of his environment, but that environment has been the actual CREATOR of man; that the old division between body, soul, and spirit is non-existent; that man is a unified mechanism responding in every part to the adequate stimuli given it from without by the environment of the present and from within by the environment of the past, the record of which is stored in part in cells throughout the mechanism, but especially in its central battery--the brain. I postulate further that the human body mechanism is equipped, first, for such conflict with environment as will tend to the preservation of the individual; and, second, for the propagation of the species, both of these functions when most efficiently carried out tending to the upbuilding and perfection of the race. Through the long ages of evolution the human mechanism has been slowly developed by the constant changes and growth of its parts which have resulted from its continual adaptation to its environment. In some animals the protection from too rough contact with surroundings was secured by the development of an outside armor; in others noxious secretions served the purposes of defense, but such devices as these were not suitable for the higher animals nor for the diverse and important functions of the human race. The safety of the higher animals and of man had to be preserved by some mechanism by means of which they could become adapted to a much wider and more complex environment, the dominance over which alone gives them their right to be called "superior beings." The mechanism by the progressive development of which living beings have been able to react more and more effectually to their environment is the central nervous system, which is seen in one of its simplest forms in motor plants, such as the sensitive plant and the Venus fly-trap, and in its highest development only in the sanest, healthiest, happiest, and most useful men. The essential function of the nervous system was primarily to secure some form of motor activity, first as a means of securing food, and later as a means of escaping from enemies and to promote procreation. Activities for the preservation of the individual and of the species were and are the only purposes for which the body energy is expended. The central nervous system hag accordingly been developed for the purpose of securing such motor activities as will best adapt the individuals of a species for their self-preservative conflict with environment. It is easy to appreciate that the simplest expressions of nerve response-- the reflexes--are motor in character, but it is difficult to understand how such intangible reactions as love, hate, poetic fancy, or moral inhibition can be also the result of the adaptation to environment of a distinctively motor mechanism.  We expect, however, to prove that so-called "psychic" states as well as the reflexes are products of adaptation; that they occur automatically in response to adequate stimuli in the environment; that, like the reflexes, they are expressions of motor activity, which, although intangible and unseen, in turn incite to activity the units of the motor mechanism of the body; and finally, that any "psychic" condition results in a definite depletion of the potential energy in the brain-cells which is proportionate to the muscular exertion of which it is the representative. That this nerve mechanism may effectively carry out its twofold function, first, of self-adaptation to meet adequately the increasingly complicated stimuli of environment; and second, of adapting the motor mechanism to respond adequately to its demands, there have been implanted in the body numerous nerve ceptors-- some for the transmission of stimuli harmful to the mechanism-- nociceptors some of a beneficial character--beneceptors; and still others more highly specialized, which partake of the nature of both bene- and nociceptors--the distance ceptors, or special senses. A convincing proof that environment has been the creator of man is seen in the absolute adaptation of the nociceptors as manifested in their specific response to adequate stimuli, and in their presence in only those parts of the body which throughout the history of the race have been most exposed to harmful contacts. We find they are most numerous in the face, the neck, the abdomen, the hands, and the feet; while in the back they are few in number, and within the bony cavities they are lacking. Instances of the specific responses made by the nociceptors might be multiplied indefinitely.  Sneezing, for example, is a specific response made by the motor mechanism to stimulation of nociceptors in the nose, while stimulation of the larynx does not produce a sneeze, but a cough; stimulation of the nociceptors of the stomach does not produce cough, but vomiting; stimulation of the nociceptors of the intestine does not produce vomiting, but increased peristaltic action. There are no nociceptors misplaced; none wasted; none that do not make an adequate response to adequate stimulation. Another most significant proof that the environment of the past has been the creator of the man of to-day is seen in the fact that man has added to his environment certain factors to which adaptation has not as yet been made.  For example, heat is a stimulus which has existed since the days of prehistoric man, while the _x_-ray is a discovery of to-day; to heat, the nociceptors produce an adequate response; to the _x_-ray there is no response. There was no weapon in the prehistoric ages which could move at the speed of a bullet from the modern rifle, therefore, while slow penetration of the tissues produces great pain and muscular response, there is no response to the swiftly moving bullet. The response to contact stimuli then depends always on the presence of nociceptors in the affected part of the body and to the type of the contact.  Powerful response is made to crushing injury by environmental forces; to such injuring contacts as resemble the impacts of fighting; to such tearing injuries as resemble those made by teeth and claws (Fig. 9). On the other hand, the sharp division of tissue by cutting produces no adaptive response; indeed, one might imagine that the body could be cut to pieces by a superlatively sharp knife applied at tremendous speed without material adaptive response. These examples indicate how the history of the phylogenetic experiences of the human race may be learned by a study of the position and the action of the nociceptors, just as truly as the study of the arrangement and variations in the strata of the earth's crust discloses to us geologic history. These adaptive responses to stimuli are the result of the action of the brain-cells, which are thus continually played upon by the stimuli of environment.  The energy stored in the brain-cells in turn activates the various organs and parts of the body. If the environmental impacts are repeated with such frequency that the brain-cells have no time for restoration between them, the energy of the cells becomes exhausted and a condition of shock results. Every action of the body may thus be analyzed into a stimulation of ceptors, a consequent discharge of brain-cell energy, and a final adaptive activation of the appropriate part. Walking, running, and their modifications constitute an adaptation of wonderful perfection, for, as Sherrington has shown, the adaptation of locomotion consists of a series of reflexes-- ceptors in the joints, in the limb, and in the foot being stimulated by variations in pressure. As we have shown, the bene- and nociceptors orientate man to all forms of physical contact--the former GUIDE HIM TO the acquisition of food and to sexual contact; the latter DIRECT HIM FROM contacts of a harmful nature.  The distance ceptors, on the other hand, adapt man to his distant environment by means of communication through unseen forces--ethereal vibrations produce sight; air waves produce sound; microscopic particles of matter produce smell. The advantage of the distance ceptors is that they allow time for orientation, and because of this great advantage the majority of man's actions are responses to their adequate stimuli. As Sherrington has stated, the greater part of the brain has been developed by means of stimuli received through the special senses, especially through the light ceptors, the optic nerves. We have just stated that by means of the distance ceptors animals and man orientate themselves to their distant environment. As a result of the stimulation of the special senses chase and escape are effected, fight is conducted, food is secured, and mates are found. It is obvious, therefore, that the distance ceptors are the primary cause of continuous and exhausting expenditures of energy. On the other hand, stimuli applied to contact ceptors lead to short, quick discharges of nervous energy.  The child puts his hand in the fire and there is an immediate and complete response to the injuring contact; he sees a pot of jam on the pantry shelf and a long train of continued activities are set in motion, leading to the acquisition of the desired object. The contact ceptors do not at all promote the expenditure of energy in the chase or in fight, in the search for food or for mates. Since the distance ceptors control these activities, one would expect to find that they control also those organs whose function is the production of energizing internal secretions.  Over these organs--the thyroid, the adrenals, the hypophysis--the contact ceptors have no control. Prolonged laboratory experimentation seems to prove this postulate. According to our observations, no amount of physical trauma inflicted upon animals will cause hyperthyroidism or increased adrenalin in the blood, while fear and rage do produce hyperthyroidism and increased adrenalin (Fig. 44) (Cannon). This is a statement of far-reaching importance and is the key to an explanation of many chronic diseases-- diseases which are associated with the intense stimulation of the distance ceptors in human relations. Stimuli of the contact ceptors differ from stimuli of the distance ceptors in still another important particular.  The adequacy of stimuli of the contact ceptors depends upon their number and intensity, while the adequacy of the stimuli of the distance ceptors depends upon the EXPERIENCE of the species and of the individual. That is, according to phylogeny and ontogeny this or that sound, this or that smell, this or that sight, through association recapitulates the experience of the species and of the individual-- awakens the phylogenetic and ontogenetic memory.  In other words, sights, sounds, and odors are symbols which awaken phylogenetic association. If a species has become adapted to make a specific response to a certain object, then that response will occur automatically in an individual of that species when he hears, sees, or smells that object. Suppose, for example, that the shadow of a hawk were to fall simultaneously on the eyes of a bird, a rabbit, a cow, and a boy. That shadow would at once activate the rabbit and the bird to an endeavor to escape, each in a specific manner according to its phylogenetic adaptation; the cow would be indifferent and neutral; while the boy, according to his personal experience or ontogeny, might remain neutral, might watch the flight of the hawk with interest or might try to shoot it. Each phylogenetic and each ontogenetic experience by an indirect method develops its own mechanism of adaptation in the brain; and the brain threshold is raised or lowered to stimuli by the strength and frequency of repetition of the experience. Thus through the innumerable symbols supplied by environment the distance ceptors drive this or that animal according to the type of brain pattern and the particular state of threshold which has been developed in that animal by its phylogenetic and ontogenetic experiences. The brain pattern depends upon his phylogeny, the state of threshold upon his ontogeny.  Each BRAIN PATTERN is created by some particular element in the environment to which an adaptation has been made for the good of the species.  The _*state of threshold_ depends upon the effect made upon the individual by his personal contacts with that particular element in his environment.  The presence of that element produces in the individual an associative recall of the adaptation of his species--that is, the brain pattern developed by his phylogeny becomes energized to make a specific response. The intensity of the response depends upon the state of threshold-- that is, upon the associative recall of the individual's own experience--his ontogeny. If the full history of the species and of the individual could be known in every detail, then every detail of that individual's conduct in health and disease could be predicted. Reaction to environment is the basis of conduct, of moral standards, of manners and conventions, of work and play, of love and hate, of protection and murder, of governing and being governed, in fact, of all the reactions between human beings--of the entire web of life. To quote Sherrington once more:  "Environment drives the brain, the brain drives the various organs of the body." By what means are these adaptations made?  What is the mechanism through which adequate responses are made to the stimuli received by the ceptors? We postulate that in the brain there are innumerable patterns each the mechanism for the performance of a single kind of action, and that the brain-cells supply the energy--electric or otherwise-- by which the act is performed; that the energy stored in the brain-cells is in some unknown manner released by the force which activates the brain pattern; and that through an unknown property of these brain patterns each stimulus causes such a change that the next stimulus of the same kind passes with greater facility. Each separate motor action presumably has its own mechanism-- brain pattern--which is activated by but one ceptor and by that ceptor only when physical force of a certain intensity and rate of motion is applied.  This is true both of the visible contacts affecting the nociceptors and of the invisible contacts by those intangible forces which affect the distance ceptors. For example, each variation in speed of the light-producing waves of ether causes a specific reaction in the brain. For one speed of ether waves the reaction is the perception of the color blue; for another, yellow; for another, violet. Changes in the speed of air waves meet with specific response in the brain patterns tuned to receive impressions through the aural nerves, and so we distinguish differences in sound pitch. If we can realize the infinite delicacy of the mechanisms adapted to these infinitesimal variations in the speed and intensity of invisible and intangible stimuli, it will not be difficult to conceive the variations of brain patterns which render possible the specific responses to the coarser contacts of visible environment. Each brain pattern is adapted for but one type of motion, and so the specific stimuli of the innumerable ceptors play each upon its own brain pattern only.  In addition, each brain pattern can react to stimuli applied only within certain limits. Too bright a light blinds; too loud a sound deafens.  No mechanism is adapted for waves of light above or below a certain rate of speed, although this range varies in different individuals and in different species according to the training of the individual and the need of the species. We have already referred to the fact that there is no receptive mechanism adapted to the stimuli from the _x_-ray, from the high-speed bullet, from electricity.  So, too, there are innumerable forces in nature which can excite in man no adaptive response, since there exist in man no brain patterns tuned to their waves, as in the case of certain ethereal and radioactive forces. On this mechanistic basis the emotions may be explained as activations of the entire motor mechanism for fighting, for escaping, for copulating. The sight of an enemy stimulates in the brain those patterns formed by the previous experiences of the individual with that enemy, and also the experiences of the race whenever an enemy had to be met and overcome. Each of these many brain patterns in turn activates that part of the body through which lies the path of its own adaptive response-- those parts including the special energizing or activating organs. Laboratory experiments show that in an animal driven strongly by emotion the following changes may be seen:  (1) A mobilization of the energy-giving compound in the brain-cells, evidenced by a primary increase of the Nissl substance and a later disappearance of this substance and the deterioration of the cells (Figs. 5 and 13); (2) increased output of adrenalin (Cannon), of thyroid secretion, of glycogen, and an increase of the power of oxidation in the muscles; (3) accelerated circulation and respiration with increased body temperature; (4) altered metabolism.  All these are adaptations to increase the motor efficiency of the mechanism.  In addition, we find an inhibition of the functions of every organ and tissue that consumes energy, but does not contribute directly to motor efficiency. The mouth becomes dry; the gastric and pancreatic secretions are lessened or are completely inhibited; peristaltic action stops. The obvious purpose of all these activations and inhibitions is to mass every atom of energy upon the muscles that are conducting the defense or attack. So strong is the influence of phylogenetic experience that though an enemy to-day may not be met by actual physical attack, yet the decks are cleared for action, as it were, and the weapons made ready, the body as a result being shaken and exhausted. The type of emotion is plainly declared by the activation of the muscles which would be used if the appropriate physical action were consummated.  In anger the teeth are set, the fists are clenched, the posture is rigid; in fear the muscles collapse, the joints tremble, and the running mechanism is activated for flight; in sexual excitement the mimicry is as obvious. The emotions, then, are the preparations for phylogenetic activities. If the activities are consummated, the fuel--glycogen--and the activating secretions from the thyroid, the adrenals, the hypophysis are consumed. In the activation without action, these products must be eliminated as waste products and so a heavy strain is put upon the organs of elimination.  It is obvious that the body under emotion might be clarified by active muscular exercise, but the subject of the emotion is so strongly integrated thereby that it is difficult for him to engage in diverting, clarifying exertion.  The person in anger does not want to be saved from the ill effects of his own emotion; he wants only to fight; the person in fear wants only to escape; the person under sexual excitement wants only possession. All the lesser emotions--worry, jealousy, envy, grief, disappointment, expectation--all these influence the body in this manner, the consequences depending upon the intensity of the emotion and its protraction. Chronic emotional stimulation, therefore, may fatigue or exhaust the brain and may cause cardiovascular disease, indigestion, Graves' disease, diabetes, and insanity even. The effect of the emotions upon the body mechanism may be compared to that produced upon the mechanism of an automobile if its engines are kept running at full speed while the machine is stationary. The whole machine will be shaken and weakened, the batteries and weakest parts being the first to become impaired and destroyed, the length of usefulness of the automobile being correspondingly limited. We have shown that the effects upon the body mechanism of the action of the various ceptors is in relation to the response made by the brain to the stimuli received.  What is this power of response on the part of the brain but CONSCIOUSNESS?  If this is so, then consciousness itself is a reaction to environment, and its intensity must vary with the state of the brain and with the environmental stimuli. If the brain-cells are in the state of highest efficiency, if their energy has not been drawn upon, then consciousness is at its height; if the brain is fatigued, that is, if the energy stored in the cells has been exhausted to any degree, then the intensity of consciousness is diminished.  So degrees of consciousness vary from the height maintained by cells in full vigor through the stages of fatigue to sleep, to the deeper unconsciousness secured by the administration of inhalation anesthetics, to that complete unconsciousness of the environment which is secured by blocking the advent to the brain of all impressions from both distance and contact ceptors, by the use of both local and inhalation anesthetics--the state of anoci-association (Fig. 14). Animals and man may be so exhausted as to be only semi-conscious. While a brain perfectly refreshed by a long sleep cannot immediately sleep again, the exhausted brain and the refreshed brain when subjected to equal stimuli will rise to unequal heights of consciousness. The nature of the physical basis of consciousness has been sought in experiments on rabbits which were kept awake from one hundred to one hundred and nine hours.  At the end of this time they were in a state of extreme exhaustion and seemed semi-conscious. If the wakefulness had been further prolonged, this state of semi-consciousness would have steadily changed until it culminated in the permanent unconsciousness of death. An examination of the brain-cells of these animals showed physical changes identical with those produced by exhaustion from other causes, such as prolonged physical exertion or emotional strain (Figs. 45 and 46). After one hundred hours of wakefulness the rabbits were allowed a long period of sleep.  All the brain-cells were restored except those that had been in a state of complete exhaustion. A single seance of sleep served to restore some of the cells, but those which had undergone extreme changes required prolonged rest. These experiments give us a definite physical basis for explaining the cost to the body mechanism of maintaining the conscious state. We have stated that the brain-cell changes produced by prolonged consciousness are identical with those produced by physical exertion and by emotional strain.  Rest, then, and especially sleep, is needed to restore the physical state of the brain-cells which have been impaired, and as the brain-cells constitute the central battery of the body mechanism, their restoration is essential for the maintenance of normal vitality. In ordinary parlance, by consciousness we mean the activity of that part of the brain in which associative memory resides, but while associative memory is suspended the activities of the brain as a whole are by no means suspended; the respiratory and circulatory centers are active, as are those centers which maintain muscular tone. This is shown by the muscular response to external stimuli made by the normal person in sleep; by the occasional activation of motor patterns which may break through into consciousness causing dreams; and finally by the responses of the motor mechanism made to the injuring stimuli of an operation on a patient under inhalation anesthesia only. Direct proof of the mechanistic action of many of life's phenomena is lacking, but the proof is definite and final of the part that the brain-cells play in maintaining consciousness; of the fact that the degree of consciousness and mental efficiency depends upon the physical state of the brain-cells; and finally that efficiency may be restored by sleep, provided that exhaustion of the cells has not progressed too far. In this greatest phenomenon of life, then, the mechanistic theory is in harmony with the facts. Perhaps no more convincing proof of our thesis that the body is a mechanism developed and adapted to its purposes by environment can be secured than by a study of that most constant manifestation of consciousness--pain. Like the other phenomena of life, pain was undoubtedly evolved for a particular purpose--surely for the good of the individual. Like fear and worry, it frequently is injurious.  What then may be its purpose? We postulate that pain is a result of contact ceptor stimulation for the purpose of securing protective muscular activity. This postulate applies to all kinds of pain, whatever their cause-- whether physical injury, pyogenic infection, the obstruction of hollow viscera, childbirth, etc. All forms of pain are associated with muscular action, and as in every other stimulation of the ceptors, each kind of pain is specific to the causative stimuli.  The child puts his hand in the fire; physical injury pain results, and the appropriate muscular response is elicited.  If pressure is prolonged on some parts of the body, anemia of the parts may result, with a corresponding discomfort or pain, requiring muscular action for relief. When the rays of the sun strike directly upon the retina, light pain causes an immediate protective action, so too in the evacuation of the intestine and the urinary bladder as normal acts, and in overcoming obstruction of these tracts, discomfort or pain compel the required muscular actions.  This view of pain as a stimulation to motor action explains why only certain types of infection are associated with pain; namely, those types in which the infection may be spread by muscular action or those in which the fixation of parts by continued muscular rigidity is an advantage. As a further remarkable proof of the marvelous adaptation of the body mechanism to meet varying environmental conditions, we find that just as nociceptors have been implanted in only those parts of the body which have been subject to nocuous contacts, so a type of infection which causes muscular action in one part of the body may cause none when it attacks another. This postulate gives us the key to the pain-muscular phenomena of peritonitis, pleurisy, cystitis, cholecystitis, etc., as well as to the pain-muscular phenomena in obstructions of the hollow viscera. If pain is a part of a muscular response and occurs only as a result of contact ceptor stimulation by physical injury, infection, anemia, or obstruction, we may well inquire which part of the nerve mechanism is the site of the phenomenon of pain. Is it the nerve-ending, the nerve-trunk, or the brain?  That is, is pain associated with the physical contact with the nerve-ending, or with the physical act of transmission along the nerve-trunk, or with the change of brain-cell substance by means of which the motor-producing energy is released? We postulate that the pain is associated with the discharge of energy from the brain-cells. If this be true, then if every nociceptor in the body were equally stimulated in such a manner that all the stimuli should reach the brain-cells simultaneously, then the cells would find themselves in equilibrium and no motor act would be performed. But if all the pain nerve ceptors but one were equally stimulated, and this one more strongly stimulated than the rest, then this one would gain possession of the final common path--would cause a muscular action and the sensation of pain. It is well known that when a greater pain or stimulus is thrown into competition with a lesser one, the lesser is submerged. Of this fact the school-boy makes use when he initiates the novice into the mystery of the painless pulling of hair. The simultaneous but severe application of the boot to the blindfolded victim takes complete but exclusive possession of the final common path and the hair is painlessly plucked as a result of the triumph of the boot stimulus over the pull on the hair in the struggle for the final common path. Persons who have survived a sudden, complete exposure to superheated steam, or whose bodies have been enwrapped in flame, testify that they have felt no pain.  As this absence of pain may be due to the fact that the emotion of fear gained the final common path, to the exclusion of all other stimuli, we are trying by experimentation to discover the effects of simultaneous painful stimulation of all parts of the body. The data already in hand, and the experiments now in progress, in which anesthetized animals are subjected to powerful stimuli applied to certain parts of the body only, or simultaneously to all parts of the body, lead us to believe that in the former case the brain-cells become stimulated or hyperchromatic, while in the latter case no brain-cell changes occur.  We believe that our experiments will prove that an equal and simultaneous stimulation of all parts of the body leaves the brain-cells in a state of equilibrium. Our theory of pain will then be well sustained, not only by common observation, but by experimental proof, and so the mechanistic view will be found in complete harmony with another important reaction. We have stated that when a number of contact stimuli act simultaneously, the strongest stimulus will gain possession of the final common path-- the path of action.  When, however, stimuli of the distance ceptors compete with stimuli of the contact ceptors, the contact-ceptor stimuli often secure the common path, not because they are stronger or more important, but because they are immediate and urgent. In many instances, however, the distance-ceptor stimuli are strong, have the advantage of a lowered threshold, and therefore compete successfully with the immediate and present stimuli of the contact ceptors.  In such cases we have the interesting phenomenon of physical injury without resultant pain or muscular response. The distance-ceptor stimuli which may thus triumph over even powerful contact-ceptor stimuli are those causing strong emotions--as great anger in fighting; great fear in a battle; intense sexual excitement. Dr. Livingstone has testified to his complete unconsciousness to pain during his struggle with a lion; although he was torn by teeth and claws, his fear overcame all other impressions. By frequently repeated stimulation the Dervish secures a low threshold to the emotions caused by the thought of God or the devil, and his emotional excitement is increased by the presence of others under the same stimulation; emotion, therefore, secures the final common path and he is unconscious of pain when he lashes, cuts, and bruises his body.  The phenomena of hysteria may be explained on this basis, as may the unconsciousness of passing events in a person in the midst of a great and overwhelming grief. By constant practice the student may secure the final common path for such impressions as are derived from the stimuli offered by the subject of his study, and so he will be oblivious of his surroundings. Concentration is but another name for a final common path secured by the repetition and summation of certain stimuli. If our premises are sustained, then we can recognize in man no will, no ego, no possibility for spontaneous action, for every action must be a response to the stimuli of contact or distance ceptors, or to their recall through associative memory.  Memory is awakened by symbols which represent any of the objects or forces associated with the act recalled. Spoken and written words, pictures, sounds, may stimulate the brain patterns formed by previous stimulation of the distance ceptors; while touch, pain, temperature, pressure, may recall previous contact-ceptor stimuli.  Memory depends in part upon the adequacy of the symbol, and in part upon the state of the threshold. If one has ever been attacked by a snake, the threshold to any symbol which could recall that attack would be low; the later recall of anything associated with the bite or its results would produce in memory a recapitulation of the whole scene, while even harmless snakes would thereafter be greeted with a shudder. On the other hand, in a child the threshold is low to the desire for the possession of any new and strange object; in a child, therefore, to whom a snake is merely an unusual and fascinating object, there is aroused only curiosity and the desire for the possession of a new plaything. If we are to attribute to man the possession of a governing attribute not possessed by other parts of the animal creation, where are we to draw the boundary line, and say "here the ego-- the will--the reason--emerges"? What attribute, after all, has man which in its ultimate analysis is not possessed by the lowest animals or by the vegetable creation, even?  From the ameba, on through all the stages of animal existence, every action is but a response to an adequate stimulus; and as a result of adequate stimuli each step has been taken toward the higher and more intricate mechanisms which play the higher and more intricate parts in the great scheme of nature. The Venus fly-trap responds to as delicate a stimulus as do any of the contact ceptors of animals, and the motor activity resulting from the stimulus is as complex.  To an insect-like touch the plant responds; to a rough contact there is no response; that is, the motor mechanism of the plant has become attuned to only such stimuli as simulate the contact of those insects which form its diet. It catches flies, eats and digests them, and ejects the refuse (Fig. 47). The ameba does no less.  The frog does no more, excepting that in its place in creation a few more reactions are required for its sustenance and for the propagation of its species. Man does no more, excepting that in man's manifold relations there are innumerable stimuli, for meeting which adequately, innumerable mechanisms have been evolved.  The motor mechanism of the fly-trap is perfectly adapted to its purpose. The motor mechanism of man is adapted to its manifold uses, and as new environmental influences surround him, we must believe that new adaptations of the mechanism will be evolved to meet the new conditions. Is not this conception of man's activities infinitely more wonderful, and infinitely more comprehensible than is the conception that his activities may be accounted for by the existence of an unknown, unimaginable, and intangible force called "mind" or "soul"? We have already shown how the nerve mechanism is so well adapted to the innumerable stimuli of environment that it can accurately transmit and distinguish between the infinite variations of speed in the ether waves producing light, and the air waves producing sound. Each rate of vibration energizes only the mechanism which has been attuned to it.  With marvelous accuracy the light and sound waves gain access to the nerve tissue and are finally interpreted in terms of motor responses, each by the brain pattern attuned to that particular speed and intensity.  So stimuli and resultant actions multiplied by the total number of the motor patterns in the brain of man give us the sum total of his life's activities-- they constitute his life. As in evolutionary history the permanence of an adaptation of the body mechanism depends upon its value in the preservation of the life of the individual and upon its power to increase the value of the individual to the race, so the importance and truth of these postulates and theories may well be judged on the same basis. The fundamental instincts of all living matter are self-preservation and the propagation of the species.  The instinct for self-preservation causes a plant to turn away from cold and damaging winds toward the life-giving sun; the inert mussel to withdraw within its shell; the insect to take flight; the animal to fight or to flee; and man to procure food that he may oppose starvation, to shelter himself and to provide clothes that he may avoid the dangers of excessive cold and heat, to combat death from disease by seeking medical aid, to avoid destruction by man or brute by fight or by flight. The instinct to propagate the species leads brute man by crude methods, and cultured man by methods more refined, to put out of his way sex rivals so that his own life may be continued through offspring. The life of the species is further assured by the protective action exercised over the young by the adults of the species. As soon as the youngest offspring is able successfully to carry on his own struggle with environment there is no longer need for the parent, and the parent enters therefore the stage of disintegration. The average length of life in any species is the sum of the years of immaturity, plus the years of female fertility, plus the adolescent years of the offspring. The stimuli resulting from these two dominant instincts are now so overpowering as compared with all other environmental stimuli that the mere possession of adequate knowledge of the damaging effects of certain actions as compared with the saving effects of others will (other things being equal) lead the individual to choose the right,-- the self- and species-preservative course of action, instead of the wrong,-- the self- and species-destructive course of action. The dissemination of the knowledge of the far-reaching deleterious effects of protracted emotional strain, of overwork, and of worry will automatically raise man's threshold to the damaging activating stimuli causing the strong emotions, and will cause him to avoid dangerous strains of every kind. The individual thus protected will therefore rise to a plane of poise and efficiency far above that of his uncontrolled fellows, and by so much will his efficiency, health, and happiness be augmented. A full acceptance of this theory cannot fail to produce in those in whose charge rests the welfare of the young, an overwhelming desire to surround children with those environmental stimuli only which will tend to their highest ultimate welfare. Such is the stimulating force of tradition that many who have been educated under the tenets of traditional beliefs will oppose these hypotheses--even violently, it may be. So they have opposed them; so they opposed Darwin; so they have opposed all new and apparently revolutionary doctrines. Yet these persons themselves are by their very actions proving the efficiency of the vital principles which we have enunciated. What is the whole social welfare movement but a recognition on the part of municipalities, educational boards, and religious organizations of the fact that the future welfare of the race depends upon the administration to the young of forceful uplifting environmental stimuli? There are now, as there were in Darwin's day, many who feel that man is degraded from his high estate by the conception that he is not a reasoning, willing being, the result of a special creation. But one may wonder indeed what conception of the origin of man can be more wonderful or more inspiring than the belief that he has been slowly evolved through the ages, and that all creatures have had a part in his development; that each form of life has contributed and is contributing still to his present welfare and to his future advancement. Recapitulation Psychology,--the science of the human soul and its relations,-- under the mechanistic theory of life, must receive a new definition. It becomes a science of man's activities as determined by the environmental stimuli of his phylogeny and of his ontogeny. On this basis we postulate that throughout the history of the race nothing has been lost, but that every experience of the race and of the individual has been retained for the guidance of the individual and of the race; that for the accomplishment of this end there has been evolved through the ages a nerve mechanism of such infinite delicacy and precision that in some unknown manner it can register permanently within itself every impression received in the phylogenetic and ontogenetic experience of the individual; that each of these nerve mechanisms or brain patterns has its own connection with the external world, and that each is attuned to receive impressions of but one kind, as in the apparatus of wireless telegraphy each instrument can receive and interpret waves of a certain rate of intensity only; that thought, will, ego, personality, perception, imagination, reason, emotion, choice, memory, are to be interpreted in terms of these brain patterns; that these so-called phenomena of human life depend upon the stimuli which can secure the final common path, this in turn having been determined by the frequency and the strength of the environmental stimuli of the past and of the present. Finally, as for life's origin and life's ultimate end, we are content to say that they are unknown, perhaps unknowable. We know only that living matter, like lifeless matter, has its own place in the cosmic processes; that the gigantic forces which operated to produce a world upon which life could exist, as a logical sequence, when the time was ripe, evolved life; and finally that these cosmic forces are still active, though none can tell what worlds and what races may be the result of their coming activities. A MECHANISTIC THEORY OF DISEASE[*] [*] Oration in Surgery.  Delivered at the 147th Annual Meeting of the Medical Society of New Jersey, at Spring Lake, N. J., June 11, 1913. In this address the paragraphs which were taken from the preceding paper, "A Mechanistic View of Psychology," have been omitted, those portions only being republished in which the premises have been applied in a discussion of certain medical problems rather than of psychological problems. The human body is an elaborate mechanism equipped first for such conflict with environment as will tend to the preservation of the individual, and second for the propagation of the species, both of these functions, when most efficiently carried out, tending to the upbuilding and perfection of the race. From the date of Harvey's discovery of the circulation of the blood, to the present day, the human body has been constantly compared to a machine, but the time for analogy and comparison is past. I postulate that the body is itself a mechanism responding in every part to the adequate stimuli given it from without by the environment of the present and from within by the environment of the past, the memory of which is stored in the central battery of the mechanism-- the brain.  *   *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *  *   *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    * If the full history of the species and of the individual could be known in every detail, then every detail of that individual's conduct in health and disease could be predicted. Reaction to environment is the basis of conduct, of moral standards, of manners and conventions, of work and play, of love and hate, of protection and murder, of governing and being governed, in fact, of all the reactions between human beings--of the entire web of life. As Sherrington has stated, "Environment drives the brain, the brain drives the various organs of the body," and here we believe we find the key to a mechanistic interpretation of all body processes. On this basis we may see that the activities of life depend upon the ability of the parts of the body mechanism to respond adequately to adequate stimulation.  This postulate applies not only to stimuli from visible forces, but to those received by the invasion of the micro-bodies which cause pyogenic or non-pyogenic infections. In the case of dangerous assaults by visible or invisible enemies, the brain, through the nerves and all parts of the motor mechanism, meets the attack by attempts at adaptation.  Recovery, invalidism, and death depend upon the degree of success with which the attacking or invading enemies are met.  Questions regarding disease become, therefore, questions in adaptation, and it is possible that, when studied in the light of this conception, the key to many hitherto unsolved physical problems may be found. Perhaps no more convincing proof of our thesis may be secured than by a study of that ever-present phenomenon--pain.  In whatever part of the body and by whatever apparent cause pain is produced, we find that it is invariably a stimulation to motor activity-- whose ultimate object is protection.  Thus by the muscular action resulting from pain we are protected against heat and cold; against too powerful light; against local anemia caused by prolonged pressure upon any portion of the body.  So, too, pain of greater or less intensity compels the required emptying of the pregnant uterus and the evacuation of the intestine and the urinary bladder. It should be noted that in every instance the muscular activity resulting from pain is specific in its type, its distribution, and its intensity, this specificity being true not only of pain which is the result of external stimulation, but also of the pain associated with certain types of infection. Pain, however, is not the only symptom of the invasion of the body by pyogenic or parasitic organisms.  Fever, invariably, and chills, often, accompany the course of the infections. Can these phenomena also be explained as adaptations of the motor mechanism for the good of the individual? As the phenomena of chills and fever are most strikingly exhibited in malaria, let us study the course of events in that disease. It is known that the malarial parasite develops in the red blood-corpuscles, and that the chills and fever appear when the cycle of parasitic development is complete and the adults are ready to escape from the corpuscles of the blood plasma. Bass, of New Orleans, has proved that the favorable temperature for the growth of the malarial organism is 98'0, and that at 102'0 the adult organisms will be killed, though the latter temperature is not fatal to the spores.  The adult life of the malarial parasite begins after its escape into the blood plasma, and it is there that the organism is most susceptible to high temperature. We must infer, therefore, that the fever is an adaptation on the part of the host for despatching the enemy. What, then, may be the protective part played by the chill? A chill is made up of intermittent contractions of all the external muscles of the body.  This activity results in an increase of the body heat and in an anemia of the superficial parts of the body, so that less heat can be lost by radiation. By this means, therefore, the external portions of the body contribute measurably to the production of the beneficent and saving fever. It must be remembered that this power of adaptation is not peculiar to man alone, but that it is a quality shared by all living creatures. While the human body has been adapting itself for self-protection by producing a febrile reaction whereby to kill the invading organisms, the invaders on their side have been adapting themselves for a life struggle within the body of the host.  In these mortal conflicts between invaders and host, therefore, the issue is often in doubt, and sometimes one and sometimes the other will emerge victorious. We must believe that a similar adaptive response exists in all parasitic infections--the cycles varying according to the stages in the development of the invaders.  If the bacteria develop continuously, the fever is constant instead of intermittent, since the adequate stimulus is constantly present. Bacteriology has taught us that both heat and cold are fatal to pathogenic infections; for this reason either of the apparently contradictory methods of treatment may help, _i.  e_., either hot or cold applications.  It should be borne in mind, however, that we have to deal not only with the adult organisms, but with the spores also. The application of cold may keep the spores from developing, while heat may promote their development, and the course of the disease may vary, therefore, according to our choice of treatment. From this viewpoint, we can understand the intermittent temperature in a patient who is convalescing from an extreme infection, as peritonitis, pylephlebitis, multiple abscess of the liver, etc. In these conditions there may occur days of normal temperature, followed by an abrupt rise which will last for several days-- this in turn succeeded by another remittance.  This cycle may be repeated several times, and on our hypothesis we may believe it is caused by the successive development to maturity of spores of varying ages. If these premises are sound, the wisdom of reducing the temperature in case of infection may well be questioned. On this mechanistic basis the emotions also may be explained as activations of the entire motor mechanism for fighting, for escaping, for copulating.  *   *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *  *   *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    * The emotions, then, are the preparation for phylogenetic activities (Fig. 48). If the activities were consummated, the fuel--glycogen-- and the activating secretions from the thyroid, the adrenals, the hypophysis, would be consumed.  In the activation without action these products must be eliminated as waste products and so a heavy strain is put upon the organs of elimination. It is obvious that the body under emotion might be clarified by active muscular exercise, but the subject of the emotion is so strongly integrated thereby that it is difficult for him to engage in diverting, clarifying exertion.  *   *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *  *   *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    * So, as we have indicated already, certain deleterious effects are produced when the body mechanism is activated without resultant action. For example, the output of adrenalin is increased, and, as a consequence, arteriosclerosis and cardiovascular disease may occur in persons who have been subjected to prolonged emotional strain, since it has been proved that the prolonged administration of adrenalin will cause these conditions.  We have stated that the emotions cause increased output of glycogen.  Glycogen is a step toward diabetes, and therefore this disease, too, is prone to appear in persons under emotional strain.  It is most common in those races which are especially emotional in character, so we are not surprised to find it especially prevalent among Jews.  So common is this particular result of prolonged emotion that some one has said, "When the stocks go down in New York, diabetes goes up." Nephritis, also, may result from emotional stress, because of the strain put upon the kidneys by the unconsumed activating substances. The increased heart action and the presence of these activating secretions may cause myocarditis and heart degeneration. Claudication also may result from the impaired circulation. The emotions may cause an inhibition of the digestive secretions and of intestinal peristalsis.  This means that the digestive processes are arrested, that putrefaction and autointoxication will result, and that still further strain will thus be put upon the organs of elimination.  Who has not observed in himself and in others when under the influence of fear, anger, jealousy, or grief that the digestive processes and general well-being are rapidly and materially altered; while as tranquillity, peace, and happiness return the physical state improves accordingly? Dentists testify that as a result of continued strong emotion the character of the saliva changes, pyorrhea develops, and the teeth decay rapidly. Every one knows that strong emotion may cause the hair to fall out and to become prematurely gray. As to the most important organ of all--the brain--every one is conscious of its impaired efficiency under emotional strain, and laboratory researches show that the deficiency is accounted for by actual cell deterioration; so the individual who day by day is under heavy emotional strain finds himself losing strength slowly-- especially do his friends note it.  By summation of stimuli his threshold becomes lowered until stimuli, which under normal conditions would be of no effect, produce undue responses. "The grasshopper becomes a burden," and prolonged rest and change of environmental conditions are necessary for restoration. If in a long emotional strain the brain is beaten down; if the number of "low-efficiency" cells increases, the driving power of the brain is correspondingly lessened and therefore the various organs of the body may escape through the very inefficiency of the brain to produce in them forced activity. On the other hand, if the brain remains vigorous, the kidneys may take the strain and break down; if the kidneys do not break, the blood-vessels may harden; if the blood-vessels are not affected, the thyroid may become hyperplastic and produce Graves' disease; if the thyroid escapes, diabetes may develop; while if the iron constitution of the mechanism can successfully bear the strain in all its parts, then the individual will break his competitors, and their mechanisms will suffer in the struggle. This whole train of deleterious results of body activation without action may be best observed and studied in that most emotional of diseases--exophthalmic goiter.  In this disease the constantly stimulated distance ceptors dispossess the contact ceptors from the common path, and drive the motor mechanism to its own destruction, and the patient has the appearance of a person in great terror, or of a runner approaching the end of a Marathon race (Figs. 16 and 48 to 54). Exophthalmic goiter may result from long emotional or mental stress in those cases in which the thyroid takes the brunt of the strain upon the mechanism.  As adrenalin increases blood-pressure, so thyroid secretion increases brain activity, and increased brain activity in turn causes an increased activation of the motor mechanism as a whole. We know that a deficiency or lack of thyroid secretion will inhibit sexual emotion and conception, will produce stupidity and inertia; will diminish vitality.  On the other hand, excessive thyroid secretion drives the entire mechanism at top speed; the emotions are intensified; the skin becomes soft and moist, the eyes are brilliant and staring; the limbs tremble; the heart pounds loudly and its pulsations often are visible; the respiration is rapid; the stimulation of the fear mechanism causes the eyes to protrude (Fig. 16); the temperature mounts at every slight provoca-tion and may reach the incredible height of 110'0 even.  In time, the entire organism is destroyed-- literally consumed--by the concentration of dynamic energy. It is interesting to note that in these patients emotion gains complete possession of the final common path; they are wild and delirious-- but they never have pain. All the diseases caused by excessive motor activity may be called kinetic diseases.  Against the conditions in life which produce them man reacts in various ways.  He intro- {illust. caption = FIG.  51.--CROSS-COUNTRY RACE.  Winner of six-mile cross-country race showing typical expression of exhaustion. (Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N. Y.) duces restful variety into his life by hunting and fishing; by playing golf and tennis; by horseback riding; by cultivating hobbies which effectually. turn the current of his thoughts{illust. caption = FIG.  52.--{A B and C} from the consuming stress and strain of his business or professional life.  These diversions are all rational attempts to relieve tension by self-preservative reactions. For the same reason man attempts to relieve the strain of contention with his fellow-man by unions, trusts, corporations. In spite of all efforts, however, many constitutions are still broken daily in the fierce conflicts of competition. We know how often the overdriven individual endeavors to minimize the activities of his motor mechanism by the use of agents which diminish brain activity, such as alcohol, tobacco, and various narcotics. Occasionally also, some person, who can find no respite from his own relentless energies, seeks relief in oblivion by suicide. Most fortunately, two fundamental instincts--self-preservation and the propagation of the species--act powerfully to prevent this last fatal result, and instead the harassed individual seeks from others the aid which is lacking within himself. He may turn to the priest who seeks and often secures the final common path for faith in an over-ruling Providence, a faith which in many incontrovertible instances has proved sufficient in very truth to move mountains of lesser stimuli; or he turns to a physician, who too often treats the final outcome of the hyperactivity only. The physician who accepts the theory of the kinetic diseases, however, will not only repair as far as he may the lesions caused by the disordered and forced activities, but will, by compelling and forceful suggestion, secure the final common path for right conduct, that is, for a self- and species-preservative course of action as opposed to wrong conduct-a self- and species-destructive course of action. By forcefully imparting to his patient the knowledge of the far-reaching effects of protracted emotional strain, of overwork, and of worry, the physician will automatically raise his threshold to the damaging activating stimuli which have produced the evil results. Even though some parts of his organism may have been permanently disabled, a patient thus protected may yet rise to a plane of poise and efficiency far above that of his uncontrolled fellows. In extreme cases it does not seem unreasonable to believe that the uncontrolled patient might be rescued by the same principle which has proved effective in saving patients from the emotional and traumatic strain of surgical operations--the principle of anoci-association. That is, by disconnecting one or more of the activating organs from the brain, the motor mechanism might be saved from its self-destruction. Under this hypothesis, that man in disease, as in health, is the product of his phylogeny as well as of ontogeny, the sphere of the physician's activities takes on new aspects of far-reaching and inspiring significance.  Prognosis will become definite in proportion to the physician's knowledge not only of the ontogenetic history of the individual patient, but also of the phylogenetic history of the race. As that knowledge increases, as he appreciates more and more keenly the significance of environment in its effect upon individual development, in so far will the physician be in a position to contribute mightily to the welfare of the race. THE KINETIC SYSTEM[*] [*] Address delivered before the New York State Medical Society, April 28, 1914, to which has been added a further note regarding studies of hydrogen ion concentration in the blood. In this paper I formulate a theory which I hope will harmonize a large number of clinical and experimental data, supply an interpretation of certain diseases, and show by what means many diverse causes produce the same end effects. Even should the theory prove ultimately to be true, it will in the mean time doubtless be subjected to many alterations.  The specialized laboratory worker will, at first, fail to see the broader clinical view, and the trained clinician may hesitate to accept the laboratory findings. Our viewpoint has been gained from a consideration of both lines of evidence on rather a large scale. The responsibility for the kinetic theory is assumed by myself, while the responsibility for the experimental data is shared fully by my associates, Dr. J. B. Austin, Dr. F. W. Hitchings, Dr. H. G. Sloan, and Dr. M. L. Menten.[t] [t] From H. K. Cushing Laboratory of Experimental Medicine, Western Reserve University, Cleveland. Introduction The self-preservation of man and kindred animals is effected through mechanisms which transform latent energy into kinetic energy to accomplish adaptive ends.  Man appropriates from environment the energy he requires in the form of crude food which is refined by the digestive system; oxygen is taken to the blood and carbon dioxid is taken from the blood by the respiratory system; to and from the myriads of working cells of the body, food and oxygen and waste are carried by the circulatory system; the body is cleared of waste by the urinary system; procreation is accomplished through the genital system; but none of these systems was evolved primarily for the purpose of transforming potential energy into kinetic energy for specific ends.  Each system transforms such amounts of potential into kinetic energy as are required to perform its specific work; but no one of them transforms latent into kinetic energy for the purposes of escaping, fighting, pursuing, nor for combating infection. The stomach, the kidneys, the lungs, the heart strike no physical blow-their role is to do certain work to the end that the blow may be struck by another system evolved for that purpose.  I propose to offer evidence that there is in the body a system evolved primarily for the transformation of latent energy into motion and into heat. This system I propose to designate "The Kinetic System." The kinetic system does not directly circulate the blood, nor does it exchange oxygen and carbon dioxid; nor does it perform the functions of digestion, urinary elimination, and procreation; but though the kinetic system does not directly perform these functions, it does play indirectly an important role in each, just as the kinetic system itself is aided indirectly by the other systems. The principal organs which comprise the kinetic system are the brain, the thyroid, the adrenals, the liver, and the muscles. The brain is the great central battery which drives the body; the thyroid governs the conditions favoring tissue oxidation; the adrenals govern immediate oxidation processes; the liver fabricates and stores glycogen; and the muscles are the great converters of latent energy into heat and motion. Adrenalin alone, thyroid extract alone, brain activity alone, and muscular activity alone are capable of causing the body temperature to rise above the normal.  The functional activity of no other gland of the body alone, and the secretion of no other gland alone, can cause a comparable rise in body temperature--that is, neither increased functional activity nor any active principle derived from the kidney, the liver, the stomach, the pancreas, the hypophysis, the parathyroids, the spleen, the intestines, the thymus, the lymphatic glands, or the bones can, _per se_, cause a rise in the general body temperature comparable to the rise that may be caused by the activity of the brain or the muscles, or by the injection of adrenalin or thyroid extract.  Then, too, when the brain, the thyroid, the adrenals, the liver, or the muscles are eliminated, the power of the body to convert latent into kinetic energy is impaired or lost. I shall offer evidence tending to show that an excess of either internal or external environmental stimuli may modify one or more organs of the kinetic system, and that this modification may cause certain diseases.  For example, alterations in the efficiency of the cerebral link may yield neurasthenia, mania, dementia; of the thyroid link, Graves' disease, myxedema; of the adrenal link, Addison's disease, cardiovascular disease. This introduction may serve to give the line of our argument. We shall now consider briefly certain salient facts which relate to the conversion of latent into kinetic energy as an adaptive reaction. The experimental data are so many that they will later be published in a monograph. The amount of latent energy which may be converted into kinetic energy for adaptive ends varies in different species, in individuals of the same species, in the same individual in different seasons; in the life cycle of growth, reproduction and decay; in the waking and sleeping hours; in disease and in activity. We shall here consider briefly the reasons for some of those variations and the mechanisms which make them possible. Biologic Consideration of the Adaptive Variation in Amounts of Energy Stored in Various Animals Energy is appropriated from the physical forces of nature that constitute the environment.  This energy is stored in the body in quantities in excess of the needs of the moment. In some animals this excess storage is greater than in other animals. Those animals whose self-preservation is dependent on purely mechanical or chemical means of defense--such animals as crustaceans, porcupines, skunks or cobras--have a relatively small amount of convertible (adaptive) energy stored in their bodies. On the contrary, the more an animal is dependent on its muscular activity for self-preservation, the more surplus available (adaptive) energy there is stored in its body.  It may be true that all animals have approximately an equal amount per kilo of chemical energy-- but certainly they have not an equal amount stored in a form which is available for immediate conversion for adaptive ends. Adaptive Variation in the Rate of Energy Discharge What chance for survival would a skunk have without odor; a cobra without venom; a turtle without carapace; or a porcupine shorn of its barbs, in an environment of powerful and hostile carnivora? And yet in such an hostile environment many unprotected animals survive by their muscular power of flight alone.  It is evident that the provision for the storage of "adaptive" energy is not the only evolved characteristic which relates to the energy of the body. The more the self-preservation of the animal depends on motor activity, the greater is the range of variation in the rate of discharge of energy. The rate of energy discharge is especially high in animals evolved along the line of hunter and hunted, such as the carnivora and the herbivora of the great plains. Influences That Cause Variation in the Rate of Output of Energy in the Individual Not only is there a variation in the rate of output of energy among various species of animals, but one finds also variations in the rate of output of energy among individuals of the same species. If our thesis that men and animals are mechanisms responding to environmental stimuli be correct, and further, if the speed of energy output be due to changes in the activating organs as a result of adaptive stimulation, then we should expect to find physical changes in the activating glands during the cycles of increased activation. What are the facts?  We know that most animals have breeding seasons evolved as adaptations to the food supply and weather. Hence there is in most animals a mating season in advance of the season of maximum food supply so that the young may appear at the period when food is most abundant.  In the springtime most birds and mammals mate, and in the springtime at least one of the great activating glands is enlarged--the thyroid in man and in animals shows seasonal enlargement.  The effect of the increased activity is seen in the song, the courting, the fighting, in the quickened pulse, and in a slightly raised temperature.  Even more activation than that connected with the season is seen in the physical state of mating, when the thyroid is known to enlarge materially, though this increased activity, as we shall show later, is probably no greater than the increased activity of other activating glands. In the mating season the kinetic activity is speeded up; in short, there exists a state--a fleeting state--of mild Graves' disease. In the early stages of Graves' disease, before the destructive phenomena are felt, the kinetic speed is high, and life is on a sensuous edge. Not only is there a seasonal rhythm to the rate of flow of energy, but there is a diurnal variation--the ebb is at night, and the full tide in the daytime.  This observation is verified by the experiments which show that certain organs in the kinetic chain are histologically exhausted, the depleted cells being for the most part restored by sleep. We have seen that there are variations in speed in different species, and that in the same species speed varies with the season of the year and with the time of day.  In addition there are variations also in the rate of discharge of energy in the various cycles of the life of the individual.  The young are evolved at high speed for growth, so that as soon as possible they may attain to their own power of self-defense; they must adapt themselves to innumerable bacteria, to food, and to all the elements in their external environment. Against their gross enemies the young are measurably protected by their parents; but the parents--except to a limited extent in the case of man--are unable to assist in the protection of the young against infectious disease. The cycle of greatest kinetic energy for physiologic ends is the period of reproduction.  In the female especially there is a cycle of increased activity just prior to her development into the procreative state. During this time secondary sexual characters are developed-- the pelvis expands, the ovaries and the uterus grow rapidly, the mammary glands develop.  Again in this period of increasing speed in the expenditure of energy we find the thyroid, the adrenals, and the hypophysis also in rapid growth. Without the normal development of the ovary, the thyroid, and the hypophysis, neither the male nor the female can develop the secondary sexual characters, nor do they develop sexual desire nor show seasonal cycles of activity, nor can they procreate. The secondary sexual characters--sexual desire, fertility--may be developed at will, for example, by feeding thyroid products from alien species to the individual deprived of the thyroid. At the close of the child-bearing period there is a permanent diminution of the speed of energy discharge, for energy is no longer needed as it was for the self-preservation of the offspring before adolescence, and for the propagation of the species during the procreative period.  Unless other factors intervene, this reduction in speed is progressive until senescent death. The diminished size of the thyroid of the aged bears testimony to the part the activating organs bear in the general decline. We have now referred to variations in the rate of discharge of energy in different species; in individuals of the same species; in cycles in the same individual--such as the seasons of food supply, the periods of wakefulness and of sleep, the procreative period, and we have spoken of those variations caused artificially by thyroid feeding, thus far having confined our discussion to the conversion for adaptive purposes of latent into kinetic energy in muscular and in procreative action.  We shall now consider the conversion of latent into kinetic energy in the production of heat,[*] and endeavor to answer the questions which arise at once: Is there one mechanism for the conversion of latent energy into heat and another mechanism for its conversion into muscular action? What is the adaptive advantage of fever in infection? [*] We use the terms "heat" and "muscular action" in the popular sense, though physicists use them to designate one and the same kind of energy. The Purpose and the Mechanism of Heat Production in Infections Vaughan has shown that the presence in the body of any alien protein causes an increased production of heat, and that there is no difference between the production of fever by foreign proteins and by infections. Before the day of the hypodermic needle and of experimental medicine, the foreign proteins found in the body outside the alimentary tract were brought in by invading microorganisms.  Such organisms interfered with and destroyed the host.  The body, therefore, was forced to evolve a means of protection against these hostile organisms. The increased metabolism and fever in infection might operate as a protection in two ways--the increased fever, by interfering with bacterial growth, and the increased metabolism, by breaking up the bacteria.  Bacteriologists have taught us that bacteria grow best at the normal temperature of the body, hence fever must interfere with bacterial growth.  With each rise of one degree centigrade the chemical activity of the body is increased 10 per cent. In acute infections there is aversion to food and frequently there is vomiting.  In fever, then, we have diminished intake of energy, but an increased output of energy--hence the available potential energy in the body is rapidly consumed.  This may be an adaptation for the purpose of breaking up the foreign protein molecules composing the bacteria.  Thus the body may be purified by a chemical combustion so furious that frequently the host itself is destroyed. The problems of immunity are not considered here. As to the mechanism which produces fever, we postulate that it is the same mechanism as that which produces muscular activity. Muscular activity is produced by the conversion of latent energy into motion, and fever is produced largely in the muscles by the conversion of latent energy into heat.  We should, therefore, find similar changes in the brain, the adrenals, the thyroid, and the liver, whatever may be the purpose of the conversion of energy-- whether for running, for fighting, for the expression of emotion, or for combating infection. We shall first present experimental and clinical evidence which tends to show what part is played by the brain in the production of both muscular and febrile action, and later we shall discuss the parts played by the adrenals, the thyroid, and the liver.  Histologic Changes in the Brain-cells in Relation to the Maintenance of Consciousness and to the Production of the Emotions, Muscular Activity, and Fever We have studied the brain-cells in human cases of fever, and in animals after prolonged insomnia; after the injection of the toxins of gonococci, of streptococci, of staphylococci, and of colon, tetanus, diphtheria, and typhoid bacilli; and after the injection of foreign proteins, of indol and skatol, of leucin, and of peptones.  We have studied the brains of animals which had been activated in varying degrees up to the point of complete exhaustion by running, by fighting, by rage and fear, by physical injury, and by the injection of strychnin (Figs. 2, 4, 5, and 37). We have studied the brains of salmon at the mouth of the Columbia River and at its headwater (Fig. 55); the brains of electric fish, the storage batteries of which had been partially discharged, and of those the batteries of which had been completely discharged; the brains of woodchucks in hibernation and after fighting; the brains of humans who had died from anemia resulting from hemorrhage, from acidosis, from eclampsia, from cancer and from other chronic diseases (Figs. 40 to 43, 56, 74, and 75). We have studied also the brains of animals after the excision of the adrenals, of the pancreas, and of the liver (Figs. 57 and 60). In every instance the loss of vitality--that is, the loss of the normal power to convert potential into kinetic energy-- was accompanied by physical changes in the brain-cells (Figs. 45 and 46). The converse was also true, that is, the brain-cells of animals with normal vital power showed no histologic changes. The changes in the brain-cells were identical whatever the cause. The crucial question then becomes:  Are these constant changes in the brain-cells the result of work done by the brain-cells in running, in fighting, in emotion, in fever?  In other words, does the brain perform a definite role in the conversion of latent energy into fever or into muscular action; or are the brain-cell changes caused by the chemical products of metabolism?  Happily, this crucial question was definitely answered by the following experiment: The circulations of two dogs were crossed in such a manner that the circulation of the head of one dog was anastomosed with the circulation of the body of another dog, and vice versa.  A cord encircled the neck of each so firmly that the anastomosing circulation was blocked (Fig. 58). If the brain-cell changes were due to metabolic products, then when the body of dog "A" was injured, the brain of dog "A" would be normal and the brain of dog "B" would show changes. Our experiments showed brain-cell changes in the brain of the dog injured and no changes in the brain of the uninjured dog. The injection of adrenalin causes striking brain-cell changes: first, a hyperchromatism, then a chromatolysis.  Now if adrenalin caused these changes merely as a metabolic phenomenon and not as a "work" phenomenon, then the injection of adrenalin into the carotid artery of a crossed circulation dog would cause no change in its circulation and its respiration, since the brain thus injected is in exclusive vascular connection with the body of another dog. In our experiment the blood-pressures of both dogs were recorded on a drum when adrenalin was injected into the common carotid. The adrenalin caused a rise in blood-pressure, an increase in the force of cardiac contraction, increase in respiration, and a characteristic adrenalin rise in the blood-pressure of both dogs. The rise was seen first in the dog whose brain alone received adrenalin and about a minute later in the dog whose body alone received adrenalin (Fig. 59). Histologic examinations of the brains of both dogs showed marked hyperchromatism in the brain receiving adrenalin, while the brain receiving no adrenalin showed no change. Here is a clear-cut observation on the action of adrenalin on the brain, for both the functional and the histologic tests showed that adrenalin causes increased brain action. The significance of this affinity of the brain for adrenalin begins to be seen when I call attention to the following striking facts: 1.  Adrenalin alone causes hyperchromatism followed by chromatolysis, and in overdosage causes the destruction of some brain-cells. 2.  When both adrenal glands are excised and no other factor is introduced, the Nissl substance progressively disappears from the brain-cells until death.  This far-reaching point will be taken up later (Fig. 60). Here our purpose is to discuss the cause of the brain-cell changes. We have seen that in crossed brain and body circulation trauma causes changes in the cells of the brain which is disconnected from the traumatized body by its circulation, but which is connected with the traumatized body by the nervous system. We have seen that adrenalin causes activation of the body connected with its brain by the nervous system, and histologic changes in the brain acted on directly by the adrenalin, but we found no notable brain-cell changes in the other brain through which the products of metabolism have circulated. In the foregoing we find direct evidence that the products of metabolism are not the principal cause of the brain-cell changes. We shall now present evidence to show that for the most part the brain-cell changes are "work" changes.  What work?  We postulate that it is the work by which the energy stored in the brain-cells is converted into electricity or some other form of transmissible energy which then activates certain glands and muscles, thus converting latent energy into beat and motion.  It has chanced that certain other studies have given an analogous and convincing proof of this postulate. In the electric fish a part of the muscular mechanism is replaced by a specialized structure for storing and discharging electricity. We found "work" changes in the brain-cells of electric fish after all their electricity had been rapidly discharged (Fig. 61). We found further that electric fish could not discharge their electricity when under anesthesia, and clinically we know that under deep morphin narcosis, and under anesthesia, the production both of heat and of muscular action is hindered. The action of morphin in lessening fever production is probably the result of its depressing influence on the brain-cells, because of which a diminished amount of their potential energy is converted into electricity and a diminished electric discharge from the brain to the muscles should diminish heat production proportionally. We found by experiment that under deep morphinization brain-cell changes due to toxins could be largely prevented (Fig. 62); in human patients deep morphinization diminishes the production of muscular action and of fever and conserves life when it is threatened by acute infections.  The contribution of the brain-cells to the production of heat is either the result of the direct conversion of their stored energy into heat, or of the conversion of their latent energy into electricity or a similar force, which in turn causes certain glands and muscles to convert latent energy into heat. A further support to the postulate that the brain-cells contribute to the production of fever by sending impulses to the muscles is found in the effect of muscular exertion, or of other forms of motor stimulation, in the presence of a fever-producing infection. Under such circumstances muscular exertion causes additional fever, and causes also added but identical changes in the brain-cells. Thyroid extract and iodin have the same effect as muscular exertion and infection in the production of fever and the production of brain-cell changes. All this evidence is a strong argument in favor of the theory that certain constituents of the brain-cells are consumed in the work performed by the brain in the production of fever. That the stimulation of the brain-cells without gross activity of the skeletal muscles and without infection can produce heat is shown as follows: (_a_) Fever is produced when animals are subjected to fear without any consequent exertion of the skeletal muscles. (_b_) The temperature of the anxious friends of patients will rise while they await the outcome of an operation (Fig. 63). (_c_) The temperature and pulse of patients will rise as a result of the mere anticipation of a surgical operation (Fig. 64). (_d_) There are innumerable clinical observations as to the effect of emotional excitation on the temperature of patients. A rise of a degree or more is a common result of a visit from a tactless friend.  There is a traditional Sunday increase of temperature in hospital wards.  Now the visitor does not bring and administer more infection to the patient to cause this rise, and the rise of temperature occurs even if the patient does not make the least muscular exertion as a result of the visit. I once observed an average increase of one and one-eighth degrees of temperature in a ward of fifteen children as a result of a Fourth of July celebration. Is the contribution of the brain to the production of heat due to the conversion of latent energy directly into heat, or does the brain produce heat principally by converting its latent energy into electricity or some similar form of transmissible energy which, through nerve connections, stimulates other organs and tissues, which in turn convert their stores of latent energy into heat? According to Starling, when the connection between the brain and the muscles of an animal is severed by curare, by anesthetics, by the division of the cord and nerves, then the heat-producing power of the animal so modified is on a level with that of cold-blooded animals. With cold the temperature falls, with heat it rises.  Such an animal has no more control over the conversion of latent energy into heat than it has over the conversion of latent energy into motion. Electric stimulation done over a period of time causes brain-cell changes, and electric stimulation of the muscles causes a rise in temperature. Summary of Brain-cell Studies In our crossed circulation experiments we found that neither waste products nor metabolic poisons could be considered the principal cause of the brain-cell changes.  We found that in the production both of muscular action and of fever there were brain-cell changes which showed a quantita-tive relation to the temperature changes or to the muscular work done.  We observed that under deep morphinization the febrile response or the muscular work done was either diminished or eliminated and that the brain-cell changes were correspondingly diminished or eliminated.  We found also that brain-cell changes and muscular work followed electric stimulation alone. I conclude, therefore, that the brain-cell changes are work changes. We shall next consider other organs of the kinetic system in their relation to muscular activity, to emotion, to consciousness, to sleep, to hibernation, and to heat production. The Adrenals In our extensive study of the brain in its relation to the production of energy and the consequent exhaustion caused by fear and rage; by the injection of foreign proteins, of bacterial toxins, and of strychnin; by anaphylaxis; by the injection of thyroid extract, of adrenalin, and of morphin, we found that, with the exception of morphin, each of these agents produced identical changes in the brain-cells. As we believed that the adrenals were intimately associated with the brain in its activities, we concluded that the adrenals also must have been affected by each of these agents. To prove this relation, we administered the above-mentioned stimuli to animals and studied their effects upon the adrenals by functional, histologic, and surgical methods, the functional tests being made by Cannon's method. Functional Study of the Adrenals.--Our method of applying the Cannon test for adrenalin was as follows:  (_a_) The blood of the animals was tested before the application of the stimulus. If this test was negative, then (_b_) the stimulus was applied and the blood again tested.  If this second test was negative, a small amount of adrenalin was added.  If a positive reaction was then given, the negative result was accepted as conclusive. (_c_) If the control test was negative, then the stimulus was given. If the blood after stimulation gave a positive result for adrenalin, a second test of the same animal's blood was made twenty-five minutes or more later.  If the second test was negative, then the positive result of the first test was accepted as conclusive. We have recorded 66 clear-cut experiments on dogs, which show that after fear and rage, after anaphylaxis, after injections of indol and skatol, of leucin and creatin, of the toxins of diphtheria and colon bacilli, of streptococci and staphylococci, of foreign proteins, and of strychnin, the Cannon test for adrenalin was positive. The test was negative after trauma under anesthesia, and after intravenous injections of thyroid extract, of thyroglobin, and of the juices of various organs injected into the same animal from which the organs were taken.  Placental extract gave a positive test. The test was sometimes positive after electric stimulation of the splanchnic nerves.  On the other hand, if the nerve supply to the adrenals had been previously divided, or if the adrenals had been previously excised, then the Cannon test was negative after the administration of each of the foregoing adequate stimuli. Blood taken directly from the adrenal vein gave a positive result, but under deep morphinization the blood from the adrenal vein was negative, and under deep morphinization the foregoing adequate stimuli were negative. In brief, the agencies that in our brain-cell studies were found to cause hyperchromatism followed by chromatolysis gave positive results in the Cannon test for adrenalin (Fig. 62). The one agent which was found to protect the brain against changes in the Nissl substance-- morphin--gave a negative result in the Cannon test for adrenalin. After excision of the adrenals, or after division of their nerve supply, all Cannon tests for adrenalin were negative. Histologic Study of the Adrenals.--Histologic studies of the adrenals after the application of the adequate stimuli which gave positive results to the Cannon test for adrenalin are now in progress, and thus far the histologic studies corroborate the functional tests. In hibernating woodchucks, the cells of the adrenal cortex were found to be vacuolated and shrunken.  In one hundred hours of insomnia, in surgical shock, in strong fear, in exhaustion from fighting, after peptone injections, in acute infections, the adrenals undergo histologic changes characteristic of exhaustion (Figs. 66 to 67). We have shown that brain and adrenal activity go hand in hand, that is, that the adrenal secretion activates the brain, and that the brain activates the adrenals.  The fundamental question which now arises is this:  Are the brain and the adrenals interdependent? A positive answer may be given to this question, for the evidence of the dependence of the brain upon the adrenals is as clear as is the evidence of the dependence of the adrenals upon the brain. (1) After excision of the adrenals, the brain-cells undergo continuous histologic and functional deterioration until death. During this time the brain progressively loses its power to respond to stimuli and there is also a progressive loss of muscular power and a diminution of body temperature. (2) {illust. caption = FIG.  66.In our crossed circulation experiments we found that adrenalin alone could cause increased brain activity, while histologically we know that adrenalin alone causes an increase of the Nissl substance.  An animal, both of whose adrenals had been excised, showed no hyperchromatism in the brain-cells after the injection of strychnin, toxins, foreign proteins, etc. (3) When the adrenal nerve supply is divided (Cannon-Elliott), then there is no increased adrenal activity in response to adequate stimuli. From these studies we are forced to conclude not only that the brain and adrenals are interdependent, but that the brain is actually more dependent upon the adrenals than the adrenals upon the brain, since the brain deteriorates progressively to death without the adrenals, while the adrenal whose connection with the brain has been broken by the division of its nerve supply will still produce sufficient adrenalin to support life. From the strong affinity of the brain-cells for adrenalin which was manifested in our experiments we may strongly suspect that the Nissl substance is a volatile, extremely unstable combination of certain elements of the brain-cells and adrenalin, because the adrenals alone do not take the Nissl stain and the brain deprived of adrenalin also does not take Nissl stain.  The consumption of the Nissl substance in the brain-cells is lessened or prevented by morphin, as is the output of adrenalin; and the consumption of the Nissl substance is also lessened or prevented by nitrous oxid. But morphin does not prevent the action of adrenalin injected into the circulation, hence the control of morphin over energy expenditure is exerted directly on the brain-cells. Apparently morphin and nitrous oxid both act through this interference with oxidation in the brain.  We, therefore, conclude that within a certain range of acidity of the blood adrenalin can unite with the brain-cells only through the mediation of oxygen, and that the combination of adrenalin, oxygen, and certain brain-cell constituents causes the electric discharge that produces heat and motion. In this interrelation of the brain and the adrenals we have what is, perhaps, the master key to the automatic action of the body. Through the special senses environmental stimuli reach the brain and cause it to liberate energy, which in turn activates certain other organs and tissues, among which are the adrenals.  The increased output of adrenalin activates the brain to still greater activity, as a result of which again the entire sympathetic nervous system is further activated, as is manifested by increased heart action, more rapid respiration, raised blood-pressure, increased output of glycogen, increased power of the muscles to metabolize glucose, etc. If this conclusion be well founded, we should find corroborative evidence in histologic changes in that great storehouse of potential energy, the liver, as a result of the application of each of the adequate stimuli which produced brain-cell and adrenal changes. The Liver Prolonged insomnia, prolonged physical exertion, infections, injections of toxins and of strychnin, rage and fear, physical injury under anesthesia, in fact, all the adequate stimuli which affected the brain and the adrenals, produced constant and identical histologic changes in the liver--the cells stained poorly, the cytoplasm was vacuolated, the nuclei were crenated, the cell membranes were irregular, the most marked changes occurring in the cells of the periphery of the lobules (Figs. 69 and 70). In prolonged insomnia the striking changes in the liver were repaired by one seance of sleep. Are the histologic changes in the liver cells due to metabolism or toxic products, or are they "work" changes incident to the conversion of latent into kinetic energy?  Are the brain, adrenals, and liver interdependent? The following facts establish the answers to these queries: (1) The duration of life after excision of the liver is about the same as after adrenalectomy--approximately eighteen hours. (2) The amount of glycogen in the liver was diminished in all the experiments showing brain-adrenal activity; and when the histologic changes were repaired, the normal amount of glycogen was again found. (3) In crossed circulation experiments changes were found in the liver of the animal whose brain received the stimulus. From these premises we must consider that the brain, the adrenals, and the liver are mutually dependent on one another for the conversion of latent into kinetic energy.  Each is a vital organ, each equally vital. It may be said that excision of the brain may apparently cause death in less time than excision of the liver or adrenals, but this statement must be modified by our definition of death.  If all the brain of an animal be removed by decapitation, its body may live on for at least eleven hours if its circulation be maintained by transfusion. An animal may live for weeks or months after excision of the cerebral hemispheres and the cerebellum, while an overtransfused animal may live many hours, days even, after the destruction of the medulla. It is possible even that the brain actually is a less vital organ than either the adrenals or the liver. In our research to discover whether any other organs should be included with the brain, the adrenals, and the liver in this mutually interdependent relation, we hit upon an experiment which throws light upon this problem. Groups of rabbits were gently kept awake for one hundred hours by relays of students, an experiment which steadily withdrew energy but caused not the slightest physical or emotional injury to any of them; no drug, toxin, or other agent was given to them; they were given sufficient food and drink.  In brief, the internal and external environments of these animals were kept otherwise normal excepting for the gentle stimuli which insured continued wakefulness. This protracted insomnia gradually exhausted the animals completely, some to the point of death even.  Some of the survivors were killed immediately after the expiration of one hundred hours of wakefulness, others after varying intervals. Histologic studies were made of every tissue and organ in the body. Three organs, the brain, the adrenals, and the liver, and these three only, showed histologic changes.  In these three organs the histologic changes were marked, and were almost wholly repaired by one seance of sleep. In each instance these histologic changes were identical with those seen after physical exertion, emotions, toxins, etc.[*] It would appear, then, that these three organs take the stress of life-- the brain is the "battery," the adrenals the "oxydizer," and the liver the "gasoline tank."  This clear-cut insomnia experiment corresponds precisely with our other brain-adrenal observations. [*] Further studies have given evidence that the elimination of the acids resulting from energy-transformation as well as the conversion of energy stored in the kinetic organs causes histologic changes in the liver, the adrenals, and possibly in the brain. With these three kinetic organs we may surely associate also the "furnace," the muscles, in which the energy provided by the brain, adrenals, and liver, plus oxygen, is fabricated into heat and motion. Benedict, in his monumental work on metabolism, has demonstrated that in the normal state, at least, variations in the heart-beat parallel variations in metabolism.  He and others have shown also that all the energy of the body, whether evidenced by heat or by motion, is produced in the muscles.  In the muscles, then, we find the fourth vital link in the kinetic chain.  The muscles move the body, circulate the blood, effect respiration, and govern the body temperature. They are the passive servants of the brain-adrenal-liver syndrome. Neither the brain, the adrenals, the liver, nor the muscles, however, nor all of these together, have the power to change the rate of the expenditure of energy; to make possible the increased expenditure in adolescence, in pregnancy, in courting, and mating, in infections. No one of these organs, nor all of them together, can act as a pace-maker or sensitizer.  The brain acts immediately in response to the stimuli of the moment; the adrenals respond instantly to the fickle brain and the effects of their actions are fleeting; the liver contains fuel only and cannot activate, and the muscles in turn act as the great furnace in which the final transformation into available energy is made.  The Thyroid Another organ--the thyroid--has the special power of governing the RATE OF DISCHARGE of energy; in other words, the thyroid is the pace-maker. Unfortunately, the thyroid cannot be studied to advantage either functionally or histologically, for there is as yet no available test for thyroid secretion in the blood as there is for adrenalin, and thyroid activity is not attended by striking histologic changes. Therefore the only laboratory studies which have been satisfactory thus far are those by which the iodin content of the thyroid has been established.  Iodin is stored in the colloid lacunae of the thyroid and, in combination with certain proteins, is the active agent of the thyroid. Beebe has shown that electric stimulation of the nerve supply of the thyroid diminishes the amount of iodin which it contains, and it is known that in the hyperactive thyroid in Graves' disease the iodin content is diminished.  The meagerness of laboratory studies, however, is amply compensated by the observations which the surgeon has been able to make on a vast scale--observations which are as definite as are the results of laboratory experiments. The brain-cells and the adrenals are securely, concealed from the eye of the clinician, hence the changes produced in them by different causes escape his notice, but the thyroid has always been closely scrutinized by him.  The clinician knows that every one of the above-mentioned causes of increased brain-cell, adrenal, liver and muscle activity may cause an increase in the activity of both the normal or the enlarged thyroid; and lie knows only too well that in a given case of exophthalmic goiter the same stimuli which excite the brain, the adrenals, the liver, and the muscles to increased activity will also aggravate this disease. The function of the thyroid in the kinetic chain is best evidenced, however, by its role in the production of fever.  Fever results from the administration of thyroid extract alone in large doses. In the hyperactivity of the thyroid in exophthalmic goiter one sees a marked tendency to fever, in severe cases there is daily fever. In fact, in Graves' disease we find displayed to an extraordinary degree an exaggeration of the whole action of the kinetic mechanism. We have stated that in acute Graves' disease there is a tendency to the production of spontaneous fever, and that there is a magnified diurnal variation in temperature which is due to an increased output of energy in even the normal reaction producing consciousness.  In Graves' disease there is, therefore, a state of intensified consciousness, which is associated with low brain thresholds to all stimuli--both to stimuli that cause muscular action and to stimuli that cause fever.  The intensity of the kinetic discharge is seen in the constant fine tremor. It is evident that the thresholds of the brain have been sensitized. In this hypersensitization we find the following strong evidence as to the identity of the various mechanisms for the production of fever. In the state of superlative sensitization which is seen in Graves' disease we find that the stimuli that produce muscular movement, the stimuli that produce emotional phenomena, and the stimuli that produce fever are as nearly as can be ascertained equally effective. Clinical evidence regarding this point is abundant, for in patients with Graves' disease we find that the three types of conversion of energy resulting from emotional stimulation, from infection stimulation, and from nociceptor stimulation (pain), are, as nearly as can be judged, equally exaggerated. In the acute cases of Graves' disease the explosive conversion of latent energy into heat and motion is unexcelled by any other known normal or pathologic phenomenon.  Excessive thyroid secretion, as in thyrotoxicosis from functioning adenomata, and excessive thyroid feeding, cause all the phenomena of Graves' disease except the exophthalmos and the emotional facies (Figs. 15 and 23). The ligation of arteries, the division of its nerve supply, or the excision of part of the gland, may reverse the foregoing picture and restore the normal condition.  The patient notes the effect on the second day and often within a week is relatively quiescent. On the contrary, if there is thyroid deficiency there results the opposite state, a reptilian sluggishness. At will, then, through diminished, normal, or excessive administration of thyroid secretion, we may produce an adynamic, a normal, or an excessively dynamic state.  By the thyroid influence, the brain thresholds are lowered and life becomes exquisite; without its influence the brain becomes a globe of relatively inert substance.  Excessive doses of iodin alone cause most of the symptoms of Graves' disease.  As we have stated, the active constituent of the thyroid is iodin in a special protein combination which is stored in the colloidal spaces. Hence one would not expect to find changes in the cells of the thyroid gland as a result of increased activity unless it be prolonged. We have thus far considered the normal roles played by the brain, the adrenals the liver, the muscles, and the thyroid in transforming latent into kinetic energy in the form of heat and motion as an adaptive response to environmental stimuli. The argument may be strengthened, however, by the discussion of the effect of the impairment of any of these links in the kinetic chain upon the conversion of latent into kinetic energy. Effect Upon the Output of Energy of Impaired or Lost Function of Each of the Several Links in the Kinetic Chain (1) _The Brain_.--In cerebral softening we may find all the organs of the body comparatively healthy excepting the brain. As the brain is physically impaired it cannot normally stimulate other organs to the conversion of latent energy into heat or into motion, but, on the contrary, in these cases we find feeble muscular and intellectual power.  I believe also that in patients with cerebral softening, infections such as pneumonia show a lower temperature range than in patients whose brains are normal. (2) _The Adrenals_.--In such destructive lesions of the adrenals as Addison's disease one of the cardinal symptoms is a subnormal temperature and impaired muscular power.  Animals upon whom double adrenalectomy has been performed show a striking fall in temperature, muscular weakness,--after adrenalectomy the animal may not be able to stand even,--and progressive chromatolysis. (3) _The Liver_.--When the function of the liver is impaired by tumors, cirrhosis, or degeneration of the liver itself, then the entire energy of the body is correspondingly diminished. This diminution of energy is evidenced by muscular and mental weakness, by diminished response and by gradual loss of efficiency which finally reaches the state of asthenia. (4) _The Muscles_.--It has been observed clinically that if the muscles are impaired by long disuse, or by a disease such as myasthenia gravis, then the range of production of both heat and motion is below normal. This is in agreement with the experimental findings that anesthetics, curare, or any break in the muscle-brain connection causes diminished muscular and heat production. (5) _The Thyroid_.--In myxedema one of the cardinal symptoms is a persistently subnormal temperature and, though prone to infection, subjects of myxedema show but feeble febrile response and readily succumb.  This clinical observation is strikingly confirmed by laboratory observations; normal rabbits subjected to fear showed a rise in temperature of from one to three degrees, while two rabbits whose thyroids had been previously removed and who had then been subjected to fright showed much less febrile response. Myxedema subjects show a loss of physical and mental energy which is proportional to the lack of thyroid.  Deficiency in any of the organs of the kinetic chain causes alike loss of heat, loss of muscular and emotional action, of mental power, and of the power of combating infections--the negative evidence thus strongly supports the positive.  By accumulating all the evidence we believe we are justified in associating the brain, the adrenals, the thyroid, the muscles, and the liver as vital links in the kinetic chain. Other organs play a role undoubtedly, though a minor one. Studies in Hydrogen Ion Concentration in Activation of the Kinetic System Having established the identity of some, at least, of the organs which constitute the kinetic chain, we endeavored to secure still further evidence regarding the energy-transforming function of these organs by making studies of the H-ion concentration of the blood, as one would expect, _prima facie_, that the normal reaction would be altered by kinetic activation.[*] [*] The H-ion observations were made in my laboratory by Dr. M. L. Menten. H-ion concentration tests were made after the application of the adequate stimuli by which the function of the kinetic organs had been determined, and we studied also the effect upon the acidity of the blood of strychnin convulsions after destruction of the medulla; of deep narcotization with morphin before anesthesia; of deep narcotization with morphin after the H-ion concentration had already been increased by fear, by anger, by exertion, by injury under anesthesia, or by anesthesia alone. The complete data of these experiments will be later reported in a monograph; here it is sufficient to state that anger, fear, injury, muscular exertion, inhalation anesthesia, strychnin, alcohol, in fact, all the stimuli which we had already found to produce histologic changes in the brain, the adrenals, and the liver-excepting bacterial toxins--caused increased H-ion concentration. Of striking significance is the fact that morphin alone caused no change in the H-ion concentration, while if administered before the application of a stimulus which by itself produced increased H-ion concentration, the action of that stimulus was neutralized or postponed.  If, however, morphin was administered after increased acidity had been produced by any stimulus, or by inhalation anesthesia, then the time required for the restoration of the normal alkalinity was much prolonged, and in some instances the power of acid neutralization was permanently lost. After excision of the liver, the normal H-ion concentration was maintained for periods varying from one to several hours, after which the concentration (acidity) began to increase as the vitality of the animal began to decline, the concentration (acidity) increasing rapidly until death.  After excision of the adrenals the blood remained normal for from four to six hours, when the H-ion concentration increased rather suddenly, the increase being synchronous with the incidence of the phenomena which immediately preceded death. In none of these cases was it determined whether the increased H-ion concentration was due to other causes of death or whether death was due to the increased acidity. It is also significant that after the application of each of the adequate stimuli which increased the H-ion concentration of the blood in other parts of the body the blood from the adrenal vein showed a slight diminution in acidity, as, in most instances, did the blood from the hepatic vein also. In fact, the H-ion concentration of the blood in the adrenal vein was less than in the blood of any other part of the circulation. Kinetic Diseases If our conclusions are sound, then in the kinetic system we find an explanation of many diseases, and having found the explanation, we may find new methods of combating them. When the kinetic system is driven at an overwhelming rate of speed,-- as by severe physical injury, by intense emotional excitation, by perforation of the intestines, by the pointing of an abscess into new territory, by the sudden onset of an infectious disease, by an overdose of strychnin, by a Marathon race, by a grilling fight, by foreign proteins, by anaphylaxis,--the result of these acute overwhelming activations of the kinetic system is clinically designated shock, and according to the cause is called traumatic shock, toxic shock, anaphylactic shock, drug shock, etc. The essential pathology of shock is identical whatever the cause. If, however, instead of an intense overwhelming activation, the kinetic system is continuously or intermittently overstimulated through a considerable period of time, as long as each of the links in the kinetic chain takes the strain equally the result will be excessive energy conversion, excessive work done; but usually, under stress, some one link in the chain is unable to take the strain and then the evenly balanced work of the several organs of the kinetic system is disturbed.  If the brain cannot endure the strain, then neurasthenia, nerve exhaustion, or even insanity follows. If the thyroid cannot endure the strain, it undergoes hyperplasia, which in turn may result in a colloid goiter or in exophthalmic goiter. If the adrenals cannot endure the strain, cardiovascular disease may develop.  If the liver cannot take the strain, then death from acute acidosis may follow, or if the neutralizing effect of the liver is only partially lost, then the acidity may cause Bright's disease. Overactivation of the kinetic system may cause glycosuria and diabetes. Identical physical and functional changes in the organs of the kinetic system may result from intense continued stimulation from any of the following causes:  Excessive physical labor, athletic exercise, worry or anxiety, intestinal autointoxication, chronic infections, such as oral sepsis, tonsillitis, and adenoids; chronic appendicitis, chronic cholecystitis, colitis, and skin infections; the excessive intake of protein food (foreign protein reaction); emotional strain, pregnancy, stress of business or professional life-- all of which are known to be activators of the kinetic system. From the foregoing statements we are able to understand the muscular weakness following fever; we can understand why the senile have neither muscular power nor strong febrile reaction; why long-continued infections produce pathologic changes in the organs constituting the kinetic chain; why the same pathologic changes result from various forms of activation of the kinetic system. In this hypothesis we find a reason why cardiovascular disease may be caused by chronic infection, by auto-intoxication, by overwork, or by emotional excitation.  We now see that the reason why we find so much difficulty in differentiating the numerous acute infections from each other is because they play upon the same kinetic chain. Our postulate harmonizes the pathologic democracy of the kinetic organs, for it explains not only why, in many diseases, the pathologic changes in these organs are identical, but why the same changes are seen as the result of emotional strain and overwork. We can thus understand how either emotional strain or acute or chronic infection may cause either exophthalmic goiter or cardiovascular disease; how chronic intestinal stasis with the resultant absorption of toxins may cause cardiovascular disease, neurasthenia, or goiter. Here is found an explanation of the phenomena of shock, whether the shock be the result of toxins, of infection, of foreign proteins, of anaphylaxis, of psychic stimuli, or of a surgical operation with its combination of both psychic and traumatic elements. This conception of the kinetic system has stood a crucial test by making possible the shockless operation.  It has offered a plausible explanation of the cause and the treatment of Graves' disease.  Will the kinetic theory stand also the clinical test of controlling that protean disease bred in the midst of the stress of our present-day life? Present-day life, in which one must ever have one hand on the sword and the other on the throttle, is a constant stimulus of the kinetic system. The force of these kinetic stimuli may be lessened at the cerebral link by intelligent control--a protective control is empirically attained by many of the most successful men.  The force of the kinetic stimuli may be broken at the thyroid link by dividing the nerve supply, reducing the blood supply, or by partial excision; or if the adrenals feel the strain, the stimulating force may be broken by dividing their nerve supply, reducing the blood supply, or by partial excision. No theory is worth more than its yield in practice, but already we have the shockless operation, the surgical treatment of Graves' disease, and the control of shock and of the acute infections by overwhelming morphinization (Figs. 62, 72, and 73). Conclusions To become adapted to their environment animals are transformers of energy. This adaptation to environment is made by means of a system of organs evolved for the purpose of converting potential energy into heat and motion.  The principal organs and tissues of this system are the brain, the adrenals, the thyroid, the muscles, and the liver. Each is a vital link, each plays its particular role, and one cannot compensate for the other.  A change in any link of the kinetic chain modifies proportionately the entire kinetic system which is no stronger than its weakest link. In this conception we find a possible explanation of many diseases one which may point the way to new and more effective therapeutic measures than those now at our command. ALKALESCENCE, ACIDITY, ANESTHESIA--A THEORY OF ANESTHESIA[*] [*] Paper delivered before the Virginia Medical Association, Washington, D. C., October 29, 1914. Alkalis and bases compose the greater part of the food of man and animals, the blood in both man and animals under normal conditions being slightly alkaline or rather potentially alkaline; that is, although in circulating blood the concentration of the OH-ions-- upon which the degree of alkalinity depends--is but little more than in distilled water, yet blood has the power of neutralizing a considerable amount of acid (Starling, Wells). At the time of death, whatever its cause, the concentration of H-ions in the blood increases,-- the concentration of H-ions being a measure of acidity,--that is, the potential or actual alkalinity decreases and the blood becomes actually neutral or acid. To determine what conditions tend to diminish the normal alkalinity of the blood, many observations were made for me in my laboratory by Dr. M. L. Menten to determine by electric measurements the H-ion concentration of the blood under certain pathologic and physiologic conditions. As a result of these researches we are able to state that the H-ion concentration of the blood--its acidity--is increased by excessive muscular activity; excessive emotional excitation; surgical shock; in the late stages of infection; by asphyxia; by strychnin convulsions; by inhalation anesthetics; after excision of the pancreas, and in the late stages of life after excision of the liver and excision of the adrenals. Morphin and decapitation cause no change in the H-ion concentration. Ether, nitrous oxid, and alcohol produce an increased acidity of the blood which is proportional to the depth of anesthesia. Many of the cases studied were near death, as would be expected, since it is well known that a certain degree of acidity is incompatible with life. Since alkalis and bases preponderate in ingested food; since alkalinity of the blood is diminished by bodily activity; and since at the point of death the blood is always acid, we may infer that some mechanism or mechanisms of the body were evolved for the purpose of changing bases into acids that thus energy might be liberated. These observations lead naturally to the question, May not acidity of itself be the actual final cause of death? We believe that it may be so from the facts that--(1) The intravenous injection of certain acids causes death quickly, but that convulsions do not occur, since the voluntary muscles lose their power of contraction; and (2) the intravenous injection of acids causes extensive histologic changes in the brain, the adrenals, and the liver which resemble the changes invariably caused by activation of the kinetic system (Figs. 74 and 75). In view of these facts may we not find that anesthesia and many instances of unconsciousness are merely phenomena of acidity? As has been stated already, we have found that the H-ion concentration of the blood--its acidity--is increased by alcohol, by ether, and by nitrous oxid.  In addition our tests have shown that under ether the increase of the H-ion concentration--acidity--is more gradual than under nitrous oxid, an observation which accords well with the fact that nitrous oxid more quickly induces anesthesia than does ether. Further striking testimony in favor of the hypothesis that the production of acidity by inhalation anesthetics is the method by which anesthesia itself is produced is found in the fact that although lethal doses of acid cause muscular paralysis, yet this paralysis may be mitigated by adrenalin--which is alkaline. This observation may explain in part the remarkable success of the method of resuscitation devised by me, in which animals "killed" by anesthetics and asphyxia are revived by the use of adrenalin. In animals under inhalation anesthesia Williams found that no nerve-current could be detected by the Einthoven string galvanometer, a fact which might be explained by postulating that nerve-currents can flow from the brain to the muscles and glands only when there is a difference of potential.  Any variation from the normal alkalinity of the body must change the difference in potential. Since the nerve-currents in animals under anesthesia are not demonstrable by any apparatus at our command, and since anesthesia produces acidity, then we may infer that acidity reduces the difference in potential. As long as there is life, a galvanometer of sufficient delicacy would perforce detect, a nerve-current until the acidity increased to such a point as to reduce the difference in potential to zero-- the point of death.  If at this point a suitable alkali-- adrenalin solution--can be introduced quickly enough, the vital difference in potential may be restored and the life processes will be renewed. Bearing especially on this point is the fact that if adrenalin in sufficient quantities be administered simultaneously with an acid, it will not only prevent the fall in blood-pressure usually caused by the acid, but will also prevent the histologic changes in the brain, adrenals, and liver which are usually caused by the intravenous injection of acids. This hypothesis regarding the cause of anesthesia and unconsciousness explains and harmonizes many facts.  It explains how asphyxia, overwhelming emotion, and excessive muscular exertion, by causing acidity, may produce unconsciousness.  It explains the acidosis which results from starvation, from uremia, from diabetes, from Bright's disease, and supplies a reason for the use of intravenous infusions of sodium bicarbonate to overcome the coma of diabetes and uremia (Fig. 76). It may explain the quick death from chloroform and nitrous oxid; and may perhaps show why unconsciousness is so commonly the immediate precursor of death. One of the most noticeable immediate effects of the administration of an inhalation anesthetic is a marked increase in the rapidity and force of the respiration.  The respiratory center has evidently been evolved to act with an increase of vigor which is proportional-- within certain limits--to the increase in the H-ion concentration, whereas the centers governing the voluntary muscles are inhibited. In this antithetic reaction of the higher cortical centers and the lower centers in the medulla to acidity we find a remarkable adaptation which prevents the animal from killing itself by the further increase in acidity which would be produced by muscular activity.  That is, as the acidity produced by muscular action increases and threatens life, the respiratory action, by which carbon dioxid is eliminated and oxygen supplied, is increased, while the driving power of the brain, which produces acidity, is diminished or even inhibited entirely; that is, the state of unconsciousness or anesthesia is reached. We conclude first that, without this life-saving regulation, animals under stress would inevitably commit suicide; and, second, that it is probable that the remarkable phenomenon of anesthesia-- the coincident existence of unconsciousness and life--is due to this antithetic action of the cortex and the medulla. In the human, as in the animal, the degree of acidity parallels the depth of inhalation anesthesia. Within a few seconds after beginning nitrous oxid anesthesia the acidity of the blood is increased.  This rapid acidulation is synchronous with almost instantaneous unconsciousness and increased respiration. If the oxygen in the inhaled mixture be increased, a decrease in acidity is again synchronous with lighter anesthesia and a decrease in the respiratory rate. If these premises be sound, we are justified in asserting that the state of anesthesia is due to an induced acidity of the blood.  If the acidity is slight, then the anesthesia is slight and the force of the nerve impulses is lessened, but the patient is still conscious of them. As the acidity increases associative memory is lost, and the patient is said to be unconscious:  the centers governing the voluntary muscles are not inhibited, however, and cutting the skin causes movements. If the acidity is further increased, there is loss of muscular tone and even the strong contact ceptor stimuli of a surgical operation do not cause any muscular response, and, finally, the acidity may be increased to the point at which the respiratory and circulatory centers can no longer respond by increased effort, and anesthetic death-- that is, ACID death--follows. Certain clinical phenomena are clarified by this theory and serve to substantiate it.  For example, it is well known that inhalation anesthesia precipitates the impending acidosis which results from starvation, from extreme Graves' disease, from great exhaustion, from surgical shock, and from hemorrhage, and which is present when death from any cause is imminent. We see, therefore, that anesthesia is made possible, first, by the fact that inhalation anesthetics cause acidity, and, second, by the antithetic adaptation of the higher centers in the brain and of the centers governing respiration and circulation. In deep contrast to the action of inhalation anesthetics is that of narcotics.  Deep narcotization with morphin and scopolamin is induced slowly; the respiratory and pulse-rate are progressively lessened-- and there is no acidity. By our researches we have established in what consists the generic difference between inhalation anesthetics and narcotics. In our experiments no increase in the H-ion concentration was produced by morphin or by scopolamin, no matter how deep the narcotization. In animals already narcotized by morphin the production of acid by any of the acid-producing stimuli was delayed or prevented.  On the other hand, in animals in which an acidity had already been produced by ether, by shock, by anger, or by fear, the later administration of morphin delayed or inhibited entirely the neutralization of the acidity. In other words, morphin interferes with the normal mechanism by which acidity is neutralized possibly because its inhibiting action on the respiratory center is sufficient to overcome the stimulating action of acidity on that center, for, as we have stated, the neutralization of acidity is in large measure accomplished by the increased respiration induced by the acidity itself. SUMMARY Acidity inhibits the functions of the cerebral cortex, but stimulates those of the medulla.  This antithetic reaction to the stimulus of increased H-ion concentration is an adaptation to prevent animals from committing suicide by over-activity, for the mechanism for the initiation and control of the transformation of energy is in the higher centers of the brain, while an essential part of the mechanism for the neutralization of acidity--the centers governing circulation and respiration-- is in the medulla.  This explains many clinical phenomena-- why excessive acidity causes paralysis, why there is great thirst after inhalation anesthesia, after excessive muscular activity, excessive emotion--after all those activities which we have found to be acid-producing, for water, like air, neutralizes acids. The excessive use of alcohol, anesthetics, excessive work, intense emotion, all produce lesions of the kidney and of the liver. The explanation is found in the fact that all these stimuli increase the acidity of the blood.  and that, if long continued, the neutralizing mechanism must be broken down and so the end-products of metabolism are insufficiently prepared for elimination. In view of these considerations we may well conclude that the maintenance of the normal potential alkalinity of the blood is to be estimated as the keystone of the foundation of life itself.

The Letter of Paul  to the Ephesians 1 	1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the  saints who are in Ephesus and faithful in Christ Jesus: 2 grace and peace  to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.  	3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who  has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in  Christ, 4 just as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world,  that we would be holy and blameless before him. In love 5 he predestined  us to be adopted as his sons through Jesus Christ, according to the good  pleasure of his will, 6 to the praise of his glorious grace, which he freely  bestowed on us in the Beloved. 7 In him we have redemption through his  blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his  grace 8 which he lavished on us. In all wisdom and insight 9 he made  known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which  he purposed in Christ, 10 as a plan for the fullness of the times, to unite  all things in Christ, things in heaven and things on earth. In him 11 also  we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the  purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his will, 12 in  order that we, who were the first to hope in Christ, would be for the  praise of his glory. 13 In him, you also have heard the word of truth, the  gospel of your salvation. Having also believed, you were sealed in him  with the promised Holy Spirit, 14 who is a deposit guaranteeing our  inheritance, until the redemption of those who are God's possessionto  the praise of his glory.  	15 For this reason, ever since I heard of your faith in the Lord  Jesus and your love for all the saints, 16 I do not cease giving thanks for  you, remembering you in my prayers, 17 that the God of our Lord Jesus  Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and of  revelation in the knowledge of him. 18 I pray also that the eyes of your  heart may be enlightened, so that you may know what is the hope to  which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance in  the saints, 19 and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power in us  who believe. These are in accordance with the working of the strength of  his might 20 which he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead  and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, 21 far above all  rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is  named, not only in this age but also in the one to come. 22 And he put all  things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things for the  church, 23 which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.  2 	1 And you were dead in your trespasses and sins, 2 in which you  formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the  prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of  disobedience. 3 Among them we all once lived in the lusts of our flesh,  following the desires of flesh and mind, and so we were by nature  children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. 4 But God, who is rich in  mercy, because of his great love with which he loved us, 5 even when we  were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by  grace you have been saved), 6 and raised us up with him, and seated us  with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, 7 so that in the coming  ages he might show the surpassing riches of his grace in kindness toward  us in Christ Jesus. 8 For by grace you have been saved through faith; and  this is not of yourselves, it is the gift of God9 not as a result of works,  so that no one may boast. 10 For we are his workmanship, created in  Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we  would walk in them.  	11 Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the  flesh, who are called "Uncircumcision" by the so-called "Circumcision,"  which is performed in the flesh by human hands12 remember that you  were at that time separate from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth  of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and  without God in the world. 13 But now in Christ Jesus you who once were  far off have been brought near in the blood of Christ.  	14 For he himself is our peace, who has made us both one and  has broken down the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility, 15 by  abolishing in his flesh the hostility, which is the Law of commandments  and ordinances, so that he might create in himself one new man out of the  two, thus making peace, 16 and might reconcile them both to God in one  body through the cross, by which he put to death the hostility. 17 And he  came and preached peace to you who were far away, and peace to those  who were near; 18 for through him we both have our access in one Spirit  to the Father. 19 So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you  are fellow citizens with the saints, and are members of God's household,  20 having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets,  Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone, 21 in whom the whole  building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord;  22 in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling of God in  the Spirit.  3 	1 For this reason I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the  sake of you Gentiles2 assuming that you have heard of the stewardship  of God's grace that was given to me for you, 3 that is, the mystery made  known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly. 4 When you  read this, you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, 5  which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations as it  has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit; 6  that is, how the Gentiles are fellow heirs and members of the same body,  and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel. 7 Of this  gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God's grace which  was given me by the working of his power. 8 To me, though I am the very  least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the  unsearchable riches of Christ, 9 and to make plain to everyone the  administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God who  created all things; 10 so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be  made known through the church to the rulers and authorities in the  heavenly places. 11 This was according to the eternal purpose which he  carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord, 12 in whom we have boldness and  confidence of access through our faith in him. 13 Therefore I ask you not  to lose heart at my tribulations for you, which are your glory.  	14 For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, 15 from  whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name, 16 that  according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened  with power through his Spirit in the inner man, 17 so that Christ may  dwell in your hearts through faith; and that you, being rooted and  grounded in love, 18 may have power to comprehend with all the saints  what is the breadth and length and height and depth, 19 and to know the  love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all  the fullness of God.  	20 Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all  that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us, 21 to  him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, for ever  and ever. Amen.  4 	1 I therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, beg you to lead a life  worthy of the calling to which you have been called, 2 with all humility  and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love,  3 being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. 4  There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to the one hope  that belongs to your call, 5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism, 6 one God  and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.  	7 But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure  of Christ's gift. 8 Therefore it says,  	"When he ascended on high, he led a host of captives,  		and he gave gifts to men." 	9 (In saying, "He ascended," what does it mean except that he  had also descended into the lower parts of the earth? 10 He who  descended is also he who ascended far above all the heavens, so that he  might fill all things.) 11 And he gave some to be apostles, some prophets,  some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, 12 to equip the saints for the  work of service, for the building up of the body of Christ; 13 until we all  attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to  become mature, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. 14  As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by  waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the cunning of  men, by their craftiness in deceitful scheming. 15 But speaking the truth  in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into him, who is the head, into  Christ, 16 from whom the whole body, being joined and held together by  what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each part,  causes the growth of the body and builds itself up in love.  	17 Now this I affirm and testify in the Lord, that you must no  longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their minds, 18 they are  darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of  the ignorance that is in them, due to the hardness of their heart; 19 and  they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality,  greedy for the practice of every kind of impurity. 20 But you did not learn  Christ in this way, 21 assuming that you have heard about him and were  taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus. 22 You were taught, with regard to  your former manner of life, to put off your old self, which is being  corrupted by its deceitful lusts; 23 and be renewed in the spirit of your  minds, 24 and put on the new nature, created after the likeness of God in  true righteousness and holiness.  	25 Therefore, laying aside falsehood, each one of you must  speak truth with his neighbor, for we are members of one another. 26 Be  angry, and yet do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, 27  and do not give the devil an opportunity. 28 He who has been stealing  must steal no longer, but rather must labor, doing useful work with his  own hands, so that he may have something to share with those in need. 29  Let no unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is  good for building others up according to the need of the moment, that it  may impart grace to those who hear. 30 And do not grieve the Holy Spirit  of God, in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. 31 Let all  bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from  you, along with all malice. 32 Be kind and tenderhearted to one another,  forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.  5 1 Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children; 2 and walk in love,  just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering  and sacrifice to God. 3 But immorality or any impurity or greed must not  even be named among you, as is proper among saints. 4 And there must be  no filthiness and silly talk, or coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but  rather let there be thanksgiving. 5 For of this you can be sure, that no  immoral, impure, or covetous personsuch a man is an idolaterhas any  inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.  	6 Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these  things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. 7  Therefore do not be partners with them; 8 for once you were darkness, but  now you are light in the Lord; walk as children of light 9 (for the fruit of  the light consists in all goodness and righteousness and truth), 10 and try  to learn what is pleasing to the Lord. 11 Do not participate in the  unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead expose them. 12 For it is a  shame even to speak of the things that they do in secret. 13 But all things  become visible when they are exposed by the light, for everything that  becomes visible is light. 14 For this reason it is said,  	"Awake, O sleeper,  		and arise from the dead,  	and Christ will shine on you." 	15 Be careful, then, how you walk, not as unwise men, but as  wise, 16 making the most of your time, because the days are evil. 17  Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.  18 And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery; but be filled  with the Spirit, 19 speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and  spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord,  20 always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of  our Lord Jesus Christ.  	21 Be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ. 22  Wives, be subject to your husbands, as to the Lord. 23 For the husband is  the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of  which he is himself the Savior. 24 As the church is subject to Christ, so  let wives also be subject to their husbands in everything. 25 Husbands,  love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for  her, 26 that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of  water with the word, 27 that he might present the church to himself in all  her glory, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be  holy and blameless. 28 So husbands ought also to love their wives as their  own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. 29 For no one ever  hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also  does the church, 30 because we are members of his body. 31 "For this  reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife,  and the two shall become one flesh." 32 This is a profound mystery; but I  am saying that it refers to Christ and the church. 33 However, each one of  you must also love his wife as himself, and the wife must see that she  respects her husband.  6 	1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. 2  "Honor your father and mother" (which is the first commandment with a  promise), 3 "that it may be well with you and that you may live long on  the earth." 4 Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring  them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.  	5 Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to  the flesh, with fear and trembling, in sincerity of heart, as to Christ; 6 not  in the way of eye-service, as men-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing  the will of God from the heart. 7 Render service with good will, as to the  Lord, and not to men, 8 knowing that whatever good thing each one does,  this he will receive back from the Lord, whether he is a slave or free. 9  Masters, do the same to them, and give up threatening, knowing that he  who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and that there is no  partiality with him.  	10 Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might.  11 Put on the full armor of God, so that you may be able to stand against  the schemes of the devil. 12 For our struggle is not against flesh and  blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces  of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly  places. 13 Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you may be  able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm. 14  Stand firm therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put  on the breastplate of righteousness, 15 and having shod your feet with the  preparation of the gospel of peace; 16 in addition to all this, taking up the  shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of  the evil one. 17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the  spirit, which is the word of God. 18 Pray at all times in the Spirit, with all  prayer and petition. And with this in view, keep alert with all  perseverance and petition for all the saints, 19 and also pray for me, that  in the opening of my mouth, utterance may be given me so that I will  fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel, 20 for which I am an  ambassador in chains; that I may declare it boldly, as I ought to speak.  	21 Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the  Lord, will tell you everything, so that you also may know how I am and  what I am doing. 22 I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you  may know how we are, and that he may encourage your hearts.  	23 Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the  Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 24 Grace be with all who love our Lord  Jesus Christ with an undying love.

Prepared by David Reed haradda@aol.com or davidr@inconnect.com Faust Part 1 by Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe INTRODUCTORY NOTE JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE, the greatest of German men of letters, was born at Frank fort-on-the-Main, August 28, 1749. His father was a man of means and position, and he personally supervised the early education of his son. The young Goethe studied at the universities of Leipsic and Strasburg, and in 1772 entered upon the practise of law at Wetzlar. At the invitation of Karl August, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, he went in 1775 to live in Weimar, where he held a succession of political offices, becoming the Duke's chief adviser. From 1786 to 1788 he traveled in Italy, and from 179' to 1817 directed the ducal theater at Weimar. He took part in the wars against France, 1792-3, and in the following year began his friendship with Schiller, which lasted till the latter's death in 1805. In 1806 he married Christiane Vulpius. From about 1794 he devoted himself chiefly to literature, and after a life of extraordinary productiveness died at Weimar, March 22, 1832. The most important of Goethe's works produced before he went to Weimar were his tragedy "Gotz von Berlichingen" (1773), which first brought him fame, and "The Sorrows of Young Werther," a novel which obtained enormous popularity during the so-called "Sturm und Drang" period. During the years at Weimar before he knew Schiller he began "Wilhelm Meister," wrote the dramas, "Iphigenie," "Egmont," and "Torquato Tasso," and his "Reinecke Fuchs." To the period of his friendship with Schiller belong the continuation of "Wilhelm Meister," the beautiful idyl of "Hermann and Dorothea," and the "Roman Elegies." In the last period, between Schiller's death in 1805 and his own, appeared "Faust," "Elective Affinities," his autobiographical "Dichtung und Wahrheit" ("Poetry and Truth"), his "Italian Journey," much scientific work, and a series of treatises on German Art. Though the foregoing enumeration contains but a selection front the titles of Goethe's best known writings, it suffices to show the extraordinary fertility and versatility of his genius. Rarely has a man of letters had so full and varied a life, or been capable of so many-sided a development. His political and scientific activities, though dwarfed in the eyes of our generation by his artistic production, yet showed the adaptability of his talent in the most diverse directions, and helped to give him that balance of temper and breadth of vision in which he has been surpassed by no genius of the ancient or modern world. The greatest and most representative expression of Goethe's powers is without doubt to be found in his drama of "Faust"; but before dealing with Goethe's masterpiece, it is worth while to say something of the history of the story on which it is founded--the most famous instance of the old and widespread legend of the man who sold his soul to the devil. The historical Dr. Faust seems to have been a self-called philosopher who traveled about Germany in the first half of the sixteenth century, making money by the practise of magic, fortune-telling, and pretended cures. He died mysteriously about 1540, and a legend soon sprang up that the devil, by whose aid he wrought his wonders, had finally carried him off. In 1587 a life of him appeared, in which are attributed to him many marvelous exploits and in which he is held up as an awful warning against the excessive desire for secular learning and admiration for antique beauty which characterized the humanist movement of the time. In this aspect the Faust legend is an expression of early popular Protestantism, and of its antagonism to the scientific and classical tendencies of the Renaissance. While a succession of Faust books were appearing in Germany, the original life was translated into English and dramatized by Marlowe. English players brought Marlowe's work back to Germany, where it was copied by German actors, degenerated into spectacular farce, and finally into a puppet show. Through this puppet show Goethe made acquaintance with the legend. By the time that Goethe was twenty, the Faust legend had fascinated his imagination; for three years before he went to Weimar he had been working on scattered scenes and bits of dialogue; and though he suspended actual composition on it during three distinct periods, it was always to resume, and he closed his labors upon it only with his life. Thus the period of time between his first experiments and the final touches is more than sixty years. During this period the plans for the structure and the signification of the work inevitably underwent profound modifications, and these have naturally affected the unity of the result; but, on the other hand, this long companionship and persistent recurrence to the task from youth to old age have made it in a unique way the record of Goethe's personality in all its richness and diversity. The drama was given to the public first as a fragment in 1790; then the completed First Part appeared in 1808; and finally the Second Part was published in 1833, the year after the author's death. Writing in "Dichtung und Wahrheit" of the period about 1770, when he was in Strasburg with. Herder, Goethe says, "The significant puppet-play legend . . . echoed and buzzed in many tones within me. I too had drifted about in all knowledge, and early enough had been brought to feel the vanity of it. I too had made all sorts of experiments in life, and had always come back more unsatisfied and more tormented. I was now carrying these things, like many others, about with me and delighting myself with them in lonely hours, but without writing anything down." Without going into the details of the experience which underlies these words, we can see the be ginning of that sympathy with the hero of the old story that was the basis of its fascination and that accounted for Goethe's departure from the traditional catastrophe of Faust's damnation. Of the elements in the finished Faust that are derived from the legend a rough idea may be obtained from the "Doctor Faustus" of Marlowe, printed in the present volume. As early as 1674 a life of Faust had contained the incident of the philosopher's falling in love with a servant-girl; but the developed story of Gretchen is Goethe's own. The other elements added to the plot can be noted by a comparison with Marlowe. It need hardly be said that Goethe's "Faust" does not derive its greatness from its conformity to the traditional standards of what a tragedy should be. He himself was accustomed to refer to it cynically as a monstrosity, and yet he put himself into it as intensely as Dante put himself into "The Divine Comedy." A partial explanation of this apparent contradiction in the author's attitude is to be found in what has been said of its manner of composition. Goethe began it in his romantic youth, and availed himself recklessly of the supernatural elements in the legend, with the disregard of reason and plausibility characteristic of the romantic mood. When he returned to it in the beginning of the new century his artistic standards had changed, and the supernaturalism could now be tolerated only by being made symbolic. Thus he makes the career of Faust as a whole emblematic of the triumph of the persistent striving for the ideal over the temptation to find complete satisfaction in the sense, and prepares the reader for this interpretation by prefixing the "Prologue in Heaven." The elaboration of this symbolic element is responsible for such scenes as the Walpurgis Night and the Intermezzo, scenes full of power and infinitely suggestive, but destructive of the unity of the play as a tragedy of human life. Yet there remains in this First Part even in its final form much that is realistic in the best sense, the carousal in Auerbach's cellar, the portrait of Martha, the Easter-morning walk, the character and fate of Margaret. It is such elements as these that have appealed to the larger reading public and that have naturally been emphasized by performance on the stage, and by virtue of these alone "Faust" may rank as a great drama; but it is the result of Goethe's broodings on the mystery of human life, shadowed forth in the symbolic parts and elaborated with still greater complexity and still more far-reaching suggestiveness--and, it must be added, with deepening obscurity--in the Second Part, that have given the work its place with "Job," with the "Prometheus Bound," with "The Divine Comedy," and with "Hamlet." Dedication YE wavering shapes, again ye do enfold me, As erst upon my troubled sight ye stole; Shall I this time attempt to clasp, to hold ye? Still for the fond illusion yearns my soul? Ye press around! Come then, your captive hold me, As upward from the vapoury mist ye roll; Within my breast youth's throbbing pulse is bounding, Fann'd by the magic breath your march surrounding. Shades fondly loved appear, your train attending, And visions fair of many a blissful day; First-love and friendship their fond accents blending, Like to some ancient, half-expiring lay; Sorrow revives, her wail of anguish sending Back o'er life's devious labyrinthine way, And names the dear ones, they whom Fate bereaving Of life's fair hours, left me behind them grieving. They hear me not my later cadence singing, The souls to whom my earlier lays I sang; Dispersed the throng, their severed flight now winging; Mute are the voices that responsive rang. For stranger crowds the Orphean lyre now stringing, E'en their applause is to my heart a pang; Of old who listened to my song, glad hearted, If yet they live, now wander widely parted. A yearning long unfelt, each impulse swaying, To yon calm spirit-realm uplifts my soul; In faltering cadence, as when Zephyr playing, Fans the Aeolian harp, my numbers roll; Tear follows tear, my steadfast heart obeying The tender impulse, loses its control; What I possess as from afar I see; Those I have lost become realities to me. PROLOGUE FOR THE THEATRE MANAGER.  DRAMATIC POET.  MERRYMAN. MANAGER YE twain, in trouble and distress True friends whom I so oft have found, Say, for our scheme on German ground, What prospect have we of success? Fain would I please the public, win their thanks; They live and let live, hence it is but meet. The posts are now erected, and the planks, And all look forward to a festal treat. Their places taken, they, with eyebrows rais'd, Sit patiently, and fain would be amaz'd. I know the art to hit the public taste, Yet ne'er of failure felt so keen a dread; True, they are not accustomed to the best, But then appalling the amount they've read.. How make our entertainment striking, new, And yet significant and pleasing too? For to be plain, I love to see the throng, As to our booth the living tide progresses; As wave on wave successive rolls along, And through heaven's narrow portal forceful presses; Still in broad daylight, ere the clock strikes four, With blows their way towards the box they take; And, as for bread in famine, at the baker's door, For tickets are content their necks to break. Such various minds the bard alone can sway, My friend, oh work this miracle to-day! POET Oh of the motley throng speak not before me, At whose aspect the Spirit wings its flight! Conceal the surging concourse, I implore thee, Whose vortex draws us with resistless might. No, to some peaceful heavenly nook restore me, Where only for the bard blooms pure delight, Where love and friendship yield their choicest blessing, Our heart's true bliss, with god-like hand caressing. What in the spirit's depths was there created, What shyly there the lip shaped forth in sound; A failure now, with words now fitly mated, In the wild tumult of the hour is drown'd; Full oft the poet's thought for years bath waited Until at length with perfect form 'tis crowned; What dazzles, for the moment born, must perish; What genuine is posterity will cherish. MERRYMAN This cant about posterity I hate; About posterity were I to prate, Who then the living would amuse? For they Will have diversion, ay, and 'tis their due. A sprightly fellow's presence at your play, Methinks should also count for something too; Whose genial wit the audience still inspires, Knows from their changeful mood no angry feeling; A wider circle he desires, To their heart's depths more surely thus appealing. To work, then! Give a master-piece, my friend; Bring Fancy with her choral trains before us, Sense, reason, feeling, passion, but attend! Let folly also swell the tragic chorus. MANAGER In chief, of incident enough prepare! A show they want, they come to gape and stare. Spin for their eyes abundant occupation, SO that the multitude may wondering gaze, You by sheer bulk have won your reputation, By mass alone can you subdue the masses, Each then selects in time what suits his bent. Bring much, you something bring for various classes, And from the house goes every one content. You give a piece, abroad in pieces send it! 'Tis a ragout--success most needs attend it; 'Tis easy to serve up, as easy to invent. A finish'd whole what boots it to present! Full soon the public will in pieces rend it. POET How mean such handicraft as this you cannot feel! How it revolts the genuine artist's mind! The sorry trash in which these coxcombs deal, Is here approved on principle, I find. MANAGER Such a reproof disturbs me not a whit! Who on efficient work is bent, Must choose the fittest instrument. Consider! 'tis soft wood you have to split; Think too for whom you write, I pray! One comes to while an hour away; One from the festive board, a sated guest; Others, more dreaded than the rest, From journal-reading hurry to the play. As to a masquerade, with absent minds, they press, Sheer curiosity their footsteps winging; Ladies display their persons and their dress, Actors unpaid their service bringing. What dreams beguile you on your poet's height? What puts a full house in a merry mood? More closely view your patrons of the night! The half are cold, the half are rude. One, the play over, craves a game of cards; Another a wild night in wanton joy would spend. Poor fools the muses' fair regards. Why court for such a paltry end? I tell you, give them more, still more, 'tis all I ask, Thus you will ne'er stray widely from the goal; Your audience seek to mystify, cajole;-- To satisfy them--that's a harder task. What ails thee? art enraptured or distressed? POET Depart! elsewhere another servant choose What! shall the bard his godlike power abuse? Man's loftiest right, kind nature's high bequest, For your mean purpose basely sport away? Whence comes his mastery o'er the human breast, Whence o'er the elements his sway, But from the harmony that, gushing from his soul, Draws back into his heart the wondrous whole? With careless hand when round her spindle, Nature Winds the interminable thread of life; When 'mid the clash of Being every creature Mingles in harsh inextricable strife; Who deals their course unvaried till it falleth, In rhythmic flow to music's measur'd tone? Each solitary note whose genius calleth, To swell the mighty choir in unison? Who in the raging storm sees passion low'ring? Or flush of earnest thought in evening's glow? Who every blossom in sweet spring-time flowering Along the loved one's path would strow? Who, Nature's green familiar leaves entwining, Wreathe's glory's garland, won on every field? Makes sure Olympus, heavenly powers combining? Man's mighty spirit, in the bard reveal'd! MERRYMAN Come then, employ your lofty inspiration, And carry on the poet's avocation, Just as we carry on a love affair. Two meet by chance, are pleased, they linger there, Insensibly are link'd, they scarce know how; Fortune seems now propitious, adverse now, Then come alternate rapture and despair; And 'tis a true romance ere one's aware. Just such a drama let us now compose. Plunge boldly into life--its depths disclose! Each lives it, not to many is it known, 'Twill interest wheresoever seiz'd and shown; Bright pictures, but obscure their meaning: A ray of truth through error gleaming, Thus you the best elixir brew, To charm mankind, and edify them too. Then youth's fair blossoms crowd to view your play, And wait as on an oracle; while they, The tender souls, who love the melting mood, Suck from your work their melancholy food; Now this one, and now that, you deeply stir, Each sees the working of his heart laid bare. Their tears, their laughter, you command with ease, The lofty still they honour, the illusive love. Your finish'd gentlemen you ne'er can please; A growing mind alone will grateful prove. POET Then give me back youth's golden prime, When my own spirit too was growing, When from my heart th' unbidden rhyme Gush'd forth, a fount for ever flowing; Then shadowy mist the world conceal'd, And every bud sweet promise made, Of wonders yet to be reveal'd, As through the vales, with blooms inlaid, Culling a thousand flowers I stray'd. Naught had I, yet a rich profusion! The thirst for truth, joy in each fond illusion. Give me unquell'd those impulses to prove;-- Rapture so deep, its ecstasy was pain, The power of hate, the energy of love, Give me, oh give me back my youth again! MERRYMAN Youth, my good friend, you certainly require When foes in battle round are pressing, When a fair maid, her heart on fire, Hangs on your neck with fond caressing, When from afar, the victor's crown, To reach the hard-won goal inciteth; When from the whirling dance, to drown Your sense, the night's carouse inviteth. But the familiar chords among Boldly to sweep, with graceful cunning, While to its goal, the verse along Its winding path is sweetly running; This task is yours, old gentlemen, to-day; Nor are you therefore less in reverence held; Age does not make us childish, as folk say, It finds us genuine children e'en in eld. MANAGER A truce to words, mere empty sound, Let deeds at length appear, my friends! While idle compliments you round, You might achieve some useful ends. Why talk of the poetic vein? Who hesitates will never know it; If bards ye are, as ye maintain, Now let your inspiration show it. To you is known what we require, Strong drink to sip is our desire; Come, brew me such without delay! To-morrow sees undone, what happens not to-day Still forward press, nor ever tire! The possible, with steadfast trust, Resolve should by the forelock grasp; Then she will ne'er let go her clasp, And labours on, because she must. Therefore in bringing out your play, Nor scenes nor mechanism spare! Heaven's lamps employ, the greatest and the least, Be lavish of the stellar lights, Water, and fire, and rocky heights, Spare not at all, nor birds, nor beast. Thus let creation's ample sphere Forthwith in this our narrow booth appear, And with considerate speed, through fancy's spell, Journey from heaven, thence through the world, to hell! PROLOGUE IN HEAVEN THE LORD. THE HEAVENLY HOSTS. Afterwards MEPHISTOPHELES. Time three Archangels come forward RAPHAEL THE Sun, in ancient guise, competing With brother spheres in rival song, With thunder-march, his orb completing, Moves his predestin'd course along; His aspect to the powers supernal Gives strength, though fathom him none may; Transcending thought, the works eternal Are fair as on the primal day. GABRIEL With speed, thought baffling, unabating, Earth's splendour whirls in circling flight; Its Eden-brightness alternating With solemn, awe-inspiring night; Ocean's broad waves in wild commotion, Against the rocks' deep base are hurled; And with the spheres, both rock and ocean Eternally are swiftly whirled. MICHAEL And tempests roar in emulation From sea to land, from land to sea, And raging form, without cessation, A chain of wondrous agency, Full in the thunder's path careering, Flaring the swift destructions play; But, Lord, Thy servants are revering The mild procession of thy day. THE THREE Thine aspect to the powers supernal Gives strength, though fathom thee none may; And all thy works, sublime, eternal, Are fair as on the primal day. MEPHISTOPHELES Since thou, O Lord, approachest us once more, And how it fares with us, to ask art fain, Since thou hast kindly welcom'd me of yore, Thou see'st me also now among thy train. Excuse me, fine harangues I cannot make, Though all the circle look on me with scorn; My pathos soon thy laughter would awake, Hadst thou the laughing mood not long forsworn. Of suns and worlds I nothing have to say, I see alone mankind's self-torturing pains. The little world-god still the self-same stamp retains, And is as wondrous now as on the primal day. Better he might have fared, poor wight, Hadst thou not given him a gleam of heavenly light; Reason, he names it, and doth so Use it, than brutes more brutish still to grow. With deference to your grace, he seems to me Like any long-legged grasshopper to be, Which ever flies, and flying springs, And in the grass its ancient ditty sings. Would he but always in the grass repose! In every heap of dung he thrusts his nose. THE LORD Hast thou naught else to say? Is blame In coming here, as ever, thy sole aim? Does nothing on the earth to thee seem right? MEPHISTOPHELES No, Lord! I find things there, as ever, in sad plight. Men, in their evil days, move my compassion; Such sorry things to plague is nothing worth. THE LORD Know'st thou my servant, Faust? MEPHISTOPHELES The doctor? THE LORD Right. MEPHISTOPHELES He serves thee truly in a wondrous fashion. Poor fool! His food and drink are not of earth. An inward impulse hurries him afar, Himself half conscious of his frenzied mood; From heaven claimeth he the fairest star, And from the earth craves every highest good, And all that's near, and all that's far, Fails to allay the tumult in his blood. THE LORD Though in perplexity he serves me now, I soon will lead him where more light appears; When buds the sapling, doth the gardener know That flowers and fruit will deck the coming years. MEPHISTOPHELES What wilt thou wager? Him thou yet shall lose, If leave to me thou wilt but give, Gently to lead him as I choose! THE LORD So long as he on earth doth live, So long 'tis not forbidden thee. Man still must err, while he doth strive. MEPHISTOPHELES I thank you; for not willingly I traffic with the dead, and still aver That youth's plump blooming cheek I very much prefer. I'm not at home to corpses; 'tis my way, Like cats with captive mice to toy and play. THE LORD Enough! 'tis granted thee! Divert This mortal spirit from his primal source; Him, canst thou seize, thy power exert And lead him on thy downward course, Then stand abash'd, when thou perforce must own, A good man in his darkest aberration, Of the right path is conscious still. MEPHISTOPHELES 'Tis done! Full soon thou'lt see my exultation; As for my bet no fears I entertain. And if my end I finally should gain, Excuse my triumphing with all my soul. Dust he shall eat, ay, and with relish take, As did my cousin, the renowned snake. THE LORD Here too thou'rt free to act without control; I ne'er have cherished hate for such as thee. Of all the spirits who deny, The scoffer is least wearisome to me. Ever too prone is man activity to shirk, In unconditioned rest he fain would live; Hence this companion purposely I give, Who stirs, excites, and must, as devil, work. But ye, the genuine sons of heaven, rejoice! In the full living beauty still rejoice! May that which works and lives, the ever-growing, In bonds of love enfold you, mercy-fraught, And Seeming's changeful forms, around you flowing, Do ye arrest, in ever-during thought! (Heaven closes, the Archangels disperse.) MEPHISTOPHELES (alone) The ancient one I like sometimes to see, And not to break with him am always civil; 'Tis courteous in so great a lord as he, To speak so kindly even to the devil.

In the Intermezzo OBERON. TITANIA. ARIEL. PUCK, &C, &C. PART I NIGHT A high vaulted narrow Gothic chamber. FAUST, restless, seated at his desk. FAUST I HAVE, alas! Philosophy, Medicine, Jurisprudence too, And to my cost Theology, With ardent labour, studied through. And here I stand, with all my lore, Poor fool, no wiser than before. Magister, doctor styled, indeed, Already these ten years I lead, Up, down, across, and to and fro, My pupils by the nose,--and learn, That we in truth can nothing know! That in my heart like fire doth burn. 'Tis true I've more cunning than all your dull tribe, Magister and doctor, priest, parson, and scribe; Scruple or doubt comes not to enthrall me, Neither can devil nor hell now appal me-- Hence also my heart must all pleasure forego! I may not pretend, aught rightly to know, I may not pretend, through teaching, to find A means to improve or convert mankind. Then I have neither goods nor treasure, No worldly honour, rank, or pleasure; No dog in such fashion would longer live! Therefore myself to magic I give, In hope, through spirit-voice and might, Secrets now veiled to bring to light, That I no more, with aching brow, Need speak of what I nothing know; That I the force may recognise That binds creation's inmost energies; Her vital powers, her embryo seeds survey, And fling the trade in empty words away. O full-orb'd moon, did but thy rays Their last upon mine anguish gaze! Beside this desk, at dead of night, Oft have I watched to hail thy light: Then, pensive friend! o'er book and scroll, With soothing power, thy radiance stole! In thy dear light, ah, might I climb, Freely, some mountain height sublime, Round mountain caves with spirits ride, In thy mild haze o'er meadows glide, And, purged from knowledge-fumes, renew My spirit, in thy healing dew! Woe's me! still prison'd in the gloom Of this abhorr'd and musty room! Where heaven's dear light itself doth pass, But dimly through the painted glass! Hemmed in by book-heaps, piled around, Worm-eaten, hid 'neath dust and mould, Which to the high vault's topmost bound, A smoke-stained paper doth enfold; With boxes round thee piled, and glass, And many a useless instrument, With old ancestral lumber blent-- This is thy world! a world! alas! And dost thou ask why heaves thy heart, With tighten'd pressure in thy breast? Why the dull ache will not depart, By which thy life-pulse is oppress'd? Instead of nature's living sphere, Created for mankind of old, Brute skeletons surround thee here, And dead men's bones in smoke and mould. Up! Forth into the distant land! Is not this book of mystery By Nostradamus' proper hand, An all-sufficient guide? Thou'lt see The courses of the stars unroll'd; When nature doth her thoughts unfold To thee, thy soul shall rise, and seek Communion high with her to hold, As spirit doth with spirit speak! Vain by dull poring to divine The meaning of each hallow'd sign. Spirits! I feel you hov'ring near; Make answer, if my voice ye hear! (He opens the book and perceives the sign of the Macrocosmos.) Ah! at this spectacle through every sense, What sudden ecstasy of joy is flowing! I feel new rapture, hallow'd and intense, Through every nerve and vein with ardour glowing. Was it a god who character'd this scroll, The tumult in my spirit healing, O'er my sad heart with rapture stealing, And by a mystic impulse, to my soul, The powers of nature all around revealing. Am I a God? What light intense! In these pure symbols do I see, Nature exert her vital energy. Now of the wise man's words I learn the sense; "Unlock'd the spirit-world is lying, Thy sense is shut, thy heart is dead! Up scholar, lave, with zeal undying, Thine earthly breast in the morning-red!" (He contemplates the sign.) How all things live and work, and ever blending, Weave one vast whole from Being's ample range! How powers celestial, rising and descending, Their golden buckets ceaseless interchange! Their flight on rapture-breathing pinions winging, From heaven to earth their genial influence bringing, Through the wild sphere their chimes melodious ringing! A wondrous show! but ah! a show alone! Where shall I grasp thee, infinite nature, where? Ye breasts, ye fountains of all life, whereon Hang heaven and earth, from which the withered heart For solace yearns, ye still impart Your sweet and fostering tides--where are ye--where? Ye gush, and must I languish in despair? (He turns over the leaves of the book impatiently, and perceives the sign of the Earth-spirit.) How all unlike the influence of this sign! Earth-spirit, thou to me art nigher, E'en now my strength is rising higher, E'en now I glow as with new wine; Courage I feel, abroad the world to dare, The woe of earth, the bliss of earth to bear, With storms to wrestle, brave the lightning's glare, And mid the crashing shipwreck not despair. Clouds gather over me-- The moon conceals her light-- The lamp is quench'd-- Vapours are rising-- Quiv'ring round my head Flash the red beams-- Down from the vaulted roof A shuddering horror floats, And seizes me! I feel it, spirit, prayer-compell'd, 'tis thou Art hovering near! Unveil thyself! Ha! How my heart is riven now! Each sense, with eager palpitation, Is strain'd to catch some new sensation! I feel my heart surrender'd unto thee! Thou must! Thou must! Though life should be the fee! (He seizes the book, and pronounces mysteriously the sign of the spirit. A ruddy flame flashes up; the spirit appears in the flame.) SPIRIT Who calls me? FAUST (turning aside) Dreadful shape! SPIRIT With might, thou hast compelled me to appear, Long hast been sucking at my sphere, And now-- FAUST Woe's me! I cannot bear the sight! SPIRIT To see me thou dost breathe thine invocation, My voice to hear, to gaze upon my brow; Me doth thy strong entreaty bow-- Lo! I am here I--What cowering agitation Grasps thee, the demigod! Where's now the soul's deep cry? Where is the breast, which in its depths a world conceiv'd And bore and cherished? which, with ecstasy, To rank itself with us, the spirits, heaved? Where art thou, Faust? whose voice I heard resound, Who towards me press'd with energy profound? Art thou he? Thou,--who by my breath art blighted, Who, in his spirit's depths affrighted, Trembles, a crush'd and writhing worm! FAUST Shall I yield, thing of flame, to thee? Faust, and thine equal, I am he! SPIRIT In the currents of life, in action's storm, I float and I wave With billowy motion! Birth and the grave A limitless ocean, A constant weaving With change still rife, A restless heaving, A glowing life-- Thus time's whirring loom unceasing I ply, And weave the life-garment of deity. FAUST Thou, restless spirit, dost from end to end O'ersweep the world; how near I feel to thee! SPIRIT Thou'rt like the spirit, thou dost comprehend, Not me!   (Vanishes.) FAUST (deeply moved) I, God's own image! And not rank with thee!  (A knock.) Oh death! I know it--'tis my famulus-- My fairest fortune now escapes! That all these visionary shapes A soulless groveller should banish thus! (WAGNER in his dressing gown and night-cap, a lamp in his hand. FAUST turns round reluctantly.) WAGNER Pardon! I heard you here declaim; A Grecian tragedy you doubtless read? Improvement in this art is now my aim, For now-a-days it much avails. Indeed An actor, oft I've heard it said, as teacher, May give instruction to a preacher. FAUST Ay, if your priest should be an actor too, As not improbably may come to pass. WAGNER When in his study pent the whole year through, Man views the world, as through an optic glass, On a chance holiday, and scarcely then, How by persuasion can he govern men? FAUST If feeling prompt not, if it doth not flow Fresh from the spirit's depths, with strong control Swaying to rapture every listener's soul, Idle your toil; the chase you may forego! Brood o'er your task! Together glue, Cook from another's feast your own ragout, Still prosecute your paltry game, And fan your ash-heaps into flame! 'Thus children's wonder you'll excite, And apes', if such your appetite; But that which issues from the heart alone, Will bend tile hearts of others to your own. WAGNER The speaker in delivery will find Success alone; I still am far behind. FAUST A worthy object still pursue! Be not a hollow tinkling fool! Sound understanding, judgment true, Find utterance without art or rule; And when in earnest you are moved to speak, Then is it needful cunning words to seek? Your fine harangues, so polish'd in their kind, Wherein the shreds of human thought ye twist, Are unrefreshing as the empty wind, Whistling through wither'd leaves and autumn mist! WAGNER Oh God! How long is art, Our life how short! With earnest zeal Still as I ply the critic's task, I feel A strange oppression both of head and heart. The very means how hardly are they won, By which we to the fountains rise! And haply, ere one half the course is run, Check'd in his progress, the poor devil dies. FAUST Parchment, is that the sacred fount whence roll Waters, he thirsteth not who once hath quaffed? Oh, if it gush not from thine inmost soul, Thou has not won the life-restoring draught. WAGNER Your pardon! 'tis delightful to transport Oneself into the spirit of the past, To see in times before us how a wise man thought, And what a glorious height we have achieved at last. FAUST Ay truly! even to the loftiest star! To us, my friend, the ages that are pass'd A book with seven seals, close-fasten'd, are; And what the spirit of the times men call, Is merely their own spirit after all, Wherein, distorted oft, the times are glass'd. Then truly, 'tis a sight to grieve the soul! At the first glance we fly it in dismay; A very lumber-room, a rubbish-hole; At best a sort of mock-heroic play, With saws pragmatical, and maxims sage, To suit the puppets and their mimic stage. WAGNER But then the world and man, his heart and brain! Touching these things all men would something know. FAUST Ay! what 'mong men as knowledge doth obtain! Who on the child its true name dares bestow? The few who somewhat of these things have known, Who their full hearts unguardedly reveal'd, Nor thoughts, nor feelings, from the mob conceal'd, Have died on crosses, or in flames been thrown.-- Excuse me, friend, far now the night is spent, For this time we must say adieu. WAGNER Still to watch on I had been well content, Thus to converse so learnedly with you. But as to-morrow will be Easter-day, Some further questions grant, I pray; With diligence to study still I fondly cling; Already I know much, but would know everything. (Exit.) FAUST (alone) How him alone all hope abandons never, To empty trash who clings, with zeal untired, With greed for treasure gropes, and, joy-inspir'd, Exults if earth-worms second his endeavour. And dare a voice of merely human birth, E'en here, where shapes immortal throng'd, intrude? Yet ah! thou poorest of the sons of earth, For once, I e'en to thee feel gratitude. Despair the power of sense did well-nigh blast, And thou didst save me ere I sank dismay'd, So giant-like the vision seem'd, so vast, I felt myself shrink dwarf'd as I survey'd! I, God's own image, from this toil of clay Already freed, with eager joy who hail'd The mirror of eternal truth unveil'd, Mid light effulgent and celestial day:-- I, more than cherub, whose unfetter'd soul With penetrative glance aspir'd to flow Through nature's veins, and, still creating, know The life of gods,--how am I punish'd now! One thunder-word hath hurl'd me from the goal! Spirit! I dare not lift me to thy sphere. What though my power compell'd thee to appear, My art was powerless to detain thee here. In that great moment, rapture-fraught, I felt myself so small, so great; Fiercely didst thrust me from the realm of thought Back on humanity's uncertain fate! Who'll teach me now? What ought Ito forego? Ought I that impulse to obey? Alas! our every deed, as well as every woe, Impedes the tenor of life's onward way! E'en to the noblest by the soul conceiv'd, Some feelings cling of baser quality; And when the goods of this world are achiev'd, Each nobler aim is termed a cheat, a lie. Our aspirations, our soul's genuine life, Grow torpid in the din of earthly strife. Though youthful phantasy, while hope inspires, Stretch o'er the infinite her wing sublime, A narrow compass limits her desires, When wreck'd our fortunes in the gulf of time. In the deep heart of man care builds her nest, O'er secret woes she broodeth there, Sleepless she rocks herself and scareth joy and rest; Still is she wont some new disguise to wear, She may as house and court, as wife and child appear, As dagger, poison, fire and flood; Imagined evils chill thy blood, And what thou ne'er shall lose, o'er that dost shed the tear. I am not like the gods! Feel it I must; I'm like the earth-worm, writhing in the dust, Which, as on dust it feeds, its native fare, Crushed 'neath the passer's tread, lies buried there. Is it not dust, wherewith this lofty wall, With hundred shelves, confines me round; Rubbish, in thousand shapes, may I not call What in this moth-world doth my being bound? Here, what doth fail me, shall I find? Read in a thousand tomes that, everywhere, Self-torture is the lot of human-kind, With but one mortal happy, here and there? Thou hollow skull, that grin, what should it say, But that thy brain, like mine, of old perplexed, Still yearning for the truth, hath sought the light of day. And in the twilight wandered, sorely vexed? Ye instruments, forsooth, ye mock at me,-- With wheel, and cog, and ring, and cylinder; To nature's portals ye should be the key; Cunning your wards, and yet the bolts ye fail to stir. Inscrutable in broadest light, To be unveil'd by force she doth refuse, What she reveals not to thy mental sight, Thou wilt not wrest me from her with levers and with screws. Old useless furnitures, yet stand ye here, Because my sire ye served, now dead and gone. Old scroll, the smoke of years dost wear, So long as o'er this desk the sorry lamp hath shone. Better my little means hath squandered quite away, Than burden'd by that little here to sweat and groan! Wouldst thou possess thy heritage, essay, By use to render it thine own! What we employ not, but impedes our way, That which the hour creates, that can it use alone! But wherefore to yon Spot is riveted my gaze? Is yonder flasket there a magnet to my sight? Whence this mild radiance that around me plays, As when, 'mid forest gloom, reigneth the moon's soft light? Hail precious phial! Thee, with reverent awe, Down from thine old receptacle I draw! Science in thee I hail and human art. Essence of deadliest powers, refin'd and sure, Of soothing anodynes abstraction pure, Now in thy master's need thy grace impart! I gaze on thee, my pain is lull'd to rest; I grasp thee, calm'd the tumult in my breast; The flood-tide of my spirit ebbs away; Onward I'm summon'd o'er a boundless main, Calm at my feet expands the glassy plain, To shores unknown allures a brighter day. Lo, where a car of fire, on airy pinion, Comes floating towards me I I'm prepar'd to fly By a new track through ether's wide dominion, To distant spheres of pure activity. This life intense, this godlike ecstasy-- Worm that thou art such rapture canst thou earn? Only resolve with courage stern and high, Thy visage from the radiant sun to turn! Dare with determin'd will to burst the portals Past which in terror others fain would steal Now is the time, through deeds, to show that mortals The calm sublimity of gods can feel; To shudder not at yonder dark abyss, Where phantasy creates her own self-torturing brood, Right onward to the yawning gulf to press, Around whose narrow jaws rolleth hell's fiery flood; With glad resolve to take the fatal leap, Though danger threaten thee, to sink in endless sleep! Pure crystal goblet! forth I draw thee now, From out thine antiquated case, where thou Forgotten hast reposed for many a year! Oft at my father's revels thou didst shine, To glad the earnest guests was thine, As each to other passed the generous cheer. The gorgeous brede of figures, quaintly wrought, Which he who quaff'd must first in rhyme expound, Then drain the goblet at one draught profound, Hath nights of boyhood to fond memory brought. I to my neighbour shall not reach thee now, Nor on thy rich device shall I my cunning show. Here is a juice, makes drunk without delay; Its dark brown flood thy crystal round doth fill; Let this last draught, the product of my skill, My own free choice, be quaff'd with resolute will, A solemn festive greeting, to the coming day! (He places the goblet to his mouth.) (Tue ringing of bells, and choral voices.) Chorus of ANGELS Christ is arisen! Mortal, all hail to thee, Thou whom mortality, Earth's sad reality, Held as in prison. FAUST What hum melodious, what clear silvery chime Thus draws the goblet from my lips away? Ye deep-ton'd bells, do ye with voice sublime, Announce the solemn dawn of Easter-day? Sweet choir! are ye the hymn of comfort singing, Which once around the darkness of the grave, From seraph-voices, in glad triumph ringing, Of a new covenant assurance gave? CHORUS OF WOMEN We, his true-hearted, With spices and myrrh, Embalmed the departed, And swathed him with care; Here we conveyed Him, Our Master, so dear; Alas! Where we laid Him, The Christ is not here. CHORUS OF ANGELS Christ is arisen! Blessed the loving one, Who from earth's trial throes, Healing and strengthening woes, Soars as from prison. FAUST Wherefore, ye tones celestial, sweet and strong, Come ye a dweller in the dust to seek? Ring out your chimes believing crowds among, The message well I hear, my faith alone is weak; From faith her darling, miracle, hath sprung. Aloft to yonder spheres I dare not soar, Whence sound the tidings of great joy; And yet, with this sweet strain familiar when a boy, Back it recalleth me to life once more. Then would celestial love, with holy kiss, Come o'er me in the Sabbath's stilly hour, While, fraught with solemn meaning and mysterious Chim'd the deep-sounding bell, and prayer was bliss; A yearning impulse, undefin'd yet dear, Drove me to wander on through wood and field; With heaving breast and many a burning tear, I felt with holy joy a world reveal'd. Gay sports and festive hours proclaim'd with joyous pealing, This Easter hymn in days of old; And fond remembrance now doth me, with childlike feeling, Back from the last, the solemn step, withhold. O still sound on, thou sweet celestial strain! The tear-drop flows,--Earth, I am thine again! CHORUS OF DISCIPLES He whom we mourned as dead, Living and glorious, From the dark grave bath fled, O'er death victorious; Almost creative bliss Waits on his growing powers; Ah! Him on earth we miss; Sorrow and grief are ours. Yearning he left his own, Mid sore annoy; Ah! we must needs bemoan. Master, thy joy! CHORUS OF ANGELS Christ is arisen, Redeem'd from decay. The bonds which imprison Your souls, rend away! Praising the Lord with zeal, By deeds that love reveal, Like brethren true and leal Sharing the daily meal, To all that sorrow feel Whisp'ring of heaven's weal, Still is the master near, Still is he here! BEFORE THE GATE Promenaders of all sorts pass out. ARTISANS Why choose ye that direction, pray? OTHERS To the hunting-lodge we're on our way. THE FIRST We towards the mill are strolling on. A MECHANIC A walk to Wasserhof were best. A SECOND The road is not a pleasant one. THE OTHERS What will you do? A THIRD I'll join the rest. A FOURTH Let's up to Burghof, there you'll find good cheer, The prettiest maidens and the best of beer, And brawls of a prime sort. A FIFTH You scapegrace! How; Your skin still itching for a row? Thither I will not go, I loathe the place. SERVANT GIRL No, no! I to the town my steps retrace. ANOTHER Near yonder poplars he is sure to be. THE FIRST And if he is, what matters it to me! With you he'll walk, he'll dance with none but you, And with your pleasures what have I to do? THE SECOND To-day he will not be alone, he said His friend would be with him, the curly-head. STUDENT Why how those buxom girls step on! Come, brother, we will follow them anon. Strong beer, a damsel smartly dress'd, Stinging tobacco,--these I love the best. BURGHER'S DAUGHTER Look at those handsome fellows there! 'Tis really shameful, I declare, The very best society they shun, After those servant girls forsooth, to run. SECOND STUDENT (to the first) Not quite so fast! for in our rear, Two girls, well-dress'd, are drawing near; Not far from us the one doth dwell, And sooth to say, II like her well. They walk demurely, yet you'll see, That they will let us join them presently. THE FIRST Not I! restraints of all kinds I detest. Quick! let us catch the wild-game ere it flies, The hand on Saturday the mop that plies, Will on the Sunday fondle you the best. BURGHER No, this new Burgomaster, I like him not, God knows, Now, he's in office, daily more arrogant he grows; And for the town, what doth he do for it? Are not things worse from day to day? To more restraints we must submit; And taxes more than ever pay. BEGGAR (sings) Kind gentleman and ladies fair, So rosy-cheek'd and trimly dress'd, Be pleas'd to listen to my prayer, Relieve and pity the distress'd. Let me not vainly sing my lay! His heart's most glad whose hand is free. Now when all men keep holiday, Should be a harvest-day to me. ANOTHER BURGHER On holidays and Sundays naught know I more inviting Than chatting about war and war's alarms, When folk in Turkey, up in arms, Far off, are 'gainst each other fighting. We at the window stand, our glasses drain, And watch adown the stream the painted vessels gliding, Then joyful we at eve come home again, And peaceful times we bless, peace long-abiding. THIRD BURGHER Ay, neighbour! So let matters stand for me! There they may scatter one another's brains, And wild confusion round them see-- So here at home in quiet all remains! OLD WOMAN (to the BURGHERS' DAUGHTERS) Heyday! How smart! The fresh young blood! Who would not fall in love with you? Not quite so proud! 'Tis well and good! And what you wish, that I could help you to. BURGHER'S DAUGHTER Come, Agatha! I care not to be seen Walking in public with these witches. True, My future lover, last St. Andrew's E'en, In flesh and blood she brought before my view. ANOTHER And mine she show'd me also in the glass, A soldier's figure, with companions bold; I look around, I seek him as I pass, In vain, his form I nowhere can behold. SOLDIERS Fortress with turrets And walls high in air, Damsel disdainful, Haughty and fair, These be my prey! Bold is the venture, Costly the pay! Hark how the trumpet Thither doth call us, Where either pleasure Or death may befall us. Hail to the tumult! Life's in the field! Damsel and fortress To us must yield. Bold is the venture, Costly the pay! Gaily the soldier Marches away. FAUST and WAGNER FAUST Loosed from their fetters are streams and rills Through the gracious spring-tide's all-quickening glow; Hope's budding joy in the vale doth blow; Old Winter back to the savage hills Withdraweth his force, decrepid now. Thence only impotent icy grains Scatters he as he wings his flight, Striping with sleet the verdant plains; But the sun endureth no trace of white; Everywhere growth and movement are rife, All things investing with hues of life: Though flowers are lacking, varied of dye, Their colours the motly throng supply. Turn thee around, and from this height, Back to the town direct thy sight. Forth from the hollow, gloomy gate, Stream forth the masses, in bright array. Gladly seek they the sun to-day; The Lord's Resurrection they celebrate: For they themselves have risen, with joy, From tenement sordid, from cheerless room, From bonds of toil, from care and annoy, From gable and roof's o'er-hanging gloom, From crowded alley and narrow street, And from the churches' awe-breathing night, All now have come forth into the light. Look, only look, on nimble feet, Through garden and field how spread the throng, How o'er the river's ample sheet, Many a gay wherry glides along; And see, deep sinking in the tide, Pushes the last boat now away. E'en from yon far hill's path-worn side, Flash the bright hues of garments gay. Hark! Sounds of village mirth arise; This is the people's paradise. Both great and small send up a cheer; Here am I man, I feel it here. WAGNER Sir Doctor, in a walk with you There's honour and instruction too; Yet here alone I care not to resort, Because I coarseness hate of every sort. This fiddling, shouting, skittling, I detest; I hate the tumult of the vulgar throng; They roar as by the evil one possess'd, And call it pleasure, call it song. PEASANTS (under the linden-tree) Dance and song The shepherd for the dance was dress'd, With ribbon, wreath, and coloured vest, A gallant show displaying. And round about the linden-trees, They footed it right merrily. Juchhe! Juchhe! Juchheisa! Heisa! He! So fiddle-bow was braying. Our swain amidst the circle press'd, He push'd a maiden trimly dress'd, And jogg'd her with his elbow; The buxom damsel turn'd her head, "Now that's a stupid trick!" she said, Juchhe! Juchhe! Juchhesia! Heisa! He! Don't be so rude, good fellow! Swift in the circle they advanced, They danced to right, to left they danced, And all the skirts were swinging. And they grew red, and they grew warm, Panting, they rested arm in arm, Juchhe! Juchhe! Juchheisa! Heisa! He! To hip their elbow bringing. Don't make so free! How many a maid Has been betroth'd and then betray'd; And has repented after! Yet still he flatter'd her aside, And from the linden, far and wide, Juchhe! Juchhe! Juchheisa! Heisa! He! Rang fiddle-bow and laughter. OLD PEASANT Doctor, 'tis really kind of you, To condescend to come this way, A highly learned man like you, To join our mirthful throng to-day. Our fairest cup I offer you, Which we with sparkling drink have crown'd, And pledging you, I pray aloud, That every drop within its round, While it your present thirst allays, May swell the number of your days. FAUST I take the cup you kindly reach, Thanks and prosperity to each! (The crowd gather round in a circle.) OLD PEASANT Ay, truly! 'tis well done, that you Our festive meeting thus attend; You, who in evil days of yore, So often show'd yourself our friend! Full many a one stands living here, Who from the fever's deadly blast, Your father rescu'd, when his skill The fatal sickness stay'd at last. A young man then, each house you sought, Where reign'd the mortal pestilence. Corpse after corpse was carried forth, But still unscath'd you issued thence. Sore then your trials and severe; The Helper yonder aids the helper here. ALL Heaven bless the trusty friend, and long To help the poor his life prolong! FAUST To Him above in homage bend, Who prompts the helper and Who help doth send. (He proceeds with WAGNER.) WAGNER What feelings, great man, must thy breast inspire, At homage paid thee by this crowd! Thrice blest Who from the gifts by him possessed Such benefit can draw! The sire Thee to his boy with reverence shows; They press around, inquire, advance, Hush'd is the fiddle, check'd the dance. Where thou dost pass they stand in rows, And each aloft his bonnet throws, But little fails and they to thee, As though the Host came by, would bend the knee. FAUST A few steps further, up to yonder stone! Here rest we from our walk. In times long past, Absorb'd in thought, here oft I sat alone, And disciplin'd myself with prayer and fast. Then rich in hope, with faith sincere, With sighs, and hands in anguish press'd, The end of that sore plague, with many a tear, From heaven's dread Lord, I sought to wrest. The crowd's applause assumes a scornful tone. Oh, could'st thou in my inner being read, How little either sire or son, Of such renown deserves the meed! My sire, of good repute, and sombre mood, O'er nature's powers and every mystic zone, With honest zeal, but methods of his own, With toil fantastic loved to brood; His time in dark alchemic cell, With brother adepts he would spend, And there antagonists compel, Through numberless receipts to blend. A ruddy lion there, a suitor bold, In tepid bath was with the lily wed. Thence both, while open flames around them roll'd, Were tortur'd to another bridal bed. Was then the youthful queen descried With varied colours in the flask This was our medicine; the patients died, "Who were restored?" none cared to ask. With our infernal mixture thus, ere long, These hills and peaceful vales among, We rag'd more fiercely than the pest; Myself the deadly poison did to thousands give; They pined away, I yet must live, To hear the reckless murderers blest. WAGNER Why let this thought your soul o'ercast? Can man do more than with nice skill, With firm and conscientious will, Practise the art transmitted from the past? If thou thy sire dost honour in thy youth, His lore thou gladly wilt receive; In manhood, dost thou spread the bounds of truth, Then may thy son a higher goal achieve. FAUST How blest, in whom the fond desire From error's sea to rise, hope still renews! What a man knows not, that he doth require, And what he knoweth, that he cannot use. But let not moody thoughts their shadow throw O'er the calm beauty of this hour serene! In the rich sunset see how brightly glow Yon cottage homes, girt round with verdant green! Slow sinks the orb, the day is now no more; Yonder he hastens to diffuse new life. Oh for a pinion from the earth to soar, And after, ever after him to strive! Then should I see the world below, Bathed in the deathless evening-beams, The vales reposing, every height a-glow, The silver brooklets meeting golden streams. The savage mountain, with its cavern'd side, Bars not my godlike progress. Lo, the ocean, Its warm bays heaving with a tranquil motion, To my rapt vision opes its ample tide! But now at length the god appears to sink; A new-born impulse wings my flight, Onward I press, his quenchless light to drink, The day before me, and behind the night, The pathless waves beneath, and over me the skies. Fair dream, it vanish'd with the parting day! Alas! that when on spirit-wing we rise, No wing material lifts our mortal clay. But 'tis our inborn impulse, deep and strong, Upwards and onwards still to urge our flight, When far above us pours its thrilling song The sky-lark, lost in azure light, When on extended wing amain O'er pine-crown'd height the eagle soars, And over moor and lake, the crane Still striveth towards its native shores. WAGNER To strange conceits oft I myself must own, But impulse such as this I ne'er have known: Nor woods, nor fields, can long our thoughts engage, Their wings I envy not the feather'd kind; Far otherwise the pleasures of the mind, Bear us from book to book, from page to page! Then winter nights grow cheerful; keen delight Warms every limb; and ah! when we unroll Some old and precious parchment, at the sight All heaven itself descends upon the soul. FAUST Thy heart by one sole impulse is possess'd; Unconscious of the other still remain! Two souls, alas! are lodg'd within my breast, Which struggle there for undivided reign: One to the world, with obstinate desire, And closely-cleaving organs, still adheres; Above the mist, the other doth aspire, With sacred vehemence, to purer spheres. Oh, are there spirits in the air, Who float 'twixt heaven and earth dominion wielding, Stoop hither from your golden atmosphere, Lead me to scenes, new life and fuller yielding! A magic mantle did I but possess, Abroad to waft me as on viewless wings, I'd prize it far beyond the costliest dress, Nor would I change it for the robe of kings. WAGNER Call not the spirits who on mischief wait! Their troop familiar, streaming through the air, From every quarter threaten man's estate, And danger in a thousand forms prepare! They drive impetuous from the frozen north, With fangs sharp-piercing, and keen arrowy tongue From the ungenial east they issue forth, And prey, with parching breath, upon thy lungs; If, waft'd on the desert's flaming wing, They from the south heap fire upon the brain, Refreshment from the west at first they bring, Anon to drown thyself and field and plain. In wait for mischief, they are prompt to hear; With guileful purpose our behests obey; Like ministers of grace they oft appear, And lisp like angels, to betray. But let us hence! Grey eve doth all things blend, The air grows chill, the mists descend! 'Tis in the evening first our home we prize-- Why stand you thus, and gaze with wondering eyes? What in the gloom thus moves you? FAUST Yon black hound See'st thou, through corn and stubble scampering round? WAGNER I've mark'd him long, naught strange in him I see! FAUST Note him! What takest thou the brute to be? WAGNER But for a poodle, whom his instinct serves His master's track to find once more. FAUST Dost mark how round us, with wide spiral curves, He wheels, each circle closer than before? And, if I err not, he appears to me A line of fire upon his track to leave. WAGNER Naught but a poodle black of hue I see; 'Tis some illusion doth your sight deceive. FAUST Methinks a magic coil our feet around, He for a future snare doth lightly spread. WAGNER FAUST The circle narrows, he's already near! WAGNER A dog dost see, no spectre have we here; He growls, doubts, lays him on his belly, too, And wags his tail--as dogs are wont to do. FAUST Come hither, Sirrah! join our company! WAGNER A very poodle, he appears to be! Thou standest still, for thee he'll wait; Thou speak'st to him, he fawns upon thee straight; Aught thou mayst lose, again he'll bring, And for thy stick will into water spring. FAUST Thou'rt right indeed; no traces now I see Whatever of a spirit's agency. 'Tis training.--nothing more. WAGNER A dog well taught E'en by the wisest of us may be sought. Ay, to your favour he's entitled too, Apt scholar of the students, 'tis his due! (They enter the gate of the town.) STUDY FAUST (entering with the poodle) Now field and meadow I've forsaken; O'er them deep night her veil doth draw; In us the better soul doth waken, With feelings of foreboding awe, All lawless promptings, deeds unholy, Now slumber, and all wild desires; The love of man doth sway us wholly, And love to God the soul inspires. Peace, poodle, peace! Scamper not thus; obey me! Why at the threshold snuffest thou so? Behind the stove now quietly lay thee, My softest cushion to thee I'll throw. As thou, without, didst please and amuse me Running and frisking about on the hill, So tendance now I will not refuse thee; A welcome guest, if thou'lt be still. Ah! when the friendly taper gloweth, Once more within our narrow cell, Then in the heart itself that knoweth, A light the darkness doth dispel. Reason her voice resumes; returneth Hope's gracious bloom, with promise rife; For streams of life the spirit yearneth, Ah! for the very fount of life. Poodle, snarl not! with the tone that arises. Hallow'd and peaceful, my soul within, Accords not thy growl, thy bestial din. We find it not strange, that man despises What he conceives not; That he the good and fair misprizes-- Finding them often beyond his ken; Will the dog snarl at them like men? But ah! Despite my will, it stands confessed, Contentment welleth up no longer in my breast. Yet wherefore must the stream, alas, so soon be dry, That we once more athirst should lie? Full oft this sad experience hath been mine; Nathless the want admits of compensation; For things above the earth we learn to pine, Our spirits yearn for revelation, Which nowhere burns with purer beauty blent, Than here in the New Testament. To ope the ancient text an impulse strong Impels me, and its sacred lore, With honest purpose to explore, And render into my loved German tongue. (He opens a volume, and applies himself to it.) 'Tis writ, "In the beginning was the Word!" I pause, perplex'd! Who now will help afford? I cannot the mere Word so highly prize; I must translate it otherwise, If by the spirit guided as I read. "In the beginning was the Sense!" Take heed, The import of this primal sentence weigh, Lest thy too hasty pen be led astray! Is force creative then of Sense the dower? "In the beginning was the Power!" Thus should it stand: yet, while the line I trace. A something warns me, once more to efface. The spirit aids! from anxious scruples freed, I write, "In the beginning was the Deed!" Am I with thee my room to share, Poodle, thy barking now forbear, Forbear thy howling! Comrade so noisy, ever growling, I cannot suffer here to dwell. One or the other, mark me well, Forthwith must leave the cell. I'm loath the guest-right to withhold; The door's ajar, the passage clear; But what must now mine eyes behold! Are nature's laws suspended here? Real is it, or a phantom show? In length and breadth how doth my poodle grow! He lifts himself with threat'ning mien, In likeness of a dog no longer seen! What spectre have I harbour'd thus! Huge as a hippopotamus, With fiery eye, terrific tooth! Ah I now I know thee, sure enough! For such a base, half-hellish brood, The key of Solomon is good. SPIRITS (without) Captur'd there within is one! Stay without and follow none! Like a fox in iron snare, Hell's old lynx is quaking there, But take heed! Hover round, above, below, To and fro, Then from durance is he freed! Can ye aid him, spirits all, Leave him not in mortal thrall! Many a time and oft bath he Served us, when at liberty. FAUST The monster to confront, at first, The spell of Four must be rehears'd; Salamander shall kindle, Writhe nymph of the wave, In air sylph shall dwindle, And Kobold shall slave. Who doth ignore The primal Four, Nor knows aright Their use and might, O'er spirits will he Ne'er master be! Vanish in the fiery glow, Salamander! Rushingly together flow. Undine! Shimmer in the meteor's gleam, Sylphide! Hither bring thine homely aid, Incubus! Incubus! Step forth! I do adjure thee thus! None of the Four Lurks in the beast: He grins at me, untroubled as before; I have not hurt him in the least. A spell of fear Thou now shalt hear. Art thou, comrade fell, Fugitive from hell? See then this sign, Before which incline The murky troops of Hell! With bristling hair now doth the creature swell. Canst thou, reprobate, Read the uncreate, Unspeakable, diffused Throughout the heavenly sphere, Shamefully abused, Transpierced with nail and spear! Behind the stove, tam'd by my spells, Like an elephant he swells; Wholly now he fills the room, He into mist will melt away. Ascend not to the ceiling! Come, Thyself at the master's feet now lay! Thou seest that mine is no idle threat. With holy fire I will scorch thee yet! Wait not the might That lies in the triple-glowing light! Wait not the might Of all my arts in fullest measure! MEPHISTOPHELES (As the mist sinks, comes forward from behind the stove, in the dress of a travelling scholar) Why all this uproar? What's the master's pleasure? FAUST This then the kernel of the brute! A travelling scholar? Why I needs must smile. MEPHISTOPHELES Your learned reverence humbly I salute! You've made me swelter in a pretty style. FAUST Thy name? MEPHISTOPHELES The question trifling seems from one, Who it appears the Word doth rate so low; Who, undeluded by mere outward show, To Being's depths would penetrate alone. FAUST With gentlemen like you indeed The inward essence from the name we read, As all too plainly it doth appear, When Beelzebub, Destroyer, Liar, meets the ear. Who then art thou? MEPHISTOPHELES Part of that power which still Produceth good, whilst ever scheming ill. FAUST What hidden mystery in this riddle lies? MEPHISTOPHELES The spirit I, which evermore denies! And justly; for whate'er to light is brought Deserves again to be reduced to naught; Then better 'twere that naught should be. Thus all the elements which ye Destruction, Sin, or briefly, Evil, name, As my peculiar element I claim. FAUST Thou nam'st thyself a part, and yet a whole I see. MEPHISTOPHELES The modest truth I speak to thee. Though folly's microcosm, man, it seems, Himself to be a perfect whole esteems: Part of the part am I, which at the first was all, A part of darkness, which gave birth to light, Proud light, who now his mother would enthrall, Contesting space and ancient rank with night. Yet he succeedeth not, for struggle as he will, To forms material he adhereth still; From them he streameth, them he maketh fair, And still the progress of his beams they check; And so, I trust, when comes the final wreck, Light will, ere long, the doom of matter share. FAUST Thy worthy avocation now I guess! Wholesale annihilation won't prevail, So thou'rt beginning on a smaller scale. MEPHISTOPHELES And, to say truth, as yet with small success. Oppos'd to naught, this clumsy world, The something--it subsisteth still; Not yet is it to ruin hurl'd, Despite the efforts of my will. Tempests and earthquakes, fire and flood, I've tried; Yet land and ocean still unchang'd abide! And then of humankind and beasts, brood,-- Neither o'er them can I extend my sway. What countless myriads have I swept away! Yet ever circulates the fresh young blood. the accursed It is enough to drive me to despair! As in the earth, in water, and in air, A thousand germs burst forth spontaneously; In moisture, drought, heat, cold, they still appear! Had I not flame selected as my sphere Nothing apart had been reserved for me. FAUST So thou with thy cold devil's fist Still clench'd in malice impotent Dost the creative power resist, The active, the beneficent! Henceforth some other task essay, Of Chaos thou the wondrous son! MEPHISTOPHELES We will consider what you say, And talk about it more anon! For this time have I leave to go? FAUST Why thou shouldst ask, I cannot see. Since thee I now have learned to know, At thy good pleasure, visit me. Here is the window, here the door, The chimney, too, may serve thy need. MEPHISTOPHELES I must confess, my stepping o'er Thy threshold a slight hindrance doth impede; The wizard-foot doth me retain. FAUST The pentagram thy peace doth mar? To me, thou son of hell, explain, How earnest thou in, if this thine exit bar? Could such a spirit aught ensnare? MEPHISTOPHELES Observe it well, it is not drawn with care, One of the angles, that which points without, Is, as thou seest, not quite closed. FAUST Chance hath the matter happily dispos'd! So thou my captive art? No doubt! By accident thou thus art caught! MEPHISTOPHELES In sprang the dog, indeed, observing naught; Things now assume another shape, The devil's in the house and can't escape. FAUST Why through the window not withdraw? MEPHISTOPHELES For ghosts and f or the devil 'tis a law. Where they stole in, there they must forth. We're free The first to choose; as to the second, slaves are we. FAUST E'en hell hath its peculiar laws, I see! I'm glad of that! a pact may then be made, The which you gentlemen will surely keep? MEPHISTOPHELES What e'er therein is promised thou shalt reap, No tittle shall remain unpaid. But such arrangements time require; We'll speak of them when next we meet; Most earnestly I now entreat, This once permission to retire. FAUST Another moment prithee here remain, Me with some happy word to pleasure. MEPHISTOPHELES Now let me go! ere long I'll come again, Then thou may'st question at thy leisure. FAUST 'Twas not toy purpose thee to lime; The snare hast entered of thine own free will: Let him who holds the devil, hold him still! So soon he'll catch him not a second time. MEPHISTOPHELES If it so please thee, I'm at thy command; Only on this condition, understand; That worthily thy leisure to beguile, I here may exercise my arts awhile. FAUST Thou'rt free to do so! Gladly I'll attend; But be thine art a pleasant one! MEPHISTOPHELES My friend, This hour enjoyment more intense, Shall captivate each ravish'd sense, Than thou could'st compass in the bound Of the whole year's unvarying round; And what the dainty spirits sing, The lovely images they bring, Are no fantastic sorcery. Rich odours shall regale your smell, On choicest sweets your palate dwell, Your feelings thrill with ecstasy. No preparation do we need, Here we together are. Proceed. SPIRITS Hence overshadowing gloom, Vanish from sight! O'er us thine azure dome, Bend, beauteous light! Dark clouds that o'er us spread, Melt in thin air! Stars, your soft radiance shed, Tender and fair. Girt with celestial might, Winging their airy flight, Spirits are thronging. Follows their forms of light Infinite longing! Flutter their vestures bright O'er field and grove! Where in their leafy bower Lovers the livelong hour Vow deathless love. Soft bloometh bud and bower! Bloometh the grove! Grapes from the spreading vine Crown the full measure; Fountains of foaming wine Gush from the pressure. Still where the currents wind, Gems brightly gleam. Leaving the hills behind On rolls the stream; Now into ample seas, Spreadeth the flood; Laying the sunny leas, Mantled with wood. Rapture the feather'd throng, Gaily careering, Sip as they float along; Sunward they're steering; On towards the isles of light Winging their way, That on the waters bright Dancingly play. Hark to the choral strain, Joyfully ringing! While on the grassy plain Dancers are springing; Climbing the steep hill's side, Skimming the glassy tide, Wander they there; Others on pinions wide Wing the blue air; All lifeward tending, upward still wending, Towards yonder stars that gleam, Far, far above; Stars from whose tender beam Rains blissful love. MEPHISTOPHELES Well done, my dainty spirits! now he slumbers! Ye have entranc'd him fairly with your numbers! This minstrelsy of yours I must repay,-- Thou art not yet the man to hold the devil fast!-- With fairest shapes your spells around him cast, And plunge him in a sea of dreams! But that this charm be rent, the threshold passed, Tooth of rat the way must clear. I need not conjure long it seems, One rustles hitherward, and soon my voice will hear. The master of the rats and mice, Of flies and frogs, of bugs and lice, Commands thy presence; without fear Come forth and gnaw the threshold here, Where he with oil has smear'd it.--Thou Com'st hopping forth already! Now To work! The point that holds me bound Is in the outer angle found. Another bite--so--now 'tis done-- Now, Faustus, till we meet again, dream on. FAUST (awaking) Am I once more deluded! must I deem That thus the throng of spirits disappear? The devil's presence, was it but a dream? Hath but a poodle scap'd and left me here? STUDY FAUST. MEPHISTOPHELES FAUST A knock? Come in! Who now would break my rest? MEPHISTOPHELES 'Tis I! FAUST Come in! MEPHISTOPHELES Thrice be the words express'd. FAUST Then I repeat, Come in! MEPHISTOPHELES 'Tis well, I hope that we shall soon agree! For now your fancies to expel, Here, as a youth of high degree, I come in gold-lac'd scarlet vest, And stiff-silk mantle richly dress'd, A cock's gay feather for a plume, A long and pointed rapier, too; And briefly I would counsel you To don at once the same costume, And, free from trammels, speed away, That what life is you may essay. FAUST In every garb I needs must feel oppress'd, My heart to earth's low cares a prey. Too old the trifler's part to play, Too young to live by no desire possess'd. What can the world to me afford? Renounce! renounce! is still the word; This is the everlasting song In every ear that ceaseless rings, And which, alas, our whole life long, Hoarsely each passing moment sings. But to new horror I awake each morn, And I could weep hot tears, to see the sun Dawn on another day, whose round forlorn Accomplishes no wish of mine--not one. Which still, with froward captiousness, impains E'en the presentiment of every joy, While low realities and paltry cares The spirit's fond imaginings destroy. Then must I too, when falls the veil of night, Stretch'd on my pallet languish in despair, Appalling dreams my soul affright; No rest vouchsafed me even there. The god, who throned within my breast resides, Deep in my soul can stir the springs; With sovereign sway my energies he guides, He cannot move external things; And so existence is to me a weight. Death fondly I desire, and life I hate. MEPHISTOPHELES And yet, methinks, by most 'twill be confess'd That Death is never quite a welcome guest. FAUST Happy the man around whose brow he binds The bloodstain'd wreath in conquest's dazzling hour; Or whom, excited by the dance, he finds Dissolv'd in bliss, in love's delicious bower! O that before the lofty spirit's might, Enraptured, I had rendered up my soul! MEPHISTOPHELES Yet did a certain man refrain one night, Of its brown juice to drain the crystal bowl. FAUST To play the spy diverts you then? MEPHISTOPHELES I own, Though not omniscient, much to me is known. FAUST If o'er my soul the tone familiar, stealing, Drew me from harrowing thought's bewild'ring maze, Touching the ling'ring chords of childlike feeling, With sweet harmonies of happier days: So curse I all, around the soul that windeth Its magic and alluring spell, And with delusive flattery bindeth Its victim to this dreary cell! Curs'd before all things be the high opinion, Wherewith the spirit girds itself around! Of shows delusive curs'd be the dominion, Within whose mocking sphere our sense is bound! Accurs'd of dreams the treacherous wiles, The cheat of glory, deathless fame! Accurs'd what each as property beguiles, Wife, child, slave, plough, whate'er its name! Accurs'd be mammon, when with treasure He doth to daring deeds incite: Or when to steep the soul in pleasure, He spreads the couch of soft delight! Curs'd be the grape's balsamic juice! Accurs'd love's dream, of joys the first! Accurs'd be hope! accurs'd be faith! And more than all, be patience curs'd! CHORUS OP SPIRITS (invisible) Woe! woe! Thou hast destroy'd The beautiful world With violent blow; 'Tis shiver'd! 'tis shatter'd! The fragments abroad by a demigod scatter'd! Now we sweep The wrecks into nothingness! Fondly we weep The beauty that's gone! Thou, 'mongst the Sons of earth, Lofty and mighty one, Build it once more! In thine own bosom the lost world restore! Now with unclouded sense Enter a new career; Songs shall salute thine ear, Ne'er heard before! MEPHISTOPHELES My little ones these spirits be. Hark! with shrewd intelligence, How they recommend to thee Action, and the joys of sense! In the busy world to dwell, Fain they would allure thee hence: For within this lonely cell, Stagnate sap of life and sense. Forbear to trifle longer with thy grief, Which, vulture-like, consumes thee in this den. The worst society is some relief, Making thee feel thyself a man with men. Nathless, it is not meant, I trow, To thrust thee 'mid the vulgar throng. I to the upper ranks do not belong; Yet if, by me companion'd, thou Thy steps through life forthwith wilt take; Upon the spot myself I'll make Thy comrade;-- Should it suit thy need, I am thy servant, am thy slave indeed! FAUST And how must I thy services repay? MEPHISTOPHELES Thereto thou lengthen'd respite hast! FAUST No! No! The devil is an egoist I know: And, for Heaven's sake, 'tis not his way Kindness to any one to show. Let the condition plainly be exprest! Such a domestic is a dangerous guest. MEPHISTOPHELES I'll pledge myself to be thy servant here, Still at thy back alert and prompt to be; But when together yonder we appear, Then shalt thou do the same for me. FAUST But small concern I feel for yonder world; Hast thou this system into ruin hurl'd, Another may arise the void to fill. This earth the fountain whence my pleasures flow, This sun doth daily shine upon my woe, And if this world I must forego, Let happen then,--what can and will. I to this theme will close mine ears, If men hereafter hate and love, FAUST And if there be in yonder spheres A depth below or height above. MEPHISTOPHELES In this mood thou mayst venture it. But make The compact! I at once will undertake To charm thee with mine arts. I'll give thee more Than mortal eye hath e'er beheld before. FAUST What, sorry Devil, hast thou to bestow? Was ever mortal spirit, in its high endeavour, Fathom'd by Being such as thou? Yet food thou hast which satisfieth never, Hast ruddy gold, that still doth flow Like restless quicksilver away, A game thou hast, at which none win who play, A girl who would, with amorous eyen, E'en from my breast, a neighbour snare, Lofty ambition's joy divine, That, meteor-like, dissolves in air. Show me the fruit that, ere 'tis pluck'd, doth rot, And trees, whose verdure daily buds anew! MEPHISTOPHELES Such a commission scares me not, I can provide such treasures, it is true; But, my good friend, a season will come round, When on what's good we may regale in peace. FAUST If e'er upon my couch, stretched at my ease, I'm found, Then may my life that instant cease! Me canst thou cheat with glozing wile Till self-reproach away I cast,-- Me with joy's lure canst thou beguile Let that day be for me the last! Be this our wager! MEPHISTOPHELES Settled! FAUST Sure and fast! When to the moment I shall say, "Linger awhile! so fair thou art!" Then mayst thou fetter me straightway, Then to the abyss will I depart! Then may the solemn death-bell sound, Then from thy service thou art free, The index then may cease its round, And time be never more for me! MEPHISTOPHELES I shall remember: pause, ere 'tis too late. FAUST Thereto a perfect right hast thou. My strength I do not rashly overrate. Slave am I here, at any rate, If thine, or whose, it matters not, I trow. MEPHISTOPHELES At thine inaugural feast I will this day Attend, my duties to commence.-- But one thing!--Accidents may happen, hence A line or two in writing grant, I pray. FAUST A writing, Pedant! dost demand from me? Man, and man's plighted word, are these unknown to thee? Is't not enough, that by the word I gave, My doom for evermore is cast? Doth not the world in all its currents rave, And must a promise hold me fast? Yet fixed is this delusion in our heart; Who, of his own free will, therefrom would part? How blest within whose breast truth reigneth pure! No sacrifice will he repent when made! A formal deed, with seal and signature, A spectre this from which all shrink afraid. The word its life resigneth in the pen, Leather and wax usurp the mastery then. Spirits of evil! what dost thou require? Brass, marble, parchment, paper, dost desire? Shall I with chisel, pen, or graver write? Thy choice is free; to me 'tis all the same. MEPHISTOPHELES Wherefore thy passion so excite And thus thine eloquence inflame? A scrap is for our compact good. Thou under-signest merely with a drop of blood. FAUST If this will satisfy thy mind, Thy whim I'll gratify, howe'er absurd. MEPHISTOPHELES Blood is a juice of very special kind. FAUST Be not afraid that I shall break my word! The scope of all my energy Is in exact accordance with my vow. Vainly I have aspired too high; I'm on a level but with such as thou; Me the great spirit scorn'd, defied; Nature from me herself doth hide; Rent is the web of thought; my mind Doth knowledge loathe of every kind. In depths of sensual pleasure drown'd, Let us our fiery passions still! Enwrapp'd in magic's veil profound, Let wondrous charms our senses thrill! Plunge we in time's tempestuous flow, Stem we the rolling surge of chance! There may alternate weal and woe, Success and failure, as they can, Mingle and shift in changeful dance! Excitement is the sphere for man. MEPHISTOPHELES Nor goal, nor measure is prescrib'd to you, If you desire to taste of every thing, To snatch at joy while on the wing, May your career amuse and profit too! Only fall to and don't be over coy! FAUST Hearken! The end I aim at is not joy; I crave excitement, agonizing bliss, Enamour'd hatred, quickening vexation. Purg'd from the love of knowledge, my vocation, The scope of all my powers henceforth be this, To bare my breast to every pang,--to know In my heart's core all human weal and woe, To grasp in thought the lofty and the deep, Men's various fortunes on my breast to heap, And thus to theirs dilate my individual mind, And share at length with them the shipwreck of mankind. MEPHISTOPHELES Oh, credit me, who still as ages roll, Have chew'd this bitter fare from year to year, No mortal, from the cradle to the bier, Digests the ancient leaven! Know, this Whole Doth for the Deity alone subsist! He in eternal brightness doth exist, Us unto darkness he hath brought, and here Where day and night alternate, is your sphere. FAUST But 'tis my will MEPHISTOPHELES Well spoken, I admit! But one thing puzzles me, my friend; Time's short, art long; methinks 'twere fit That you to friendly counsel should attend. A poet choose as your ally! Let him thought's wide dominion sweep, Each good and noble quality, Upon your honoured brow to heap; The lion's magnanimity, The fleetness of the hind, The fiery blood of Italy, The Northern's stedfast mind. Let him to you the mystery show To blend high aims and cunning low; And while youth's passions are aflame To fall in love by rule and plan! I fain would meet with such a man; Would him Sir Microcosmus name. FAUST What then am I, if I aspire in vain The crown of our humanity to gain, Towards which my every sense doth strain? MEPHISTOPHELES Thou'rt after all--just what thou art. Put on thy head a wig with countless locks, And to a cubit's height upraise thy socks, Still thou remainest ever, what thou art. FAUST I feel it, I have heap'd upon my brain The gather'd treasure of man's thought in vain; And when at length from studious toil I rest, No power, new-born, springs up within my breast; A hair's breadth is not added to my height, I am no nearer to the infinite. MEPHISTOPHELES Good sir, these things you view indeed, Just as by other men they're view'd; We must more cleverly proceed, Before life's joys our grasp elude. The devil! thou hast hands and feet, And head and heart are also thine; What I enjoy with relish sweet, Is it on that account less mine? If for six stallions I can pay, Do I not own their strength and speed? A proper man I dash away, As their two dozen legs were mine indeed. Up then, from idle pondering free, And forth into the world with me! I tell you what;--your speculative churl Is like a beast which some ill spirit leads, On barren wilderness, in ceaseless whirl, While all around lie fair and verdant meads. FAUST But how shall we begin? MEPHISTOPHELES We will go hence with speed, A place of torment this indeed! A precious life, thyself to bore, And some few youngsters evermore! Leave that to neighbour Paunch!--withdraw, Why wilt thou plague thyself with thrashing straw? The very best that thou dost know Thou dar'st not to the striplings show. One in the passage now doth wait! FAUST I'm in no mood to see him now, MEPHISTOPHELES Poor lad! He must be tired, I trow; He must not go disconsolate. Hand me thy cap and gown; the mask Is for my purpose quite first rate. (He changes his dress.) Now leave it to my wit! I ask But quarter of an hour; meanwhile equip, And make all ready for our pleasant trip! (Exit FAUST.) MEPHISTOPHELES (in FAUST'S long gown) Mortal! the loftiest attributes of men, Reason and Knowledge, only thus contemn, Still let the Prince of lies, without control, With shows, and mocking charms delude thy soul, I have thee unconditionally then! Fate hath endow'd him with an ardent mind, Which unrestrain'd still presses on for ever, And whose precipitate endeavour Earth's joys o'erleaping, leaveth them behind. Him will I drag through life's wild waste, Through scenes of vapid dulness, where at last Bewilder'd, he shall falter, and stick fast; And, still to mock his greedy haste, Viands and drink shall float his craving lips beyond-- Vainly he'll seek refreshment, anguish-tost, And were he not the devil's by his bond, Yet must his soul infallibly be lost! A STUDENT enters STUDENT But recently I've quitted home, Full of devotion am I come A man to know and hear, whose name With reverence is known to fame. MEPHISTOPHELES Your courtesy much flatters me! A man like other men you see; Pray have you yet applied elsewhere? STUDENT I would entreat your friendly care! I've youthful blood and courage high; Of gold I bring a fair supply; To let me go my mother was not fain; But here I longed true knowledge to attain. MEPHISTOPHELES You've hit upon the very place. STUDENT And yet my steps I would retrace. These walls, this melancholy room, O'erpower me with a sense of gloom; The space is narrow, nothing green, No friendly tree is to be seen: And in these halls, with benches filled, distraught, Sight, hearing fail me, and the power of thought. MEPHISTOPHELES It all depends on habit. Thus at first The infant takes not kindly to the breast, But before long, its eager thirst Is fain to slake with hearty zest: Thus at the breasts of wisdom day by day With keener relish you'll your thirst allay. STUDENT Upon her neck I fain would hang with joy; To reach it, say, what means must I employ? MEPHISTOPHELES Explain, ere further time we lose, What special faculty you choose? STUDENT Profoundly learned I would grow, What heaven contains would comprehend, O'er earth's wide realm my gaze extend, Nature and science I desire to know. MEPHISTOPHELES You are upon the proper track, I find; Take heed, let nothing dissipate your mind. STUDENT My heart and soul are in the chase! Though to be sure I fain would seize, On pleasant summer holidays, A little liberty and careless ease. MEPHISTOPHELES Use well your time, so rapidly it flies; Method will teach you time to win; Hence, my young friend, I would advise, With college logic to begin! Then will your mind be so well braced, In Spanish boots so tightly laced, That on 'twill circumspectly creep, Thought's beaten track securely keep, Nor will it, ignis-fatuus like, Into the path of error strike. Then many a day they'll teach you how The mind's spontaneous acts, till now As eating and as drinking free, Require a process;--one! two! three! In truth the subtle web of thought Is like the weaver's fabric wrought: One treadle moves a thousand lines, Swift dart the shuttles to and fro, Unseen the threads together flow, A thousand knots one stroke combines. Then forward steps your sage to show, And prove to you, it must be so; The first being so, and so the second, The third and fourth deduc'd we see; And if there were no first and second, Nor third nor fourth would ever be. This, scholars of all countries prize,-- Yet 'mong themselves no weavers rise.-- He who would know and treat of aught alive, Seeks first the living spirit thence to drive: Then are the lifeless fragments in his hand, There only fails, alas the spirit-band. This process, chemists name, in learned thesis, Mocking themselves, Naturer encheiresis. STUDENT Your words I cannot fully comprehend. MEPHISTOPHELES In a short time you will improve, my friend, When of scholastic forms you learn the use; And how by method all things to reduce. STUDENT So doth all this my brain confound, As if a mill-wheel there were turning round. MEPHISTOPHELES And next, before aught else you learn, You must with zeal to metaphysics turn! There see that you profoundly comprehend, What doth the limit of man's brain transcend; For that which is or is not in the head A sounding phrase will serve you in good stead. But before all strive this half year From one fix'd order ne'er to swerve! Five lectures daily you must hear; The hour still punctually observe! Yourself with studious zeal prepare, And closely in your manual look, Hereby may you be quite aware That all he utters standeth in the book; Yet write away without cessation, As at the Holy Ghost's dictation! STUDENT This, Sir, a second time you need not say! Your counsel I appreciate quite; What we possess in black and white, We can in peace and comfort bear away. MEPHISTOPHELES A faculty I pray you name. STUDENT For jurisprudence, Some distaste I own. MEPHISTOPHELES To me this branch of science is well known, And hence I cannot your repugnance blame. Customs and laws in every place, Like a disease, an heir-loom dread, Still trail their curse from race to race, And furtively abroad they spread. To nonsense, reason's self they turn; Beneficence becomes a pest; Woe unto thee, that thou'rt a grandson born! As for the law born with us, unexpressed;-- That law, alas, none careth to discern. STUDENT You deepen my dislike. The youth Whom you instruct, is blest in sooth! To try theology I feel inclined. MEPHISTOPHELES I would not lead you willingly astray, But as regards this science, you will find So hard it is to shun the erring way, And so much hidden poison lies therein, Which scarce can you discern from medicine. Here too it is the best, to listen but to one, And by the master's words to swear alone. To sum up all--To words hold fast! Then the safe gate securely pass'd, You'll reach the lane of certainty at last. STUDENT But then some meaning must the words convey. MEPHISTOPHELES Right! But o'er-anxious thought, you'll find of no avail, For there precisely where ideas fail, A word comes opportunely into play Most admirable weapons words are found, On words a system we securely ground, In words we can conveniently believe, Nor of a single jot can we a word bereave. STUDENT Your pardon for my importunity; Yet once more must I trouble you: On medicine, I'll thank you to supply A pregnant utterance or two! Three years! how brief the appointed tide! The field, heaven knows, is all too wide! If but a friendly hint be thrown, 'Tis easier then to feel one's way. MEPHISTOPHELES (aside) I'm weary of the dry pedantic tone, And must again the genuine devil play. (Aloud) Of medicine the spirit's caught with ease, The great and little world you study through, That things may then their course pursue, As heaven may please. In vain abroad you range through science' ample space, Each man learns only that which learn he can; Who knows the moment to embrace, He is your proper man. In person you are tolerably made, Nor in assurance will you be deficient: Self-confidence acquire, be not afraid, Others will then esteem you a proficient. Learn chiefly with the sex to deal! Their thousands ahs and ohs, These the sage doctor knows, He only from one point can heal. Assume a decent tone of courteous ease, You have them then to humour as you please. First a diploma must belief infuse, That you in your profession take the lead: You then at once those easy freedoms use For which another many a year must plead; Learn how to feel with nice address The dainty wrist;--and how to press, With ardent furtive glance, the slender waist, To feel how tightly it is laced. STUDENT There is some sense in that! one sees the how and why. MEPHISTOPHELES Grey is, young friend, all theory: And green of life the golden tree. STUDENT I swear it seemeth like a dream to me. May I some future time repeat my visit, To hear on what your wisdom grounds your views? MEPHISTOPHELES Command my humble service when you choose. STUDENT Ere I retire, one boon I must solicit: Here is my album, do not, Sir, deny This token of your favour! MEPHISTOPHELES Willingly! (He writes and returns the book.) STUDENT (reads) ERITIS SICUT DEUS, SCIENTES BONUM ET MALUM (He reverently closes the book and retires.) MEPHISTOPHELES Let but this ancient proverb be your rule, My cousin follow still, the wily snake, And with your likeness to the gods, poor fool, Ere long be sure your poor sick heart will quake! FAUST (enters) Whither away? MEPHISTOPHELES 'Tis thine our course to steer. The little world, and then the great we'll view. With what delight, what profit too, Thou'lt revel through thy gay career! FAUST Despite my length of beard I need The easy manners that insure success; Th' attempt I fear can ne'er succeed; To mingle in the world I want address; I still have an embarrass'd air, and then I feel myself so small with other men. MEPHISTOPHELES Time, my good friend, will all that's needful give; Be only self-possessed, and thou hast learn'd to live. FAUST But how are we to start, I pray? Steeds, servants, carriage, where are they? MEPHISTOPHELES We've but to spread this mantle wide, 'Twill serve whereon through air to ride, No heavy baggage need you take, When we our bold excursion make, A little gas, which I will soon prepare, Lifts us from earth; aloft through air, Light laden, we shall swiftly steer;-- I wish you joy of your new life-career. AUERBACH'S CELLAR IN LEIPZIG A Drinking Party FROSCH No drinking? Naught a laugh to raise? None of your gloomy looks, I pray! You, who so bright were wont to blaze, Are dull as wetted straw to-day. BRANDER 'Tis all your fault; your part you do not bear, No beastliness, no folly. FROSCH (pours a glass of wine over his head) There, You have them both! BRANDER You double beast! FROSCH 'Tis what you ask'd me for, at least! SIEBEL Whoever quarrels, turn him out! With open throat drink, roar, and shout. Hollo! Hollo! Ho! ALTMAYER Zounds, fellow, cease your deaf'ning cheers! Bring cotton-wool! He splits my ears. SIEBEL 'Tis when the roof rings back the tone, Then first the full power of the bass is known. FROSCH Right! out with him who takes offence! A! tara lara da! ALTMAYER A! tara lara da! FROSCH Our throats are tuned. Come let's commence! (Sings) The holy Roman empire now, How holds it still together? BRANDER An ugly song! a song political! A song offensive! Thank God, every morn To rule the Roman empire, that you were not born! I bless my stars at least that mine is not Either a kaiser's or a chancellor's lot. Yet 'mong ourselves should one still lord it o'er the rest; That we elect a pope I now suggest. Ye know, what quality ensures A man's success, his rise secures. Faoscn (sings) Bear, lady nightingale above, Ten thousand greetings to my love. SIESEL No greetings to a sweetheart! No love-songs shall there be! FROSCH Love-greetings and love-kisses! Thou shalt not hinder me! (Sings) Undo the bolt! in silly night, Undo the bolt! the lover wakes. Shut to the bolt! when morning breaks, SIEBEL Ay, sing, sing on, praise her with all, thy might!! My turn to laugh will come some day. Me hath she jilted once, you the same trick she'll play. Some gnome her lover be! where cross-roads meet, With her to play the fool; or old he-goat, From Blocksberg coming in swift gallop, bleat A good night to her, from his hairy throat! A proper lad of genuine flesh and blood, Is for the damsel far too good; The greeting she shall have from me, To smash her window-panes will be! BRANDER (striking on the table) Silence! Attend! to me give ear! Confess, sirs, I know how to live: Some love-sick folk are sitting here! Hence, 'tis but fit, their hearts to cheer, That I a good-night strain to them should give. Hark! of the newest fashion is my song! Strike boldly in the chorus, clear and strong! (He sings) Once in a cellar lived a rat, He feasted there on butter, Until his paunch became as fat As that of Doctor Luther, The cook laid poison for the guest, Then was his heart with pangs oppress'd, As if his frame love wasted. Chorus (shouting) As if his frame love wasted. BRANDER He ran around, he ran abroad, Of every puddle drinking. The house with rage he scratch'd and gnaw'd, In vain,--he fast was Sinking; Full many an anguish'd bound he gave, Nothing the hapless brute could save, As if his frame love wasted. CHORUS As if his frame love wasted. BRANDER By torture driven, in open day, The kitchen he invaded, Convulsed upon the hearth he lay, With anguish sorely jaded; The poisoner laugh'd, Ha! ha! quoth she, His life is ebbing fast, I see, As if his frame love wasted. CHORUS As if his frame love wasted. SIEBEL How the dull boors exulting shout! Poison for the poor rats to strew A fine exploit it is no doubt. BRANDER They, as it seems, stand well with you! ALTMAYER Old bald-pate! with the paunch profound! The rat's mishap hath tamed his nature; For he his counterpart bath found Depicted in the swollen creature. FAUST AND MEPHISTOPHELES MEPHISTOPHELES I now must introduce to you Before aught else, this jovial crew, To show how lightly life may glide away; With the folk here each day's a holiday. With little wit and much content, Each on his own small round intent, Like sportive kitten with its tail; While no sick-headache they bewail, And while their host will credit give, Joyous and free from care they live. BRANDER They're off a journey, that is clear,-- From their strange manners; they have scarce been here An hour. FROSCH You're right! Leipzig's the place for me 'Tis quite a little Paris; people there Acquire a certain easy finish'd air. SIEBEL What take you now these travellers to be? FROSCH Let me alone! O'er a full glass you'll see, As easily I'll worm their secret out, As draw an infant's tooth. I've not a doubt That my two gentlemen are nobly born, They look dissatisfied and full of scorn. BRANDER They are but mountebanks, I'll lay a bet! ALTMAYER Most like. FROSCH Mark me, I'll screw it from them yet! MEPHISTOPHELES (to FAUST) These fellows would not scent the devil out, E'en though he had them by the very throat! FAUST SIEBEL Thanks for your fair salute. (Aside, glancing at MEPHISTOPHELES.) How! goes the fellow on a halting foot? MEPHISTOPHELES Is it permitted here with you to sit? Then though good wine is not forthcoming here, Good company at least our hearts will cheer. ALTMAYER A dainty gentleman, no doubt of it. FROSCH You're doubtless recently from Rippach? Pray, Did you with Master Hans there chance to sup? MEPHISTOPHELES To-day we pass'd him, but we did not stop! When last we met him he had much to say Touching his cousins, and to each he sent Full many a greeting and kind compliment. (With an inclination towards FROSCH.) ALTMAYER (aside to FROSCH) You have it there! SIEBEL Faith! he's a knowing one! FROSCH Have patience! I will show him up anon! MEPHISTOPHELES We heard erewhile, unless I'm wrong, Voices well trained in chorus pealing? Certes, most choicely here must song Re-echo from this vaulted ceiling! FROSCH That you're an amateur one plainly sees! MEPHISTOPHELES Oh no, though strong the love, I cannot boast much skill. ALTMAYER Give us a song! MEPHISTOPHELES As many as you will. SIEBEL But be it a brand new one, if you please! MEPHISTOPHELES But recently returned from Spain are we, The pleasant land of wine and minstrelsy. (Sings) A king there was once reigning, Who had a goodly flea-- FROSCH Hark! did you rightly catch the words? a flea! An odd sort of a guest he needs must be. MEPHISTOPHELES (sings) A king there was once reigning, Who had a goodly flea, Him loved he without feigning, As his own son were he! His tailor then he summon'd, The tailor to him goes: Now measure me the youngster For jerkin and for hose! BRANDER Take proper heed, the tailor strictly charge, The nicest measurement to take, And as he loves his head, to make The hose quite smooth and not too large! MEPHISTOPHELES In satin and in velvet, Behold the yonker dressed; Bedizen'd o'er with ribbons, A cross upon his breast. Prime minister they made him, He wore a star of state; And all his poor relations Were courtiers, rich and great. The gentlemen and ladies At court were sore distressed; The queen and all her maidens Were bitten by the pest, And yet they dared not scratch them, Or chase the fleas away. If we are bit, we catch them, And crack without delay. CHORUS (shouting) If we are bit, &c. FROSCH Bravo! That's the song for me! SIEBEL Such be the fate of every flea! BRANDER With Clever finger catch and Kill! ALTMAYER Hurrah for wine and freedom still! MEPHISTOPHELES Were but your wine a trifle better, friend, A glass to freedom I would gladly drain. SIEBEL You'd better not repeat those words again t MEPHISTOPHELES I am afraid the landlord to offend; Else freely I would treat each worthy guest From our own cellar to the very best. SIEBEL Out with it then! Your doings I'll defend. FROSCH Give a good glass, and straight we'll praise you, one and all. Only let not your samples be too small; For if my judgment you desire, Certes, an ample mouthful I require. ALTMAYER (aside) I guess they're from the Rhenish land. MEPHISTOPHELES Fetch me a gimlet here! BRANDER Say, what therewith to bore? You cannot have the wine-casks at the door? ALTMAYER Our landlord's tool-basket behind doth yonder stand. MEPHISTOPHELES (takes the gimlet) (To FROSCH) Now only say! what liquor will you take? FROSCH How mean you that? have you of every sort? MEPHISTOPHELES Each may his own selection make. ALTMAYER (to FROSCH) Ha! Ha! You lick your lips already at the thought. FROSCH Good, if I have my choice, the Rhenish I propose; For still the fairest gifts the fatherland bestows. MEPHISTOPHELES (boring a hole in the edge of the table opposite to where FROSCH is sitting) Give me a little wax--and make some stoppers--quick! ALTMAYER Why, this is nothing but a juggler's trick! MEPHISTOPHELES (to BRANDER) And you? BRANDER Champagne's the wine for me; Right brisk, and sparkling let it be! (MEPHISTOPHELES bores; one of the party has in the meantime prepared the wax-stoppers and stopped the holes.) BRANDER What foreign is one always can't decline, What's good is often scatter'd far apart. The French your genuine German hates with all his heart, Yet has a relish for their wine. SIEBEL. (as MEPHISTOPHELES approaches him) I like not acid wine, I must allow, Give me a glass of genuine sweet! MEPHISTOPHELES (bored) Tokay Shall, if you wish it, flow without delay. ALTMAYER Come! look me in the face! no fooling now! You are but making fun of us, I trow. MEPHISTOPHELES Ah! ah! that would indeed be making free With such distinguished guests. Come, no delay; What liquor can I serve you with, I pray? ALTMAYER Only be quick, it matters not to me. (After the holes are bored and stopped.) MEPHISTOPHELES (with strange gestures) Grapes the vine-stock bears, Horns the buck-goat wears! Wine is sap, the vine is wood, The wooden board yields wine as good. With a deeper glance and true The mysteries of nature view! Have faith and here's a miracle! Your stoppers draw and drink your fill! ALL. (as they draw the stoppers and the wine chosen by each runs into his glass) Oh beauteous spring, which flows so far! MEPHISTOPHELES Spill not a single drop, of this beware! (They drink repeatedly.) ALL (sing) Happy as cannibals are we, Or as five hundred swine. MEPHISTOPHELES They're in their glory, mark their elevation! FAUST Let's hence, nor here our stay prolong. MEPHISTOPHELES Attend, of brutishness ere long You'll see a glorious revelation. SIEBEL (drinks carelessly; the wine is spilt upon the ground, and turns to flame) Help! fire! help! Hell is burning! MEPHISTOPHELES (addressing the flames) Stop, Kind element, be still, I say! (To the Company.) SIEBEL What means the knave! For this you'll dearly pay! Us, it appears, you do not know. FROSCH Such tricks a second time he'd better show! ALTMAYER Methinks 'twere well we pack'd him quietly away. SIEBEL What, sir! with us your hocus-pocus play! MEPHISTOPHELES Silence, old wine-cask! SIEBEL How! add insult, too! Vile broomstick! BRANDER Hold, or blows shall rain on you! ALTMAYER (draws a stopper out of the table; fire springs out against him) I burn! I burn! SIEBEL 'Tis sorcery, I vow! Strike home! The fellow is fair game, I trow! (They draw their knives and attack MEPHISTOPHELES.) MEPHISTOPHELES (with solemn gestures) Visionary scenes appear! Words delusive cheat the ear! Be ye there, and be ye here! (They stand amazed and gaze at each other.) ALTMAYER Where am I? What a beauteous land! FROSCH Vineyards! unless my sight deceives? SIEBEL And clust'ring grapes too, close at hand! BRANDER And underneath the spreading leaves, What stems there be! What grapes I see! (He senses SIEBEL by the nose. The others reciprocally do the same, and raise their knives.) MEPHISTOPHELES (as above) Delusion, from their eyes the bandage take! Note how the devil loves a jest to break! (He disappears with FAUST; the fellows draw back from one another.) SIEBEL What was it? ALTMAYER How? FROSCH Was that your nose? BRANDER (to SIEBEL) And look, my hand doth thine enclose! ALTMAYER I felt a shock, it went through every limb! A chair! I'm fainting! All things swim! FROSCH Say what has happened, what's it all about? SIEBEL Where is the fellow? Could I scent him out, His body from his soul I'd soon divide! ALTMAYER With my own eyes, upon a cask astride, Forth through the cellar-door I saw him ride-- Heavy as lead my feet are growing. (Turning to the table.) I wonder is the wine still flowing! SIEBEL 'Twas all delusion, cheat and lie. FROSCH 'Twas wine I drank, most certainly. BRANDER But with the grapes how was it, pray? ALTMAYER That none may miracles believe, who now will say? WITCHES' KITCHEN A large caldron hangs over the fire on a low hearth; various figures appear in the vapour rising from it. A FEMALE MONKEY sits beside the caldron to skim it, and watch that it does not boil over. The MALE MONKEY with the young ones is seated near, warming himself. The walls and ceiling are adorned with the strangest articles of witch-furniture. FAUST, MEPHISTOPHELES FAUST This senseless, juggling witchcraft I detest! Dost promise that in this foul nest Of madness, I shall be restored? Must I seek counsel from an ancient dame? And can she, by these rites abhorred, Take thirty winters from my frame? Woe's me, if thou naught better canst suggest! Hope has already fled my breast. Has neither nature nor a noble mind A balsam yet devis'd of any kind? MEPHISTOPHELES My friend, you now speak sensibly. In truth, Nature a method giveth to renew thy youth: But in another book the lesson's writ;-- It forms a curious chapter, I admit. FAUST I fain would know it. MEPHISTOPHELES Good! A remedy Without physician, gold, or sorcery: Away forthwith, and to the fields repair, Begin to delve, to cultivate the ground, Thy senses and thyself confine Within the very narrowest round, Support thyself upon the simplest fare, Live like a very brute the brutes among, Neither esteem it robbery The acre thou dost reap, thyself to dung; This is the best method, credit me, Again at eighty to grow hale and young. FAUST I am not used to it, nor can myself degrade So far, as in my hand to take the spade. This narrow life would suit me not at all. MEPHISTOPHELES Then we the witch must summon after all. FAUST Will none but this old beldame do? Canst not thyself the potion brew? MEPHISTOPHELES A pretty play our leisure to beguile! A thousand bridges I could build meanwhile. Not science only and consummate art, Patience must also bear her part. A quiet spirit worketh whole years long; Time only makes the subtle ferment strong. And all things that belong thereto, Are wondrous and exceeding rare! The devil taught her, it is true; But yet the draught the devil can't prepare. (Perceiving the beasts.) Look yonder, what a dainty pair! Here is the maid! the knave is there! (To the beasts) It seems your dame is not at home? THE MONKEYS Gone to carouse, Out of the house, Thro' the chimney and away! MEPHISTOPHELES How long is it her wont to roam? THE MONKEYS While we can warm our paws she'll stay. MEPHISTOPHELES (to FAUST) What think you of the charming creature? FAUST I loathe alike their form and features! MEPHISTOPHELES Nay, such discourse, be it confessed, Is just the thing that pleases me the best. (To the MONKEYS) Tell me, ye whelps, accursed crew! What Stir ye in the broth about? MONKEYS Coarse beggar's gruel here we stew. MEPHISTOPHELES Of customers you'll have a rout. THE HE-MONKEY (approaching and fawning on MEPHISTOPHELES) Quick! quick! throw the dice, Make me rich in a trice, Oh give me the prize! Alas, for myself! Had I plenty of pelf, I then should be wise. MEPHISTOPHELES How blest the ape would think himself, if he Could only put into the lottery! (In the meantime the young MONKEYS have been playing with a large globe, which they roll forwards) THE HE-MONKEY The world behold; Unceasingly roll'd, It riseth and falleth ever; It ringeth like glass! How brittle, alas! 'Tis hollow, and resteth never. How bright the sphere, Still brighter here! Now living am I! Dear son, beware! Nor venture there! Thou too must die! It is of clay; 'Twill crumble away; There fragments lie. MEPHISTOPHELES Of what use is the sieve? THE HE-MONKEY (taking it dozen) The sieve would show, If thou wert a thief or no? (He runs to the SHE-MONKEY, and makes her look through it.) Look through the sieve! Dost know him the thief, And dar'st thou not call him so? MEPHISTOPHELES (approaching the fire) And then this pot? THE MONKEYS The half-witted sot! He knows not the pot! He knows not the kettle! MEPHISTOPHELES Unmannerly beast! Be civil at least! THE HE-MONKEY Take the whisk and sit down in the settle! (He makes MEPHISTOPHELES sit down.) FAUST (who all this time has been standing before a looking-glass, now approaching, and now retiring from it) What do I see? what form, whose charms transcend The loveliness of earth, is mirror'd here! O Love, to waft me to her sphere, To me the swiftest of thy pinions lend! Alas! If I remain not rooted to this place, If to approach more near I'm fondly lur'd, Her image fades, in veiling mist obscur'd Model of beauty both in form and face! Is't possible? Hath woman charms so rare? In this recumbent form, supremely fair, The essence must I see of heavenly grace? Can aught so exquisite on earth be found? MEPHISTOPHELES The six days' labour of a god, my friend, Who doth himself cry bravo, at the end, By something clever doubtless should be crown'd. For this time gaze your fill, and when you please Just such a prize for you I can provide; How blest is he to whom kind fate decrees, To take her to his home, a lovely bride! (FAUST continues to gaze into the mirror. MEPHISTOPHELES stretching himself on the settle and playing with the whisk, continues to speak.) Here sit I, like a king upon his throne; My sceptre this;--the crown I want alone. THE MONKEYS (who have hitherto been making all sorts of strange gestures, bring MEPHISTOPHELES a crown, with loud cries) Oh, be so good, With Sweat and with blood The crown to lime! (They handle the crown awkwardly and break it in two pieces, with which they skip about.) 'Twas fate's decree! We speak and see! We hear and rhyme. FAUST (before the mirror) Woe's me! well-nigh distraught I feel! MEPHISTOPHELES (pointing to the beasts) And even my own head almost begins to reel. THE MONKEYS If good luck attend, If fitly things blend, Our jargon with thought And with reason is fraught! FAUST (as above) A flame is kindled in my breast! Let us begone! nor linger here! MEPHISTOPT'IELES (in the same position) It now at least must be confessed, That poets sometimes are sincere. (The caldron begins to boil over; a great flame arises, which streams up the chimney. The WITCH comes down the chimney with horrible cries.) THE WITCH Ough! ough! ough! ough! Accursed brute! accursed SOW! The caldron dost neglect, for shame! Accursed brute to scorch the dame! (Perceiving FAUST and MEPHISTOPHELES) Whom have we here? Who's sneaking here? Whence are ye come? With what desire? The plague of fire Your bones consume! (She dips the skimming-ladle into the caldron and throws flames at FAUST, MEPHISTOPHELES, and the MONKEYS. The MONKEYS whimper.) MEPHISTOPHELES (twirling the whisk which he holds in his hand, and striking among the glasses and pots) Dash! Smash! There lies the glass! There lies the slime! 'Tis but a jest; I but keep time, Thou hellish pest, To thine own chime! (While the WITCH steps back in rage aind astonishment.) Dost know me! Skeleton! Vile scarecrow, thou! Thy lord and master dost thou know? What holds me, that I deal not now Thee and thine apes a stunning blow? No more respect to my red vest dost pay? Does my cock's feather no allegiance claim? Have I my visage masked to-day? Must I be forced myself to name? THE WITCH Master, forgive this rude salute! But I perceive no cloven foot. And your two ravens, where are they? MEPHISTOPHELES This once I must admit your plea;-- For truly I must own that we Each other have not seen for many a day. The culture, too, that shapes the world, at last Hath e'en the devil in its sphere embraced; The northern phantom from the scene hath pass'd, Tail, talons, horns, are nowhere to be traced! As for the foot, with which I can't dispense, 'Twould injure me in company, and hence, Like many a youthful cavalier, False calves I now have worn for many a year. THE WITCH (dancing) I am beside myself with joy, To see once more the gallant Satan here! MEPHISTOPHELES Woman, no more that name employ! THE WITCH But why? what mischief hath it done? MEPHISTOPHELES To fable-books it now doth appertain; But people from the change have nothing won. Rid of the evil one, the evil ones remain. Lord Baron call thou me, so is the matter good; Of other cavaliers the mien I wear. Dost make no question of my gentle blood; See here, this is the scutcheon that I bear! (He makes an unseemly gesture.) THE WITCH (laughing immoderately) Ha! Ha Just like yourself! You are, I ween, The same mad wag that you have ever been! MEPHISTOPHELES (to FAUST) My friend, learn this to understand, I pray! To deal with witches this is still the way. THE WITCH Now tell me, gentlemen, what you desire? MEPHISTOPHELES Of your known juice a goblet we require. But for the very oldest let me ask; Double its strength with years doth grow. THE WITCH Most willingly! And here I have a flask, From which I've sipp'd myself ere now; What's more, it doth no longer stink; To you a glass I joyfully will give. (Aside.) If unprepar'd, however, this man drink, He hath not, as you know, an hour to live. MEPHISTOPHELES He's my good friend, with whom 'twill prosper well; I grudge him not the choicest of thy store. Now draw thy circle, speak thy spell, And straight a bumper for him pour! (The WITCH, with extraordinary gestures, describes a circle, and places strange things within it. The glasses meanwhile begin to ring, the caldron to sound, and to make music. Lastly, she brings a great book; places the MONKEYS in the circle to serve her as a desk, and to hold the torches. She beckons FAUST to approach.) FAUST (to MEPHISTOPHELES) Tell me, to what doth all this tend? Where will these frantic gestures end? This loathsome cheat, this senseless stuff I've known and hated long enough. MEPHISTOPHELES Mere mummery, a laugh to raise! Pray don't be so fastidious! She But as a leech, her hocus-pocus plays, That well with you her potion may agree. (He compels FAUST to enter the circle.) (The WITCH, with great emphasis, begins to declaim the book.) This must thou ken: Of one make ten, Pass two, and then Make square the three, So rich thou'lt be. Drop out the four! From five and six, Thus says the witch, Make seven and eight. So all is straight! And nine is one, And ten is none, This is the witch's one-time-one! FAUST The hag doth as in fever rave. MEPHISTOPHELES To these will follow many a stave. I know it well, so rings the book throughout; Much time I've lost in puzzling o'er its pages, For downright paradox, no doubt, A mystery remains alike to fools and sages. Ancient the art and modern too, my friend. 'Tis still the fashion as it used to be, Error instead of truth abroad to send By means of three and one, and one and three. 'Tis ever taught and babbled in the schools. Who'd take the trouble to dispute with fools? When words men hear, in sooth, they usually believe. That there must needs therein be something to conceive. THE WITCH (continues) The lofty power Of wisdom's dower, From all the world conceal'd! Who thinketh not, To him I wot, Unsought it is reveal'd. FAUST What nonsense doth the hag propound? My brain it doth well-nigh confound. A hundred thousand fools or more, Methinks I hear in chorus roar. MEPHISTOPHELES Incomparable Sibyl cease, I pray! Hand us thy liquor without more delay. And to the very brim the goblet crown! My friend he is, and need not be afraid; Besides, he is a man of many a grade, Who bath drunk deep already. (The WITCH, with many ceremonies, pours the liquor into a cup; as FAUST lifts it to his mouth, a light flame arises.) MEPHISTOPHELES Gulp it down! No hesitation! It will prove A cordial, and your heart inspire! What! with the devil hand and glove, And yet shrink back afraid of fire? (The WITCH dissolves the circle. FAUST steps Out.) MEPHISTOPHELES Now forth at once! thou dar'st not rest. WITCH And much, sir, may the liquor profit you! MEPHISTOPHELES (to the WITCH) And if to pleasure thee I aught can do, Pray on Walpurgis mention thy request. WITCH Here is a song, sung o'er, sometimes you'll see, That 'twill a singular effect produce. MEPHISTOPHELES (to FAUST) Come, quick, and let thyself be led by me; Thou must perspire, in order that the juice Thy frame may penetrate through every part. Then noble idleness I thee will teach to prize, And soon with ecstasy thou'lt recognise How Cupid stirs and gambols in thy heart. FAUST Let me but gaze one moment in the glass! Too lovely was that female form! MEPHISTOPHELES Nay! nay! A model which all women shall surpass, In flesh and blood ere long thou shalt survey. As works the draught, thou presently shalt greet A Helen in each woman thou dost meet. A STREET FAUST (MARGARET passing by) FAUST Fair lady, may I thus make free To offer you my arm and company? MARGARET I am no lady, am not fair, Can without escort home repair. (She disengages herself and exit.) FAUST By heaven! This girl is fair indeed! No form like hers can I recall. Virtue she hath, and modest heed, Is piquant too, and sharp withal. Her cheek's soft light, her rosy lips, No length of time will e'er eclipse! Her downward glance in passing by, Deep in my heart is stamp'd for aye; How curt and sharp her answer too, To ecstasy the feeling grew! (MEPHISTOPHZLES enters.) FAUST This girl must win for me! Dost hear? MEPHISTOPHELES Which? FAUST She who but now passed. MEPHISTOPHELES She from confession coineth here, From every sin absolved and free; I crept near the confessor's chair. All innocence her virgin soul, For next to nothing went she there; O'er such as she I've no control! FAUST She's past fourteen. MEPHISTOPHELES You really talk Like any gay Lothario, Who every floweret from its stalk Would pluck, and deems nor grace, nor truth, Secure against his arts, forsooth! This ne'er the less won't always do. FAUST Sir Moralizer, prithee, pause; Nor plague me with your tiresome laws! To cut the matter short, my friend, She must this very night be mine,-- And if to help me you decline, Midnight shall see our compact end. MEPHISTOPHELES What may occur just bear in mind! A fortnight's space, at least, I need, A fit occasion but to find. FAUST With but Seven hours I could succeed; Nor should I want the devil's wile, So young a creature to beguile. MEPHISTOPHELES Like any Frenchman now you speak, But do not fret, I pray; why seek To hurry to enjoyment straight? The pleasure is not half so great, As when at first around, above, With all the fooleries of love, The puppet you can knead and mould As in Italian story oft is told. FAUST No such incentives do I need. MEPHISTOPHELES But now, without offence or jest! You cannot quickly, I protest, In winning this sweet child succeed. By storm we cannot take the fort, To stratagem we must resort. FAUST Conduct me to her place of rest! Some token of the angel bring! A kerchief from her snowy breast, A garter bring me,--any thing! MEPHISTOPHELES That I my anxious zeal may prove, Your pangs to sooth and aid your love, A single moment will we not delay, Will lead you to her room this very day. FAUST And shall I see her ?--Have her? MEPHISTOPHELES No! She to a neighbour's house will go; But in her atmosphere alone, The tedious hours meanwhile you may employ, In blissful dreams of future joy. FAUST Can we go now? MEPHISTOPHELES 'Tis yet too soon. FAUST Some present for my love procure! (Exit.) MEPHISTOPHELES Presents so soon! 'tis well! success is sure! Full many a goodly place I know, And treasures buried long ago; I must a bit o'erlook them now. (Exit.) EVENING. A SMALL AND NEAT ROOM MARGARET (braiding and binding up her hair) I would give something now to know, Who yonder gentleman could be! He had a gallant air, I trow, And doubtless was of high degree: That written on his brow was seen-- Nor else would lie so bold have been. (Exit.) MEPHISTOPHELES Come in! tread softly! be discreet! FAUST (after a pause) Begone and leave me, I entreat! MEPHISTOPHELES (looking round) Not every maiden is so neat. FAUST (gazing round) Welcome sweet twilight, calm and blest, That in this hallow'd precinct reigns! Fond yearning love, inspire my breast, Feeding on hope's sweet dew thy blissful pains! What stillness here environs me! Content and order brood around. What fulness in this poverty! In this small cell what bliss profound! (He throws himself on the leather arm-chair beside the bed.) Receive me thou, who hast in thine embrace, Welcom'd in joy and grief the ages flown! How oft the children of a by-gone race Have cluster'd round this patriarchal throne! Haply she, also, whom I hold so dear, For Christmas gift, with grateful joy possess'd, Hath with the full round cheek of childhood, here, Her grandsire's wither'd hand devoutly press'd. Maiden! I feel thy spirit haunt the place, Breathing of order and abounding grace. As with a mother's voice it prompteth thee, The pure white cover o'er the board to spread, To strew the crisping sand beneath thy tread. Dear hand! so godlike in its ministry! The hut becomes a paradise through thee! And here (He raises the bed-curtain.) How thrills my pulse with strange delight! Here could I linger hours untold; Thou, Nature, didst in vision bright, The embryo angel here unfold. Here lay the child, her bosom warm With life; while steeped in slumber's dew, To perfect grace, her godlike form, With pure and hallow'd weavings grew! And thou! ah here what seekest thou? How quails mine inmost being now! What wouldst thou here? what makes thy heart so sore? Unhappy Faust! I know thee now no more. Do I a magic atmosphere inhale? Erewhile, my passion would not brook delay! Now in a pure love-dream I melt away. Are we the sport of every passing gale? Should she return and enter now, How wouldst thou rue thy guilty flame! Proud vaunter--thou wouldst hide thy brow,-- And at her feet sink down with shame. MEPHISTOPHELES Quick! quick! below I see her there. FAUST Away! I will return no more! MEPHISTOPHELES Here is a casket, with a store Of jewels, which I got elsewhere. Just lay it in the press; make haste! I swear to you, 'twill turn her brain; Therein some trifles I have placed, Wherewith another to obtain. But child is child, and play is play. FAUST I know not--shall I? MEPHISTOPHELES Do you ask? Perchance you would retain the treasure? If such your wish, why then, I say, Henceforth absolve me from my task, Nor longer waste your hours of leisure. I trust you're not by avarice led! I rub my hands, I scratch my head,-- (He places the casket in the press and closes the lock,) Now quick! Away! That soon the sweet young creature may The wish and purpose of your heart obey; Yet stand you there As would you to the lecture-room repair, As if before you stood, Arrayed in flesh and blood, Physics and metaphysics weird and grey!-- Away!     (Exeunt.) MARGARET (with a lamp) Here 'tis so close, so sultry now, (She opens the window.) Yet out of doors 'tis not so warm. I feel so strange, I know not how-- I wish my mother would come home. Through me there runs a shuddering-- I'm but a foolish timid thing! (While undressing herself she begins to sing.) There was a king in Thule, True even to the grave; To whom his dying mistress A golden beaker gave. At every feast he drained it, Naught was to him so dear, And often as he drained it, Gush'd from his eyes the tear. When death came, unrepining His cities o'er he told; All to his heir resigning, Except his cup of gold. With many a knightly vassal At a royal feast sat he, In yon proud ball ancestral, In his castle o'er the sea. Up stood the jovial monarch, And quaff'd his last life's glow, Then hurled the hallow'd goblet Into the flood below. He saw it splashing, drinking, And plunging hi the sea; His eyes meanwhile were sinking, And never again drank he. (She opens the press to put away her clothes, and perceives the casket.) How comes this lovely casket here? The press I locked, of that I'm confident. 'Tis very wonderful! What's in it I can't guess; Perhaps 'twas brought by some one in distress. And left in pledge for loan my mother lent. Here by a ribbon hangs a little key! I have a mind to open it and see! Heavens! only look! what have we here! In all my days ne'er saw I such a sight! Jewels! which any noble dame might wear, For some high pageant richly dight! This chain--how would it look on me! These splendid gems, whose may they be? (She puts them on and steps before the glass.) Were but the ear-rings only mine! Thus one has quite another air. What hoots it to be young and fair? It doubtless may be very flue; But then, alas, none cares for you, And praise sounds half like pity too. Gold all doth lure, Gold doth secure All things. Alas, we poor! PROMENADE FAUST walking thoughtfully up and down. To him MEPHISTOPHELES. MEPHISTOPHELES By all rejected love! By hellish fire I curse, Would I knew aught to make my imprecation worse! FAUST What aileth thee? what chafes thee now so sore? A face like that I never saw before! MEPHISTOPHELES I'd yield me to the devil instantly, Did it not happen that myself am he! FAUST There must be some disorder in thy wit! To rave thus like a madman, is it fit? MEPHISTOPHELES Think! only think! The gems for Gretchen brought, Them hath a priest now made his own!-- A glimpse of them the mother caught, And 'gan with secret fear to groan. The woman's scent is keen enough; Doth ever in the prayer-book snuff; Smells every article to ascertain Whether the thing is holy or profane, And scented in the jewels rare, That there was not much blessing there. "My child," she cries, "ill-gotten good Ensnares the soul, consumes the blood; With them we'll deck our Lady's shrine, She'll cheer our souls with bread divine!" At this poor Gretchen 'gan to pout; 'Tis a gift-horse, at least, she thought, And sure, he godless cannot be, Who brought them here so cleverly. Straight for a priest the mother sent, Who, when he understood the jest, With what he saw was well content. "This shows a pious mind!" Quoth he: "Self-conquest is true victory. The Church bath a good stomach, she, with zest, Whole countries hath swallow'd down, And never yet a surfeit known. The Church alone, be it confessed, Daughters, can ill-got wealth digest." FAUST It is a general custom, too. Practised alike by king and jew. MEPHISTOPHELES With that, clasp, chain, and ring, he swept As they were mushrooms; and the casket, Without one word of thanks, he kept, As if of nuts it were a basket. Promised reward in heaven, then forth he hied-- And greatly they were edified. FAUST And Gretchen! MEPHISTOPHELES In unquiet mood Knows neither what she would or should; The trinkets night and day thinks o'er, On him who brought them, dwells still more. FAUST The darling's sorrow grieves me, bring Another set without delay! The first, methinks, was no great thing. MEPHISTOPHELES All's to my gentleman child's play! FAUST Plan all things to achieve my end! Engage the attention of her friend! No milk-and-water devil be, And bring fresh jewels instantly! MEPHISTOPHELES Ay, sir! Most gladly I'll obey. (FAUST exit.) MEPHISTOPHELES Your doting love-sick fool, with ease, Merely his lady-love to please, Sun, moon, and stars in sport would puff away. (Exit.) THE NEIGHBOUR'S HOUSE MARTHA (alone) God pardon my dear husband, he Doth not in truth act well by me! Forth in the world abroad to roam, And leave me on the straw at home. And yet his will I ne'er did thwart, God knows, I lov'd him from my heart. (She weeps.) Perchance he's dead!--oh wretched state!-- Had I but a certificate! (MARGARET comes) MARGARET Dame Martha! MARTHA Gretchen? MARGARET Only think! My knees beneath me well-nigh sink! Within my press I've found to-day, Another case, of ebony. And things--magnificent they are, More costly than the first, by far. MARTHA You must not name it to your mother! It would to shrift, just like the other. MARGARET Nay look at them! now only see! MARTHA (dresses her up) Thou happy creature! MARGARET Woe is me! Them in the street I cannot wear, Or in the church, or any where. MARTHA Come often over here to me, The gems put on quite privately; And then before the mirror walk an hour or so, Thus we shall have our pleasure too. Then suitable occasions we must seize, As at a feast, to show them by degrees: A chain at first, pearl ear-drops then,--your mother Won't see them, or we'll coin some tale or other. MARGARET But, who, I wonder, could the caskets bring? I fear there's something wrong about the thing! (a knock,) MARTHA (peering through the blind) 'Tis a strange gentleman, I see. Come in! (MEPHISTOPHELES enters) MEPHISTOPHELES I've ventur'd to intrude to-day. Ladies, excuse the liberty, I pray. (He steps back respectfully before MARGARET.) After dame Martha Schwerdtlein I inquire! MARTHA 'Tis I. Pray what have you to say to me? MEPHISTOPHELES (aside to her) I know you now,--and therefore will retire; At present you've distinguished company. Pardon the freedom, Madam, with your leave, I will make free to call again at eve. MARTHA (aloud) Why, child, of all strange notions, he For some grand lady taketh thee! MARGARET I am, in truth, of humble blood-- The gentleman is far too good-- Nor gems nor trinkets are my own. MEPHISTOPHELES Oh 'tis not the mere ornaments alone; Her glance and mien far more betray. Rejoiced I am that I may stay. MARTHA Your business, Sir? I long to know MEPHISTOPHELES Would I could happier tidings show! I trust mine errand you'll not let me rue; Your husband's dead, and greeteth you. MARTHA Is dead? True heart! Oh misery! My husband dead! Oh, I shall die! MARGARET Alas! good Martha! don't despair! MEPHISTOPHELES Now listen to the sad affair! MARGARET I for this cause should fear to love. The loss my certain death would prove. MEPHISTOPHELES Joy still must sorrow, sorrow joy attend. MARTHA Proceed, and tell the story of his end! MEPHISTOPHELES At Padua, in St. Anthony's, In holy ground his body lies; Quiet and cool his place of rest, With pious ceremonials blest. MARTHA And had you naught besides to bring? MEPHISTOPHELES Oh yes! one grave and solemn prayer; Let them for him three hundred masses sing! But in my pockets, I have nothing there. MARTHA No trinket! no love-token did he send! What every journeyman safe in his pouch will hoard There for remembrance fondly stored, And rather hungers, rather begs than spend! MEPHISTOPHELES Madam, in truth, it grieves me sore, But he his gold not lavishly bath spent. His failings too he deeply did repent, Ay! and his evil plight bewail'd still more. MARGARET Alas! That men should thus be doomed to woe! I for his soul will many a requiem pray. MEPHISTOPHELES A husband you deserve this very day; A child so worthy to be loved. MARGARET Ah no, That time bath not yet come for me. MEPHISTOPHELES If not a spouse, a gallant let it be. Among heaven's choicest gifts, I place, So sweet a darling to embrace. MARGARET MEPHISTOPHELES Usage or not, it happens so. MARTHA Go on, I pray! MEPHISTOPHELES I stood by his bedside. Something less foul it was than dung; 'Twas straw half rotten; yet, he as a Christian died. And sorely hath remorse his conscience wrung. "Wretch that I was," quoth he, with parting breath, "So to forsake my business and my wife! Ah! the remembrance is my death, Could I but have her pardon in this life! "-- MARTHA (weeping) Dear soul! I've long forgiven him, indeed! MEPHISTOPHELES "Though she, God knows, was more to blame than I." MARTHA He lied! What, on the brink of death to lie! MEPHISTOPHELES If I am skill'd the countenance to read, He doubtless fabled as he parted hence.-- "No time had I to gape, or take my ease," he said, "First to get children, and then get them bread; And bread, too, in the very widest sense; Nor could I eat in peace even my proper share." MARTHA What, all my truth, my love forgotten quite? My weary drudgery by day and night! MEPHISTOPHELES Not so! He thought of you with tender care. Quoth he: "Heaven knows how fervently I prayed, For wife and children when from Malta bound;-- The prayer hath heaven with favour crowned; We took a Turkish vessel which conveyed Rich store of treasure for the Sultan's court; It's own reward our gallant action brought; The captur'd prize was shared among the crew And of the treasure I received my due." MARTHA How? Where? The treasure hath he buried, pray? MEPHISTOPHELES Where the four winds have blown it, who can say? In Naples as he stroll'd, a stranger there,-- A comely maid took pity on my friend; And gave such tokens of her love and care, That he retained them to his blessed end. MARTHA Scoundrel! to rob his children of their bread! And all this misery, this bitter need, Could not his course of recklessness impede! MEPHISTOPHELES Well, he bath paid the forfeit, and is dead. Now were I in your place, my counsel hear; My weeds I'd wear for one chaste year, And for another lover meanwhile would look out. MARTHA Alas, I might search far and near, Not quickly should I find another like my first! There could not be a fonder fool than mine, Only he loved too well abroad to roam; Loved foreign women too, and foreign wine. And loved besides the dice accurs'd. MEPHISTOPHELES All had gone swimmingly, no doubt, Had he but given you at home, On his side, just as wide a range. Upon such terms, to you I swear, Myself with you would gladly rings exchange! MARTHA The gentleman is surely pleas'd to jest! MEPHISTOPIIELES (aside) Now to be off in time, were best! She'd make the very devil marry her. (To MARGARET.) How fares it with your heart? MARGARET How mean you, Sir? MEPHISTOPHELES (aside) The sweet young innocent! (aloud) Ladies, farewell! MARGARET Farewell! MARTHA But ere you leave us, quickly tell! I from a witness fain had heard, Where, how, and when my husband died and was interr'd. To forms I've always been attached indeed, His death I fain would in the journals read. MEPHISTOPHELES Ay, madam, what two witnesses declare Is held as valid everywhere; A gallant friend I have, not far from here, Who will for you before the judge appear. I'll bring him straight. MARTHA I pray you do! MEPHISTOPHELES And this young lady, we shall find her too? A noble youth, far travelled, he Shows to the sex all courtesy. MARGARET I in his presence needs must blush for shame. MEPHISTOPHELES Not in the presence of a crowned king! MARTH A The garden, then, behind my house, we'll name, There we'll await you both this evening. A STREET FAUST. MEPHISTOPHELES FAUST How is it now? How speeds it? Is't in train? MEPHISTOPHELES Bravo! I find you all aflame! Gretchen full soon your own you'll name. This eve, at neighbour Martha's, her you'll meet again; The woman seems expressly made To drive the pimp and gipsy's trade. FAUST Good! MEPHISTOPHELES But from us she something would request. FAUST A favour claims return as this world goes. MEPHISTOPHELES We have on oath but duly to attest, That her dead husband's limbs, outstretch'd, repose In holy ground at Padua. FAUST Sage indeed! So I suppose we straight must journey there! MEPHISTOPHELES Sancta simplicitas! For that no need! Without much knowledge we have but to swear. FAUST If you have nothing better to suggest, Against your plan I must at once protest. MEPHISTOPHELES Oh, holy man! methinks I have you there! In all your life say, have you ne'er False witness borne, until this hour? Have you of God, the world, and all it doth contain, Of man, and that which worketh in his heart and brain, Not definitions given, in words of weight and power, With front unblushing, and a dauntless breast? Yet, if into the depth of things you go, Touching these matters, it must be confess'd, As much as of Herr Schwerdtlein's death you know! FAUST Thou art and dost remain liar and sophist too. MEPHISTOPHELES Ay, if one did not take a somewhat deeper view! To-morrow, in all honour, thou Poor Gretchen wilt befool, and vow Thy soul's deep love, in lover's fashion. FAUST And from my heart. MEPHISTOPHELES All good and fair! Then deathless constancy thou'lt swear; Speak of one all o'ermastering passion,-- Will that too issue from the heart? FAUST Forbear! When passion sways me, and I seek to frame Fit utterance for feeling, deep, intense, And for my frenzy finding no fit name, Sweep round the ample world with every sense, Grasp at the loftiest words to speak my flame, And call the glow, wherewith I burn, Quenchless, eternal, yea, eterne-- Is that of sophistry a devilish play? MEPHISTOPHELES Yet am I right! FAUST Mark this, my friend, And spare my lungs; who would the right maintain, And hath a tongue wherewith his point to gain, Will gain it in the end. But come, of gossip I am weary quite; Because I've no resource, thou'rt in the right. GARDEN MARGARET on FAUST'S arm. MARTHA with MEPHISTOPHELES walking up and down MARGARET I feel it, you but spare my ignorance, The gentleman to shame me stoops thus low. A traveller from complaisance, Still makes the best of things; I know Too well, my humble prattle never can Have power to entertain so wise a man. FAUST One glance, one word from thee doth charm me more, Than the world's wisdom or the sage's lore. (He kisses her hand.) MARGARET Nay! trouble not yourself! A hand so coarse, So rude as mine, how can you kiss! What constant work at home must I not do perforce! My mother too exacting is. (They pass on.) MARTHA Thus, sir, unceasing travel is your lot? MEPHISTOPHELES Traffic and duty urge us! With what pain Are we compelled to leave full many a spot, Where yet we dare not once remain! MARTHA In youth's wild years, with vigour crown'd, 'Tis not amiss thus through the world to sweep; But ah, the evil days come round! And to a lonely grave as bachelor to creep, A pleasant thing has no one found. MEPHISTOPHELES The prospect fills me with dismay. MARTHA Therefore in time, dear sir, reflect, I pray. (They pass on.) MARGARET Ay, out of sight is out of mind! Politeness easy is to you; Friends everywhere, and not a few, Wiser than I am, you will find. FAUST O dearest, trust me, what doth pass for sense Full oft is self-conceit and blindness! MARGARET How? FAUST Simplicity and holy innocence,-- When will ye learn your hallow'ed worth to know! Ah, when will meekness and humility, Kind and all-bounteous nature's loftiest dower-- MARGARET Only one little moment think of me! To think of you I shall have many an hour. FAUST You are perhaps much alone? MARGARET Yes, small our household is, I own, Yet must I see to it. No maid we keep, And I must cook, sew, knit, and Sweep, Still early on my feet and late; My mother is in all things, great and small, So accurate! Not that for thrift there is such pressing need; Than others we might make more show indeed; My father left behind a small estate, A house and garden near the city-wall. But fairly quiet now my days, I own; As soldier is my brother gone; My little sister's dead; the babe to rear Occasion'd me some care and fond annoy; But I would go through all again with joy, The darling was to me so dear. FAUST An angel, sweet, if it resembled thee! MARGARET I reared it up, and it grew fond of me. After my father's death it saw the day; We gave my mother up for lost, she lay In such a wretched plight, and then at length So very slowly she regain'd her strength. Weak as she was, 'twas vain for her to try Herself to suckle the poor babe, so I Reared it on milk and water all alone; And thus the child became as 'twere roy own; Within my arms it stretched itself and grew, And smiling, nestled in my bosom too. FAUST Doubtless the purest happiness was thine. MARGARET But many weary hours, in sooth, were also mine. At night its little cradle stood Close to my bed; so was I wide awake If it but stirred; One while I was obliged to give it food, Or to my arms the darling take; From bed full oft must rise, whene'er its cry I heard, And, dancing it, must pace the chamber to and fro; Stand at the wash-tub early; forthwith go To market, and then mind the cooking too-- To-morrow like to-day, the whole year through. Ah, sir, thus living, it must be confess'd One's spirits are not always of the best; Yet it a relish gives to food and rest. (They pass on.) MARTHA Poor women! we are badly off, I own; A bachelor's conversion's hard, indeed! MEPHISTOPHELES Madam, with one like you it rests alone, To tutor me a better course to lead. MARTHA Speak frankly, sir, none is there you have met? Has your heart ne'er attach'd itself as yet? MEPHISTOPHELES One's own fire-side and a good wife are gold And pearls of price, so says the proverb old. MARTHA I mean, has passion never stirred your breast? MEPHISTOPHELES I've everywhere been well received, I own. MARTHA Yet hath your heart no earnest preference known? MEPHISTOPHELES With ladies one should ne'er presume to jest. MARTHA Ah! you mistake! MEPHISTOPHELES I'm sorry I'm so blind! But this I know--that you are very kind. (They pass on.) FAUST Me, little angel, didst thou recognise, When in the garden first I came? MARGARET Did you not see it? I cast down my eyes. FAUST Thou dost forgive my boldness, dost not blame The liberty I took that day, When thou from church didst lately wend thy way? MARGARET I was confused. So had it never been; No one of me could any evil say. Alas, thought I, he doubtless in thy mien, Something unmaidenly or bold hath seen? It seemed as if it struck him suddenly, Here's just a girl with whom one may make free! Yet I must own that then I scarcely knew What in your favour here began at once to plead; Yet I was angry with myself indeed, That I more angry could not feel with you. FAUST Sweet love! MARGARET Just wait awhile! (She gathers a star-flower and plucks off the leaves one after another.) FAUST A nosegay may that be? MARGARET No! It is but a game. FAUST How? MARGARET Go, you'll laugh at me! (She plucks off the leaves and murmurs to herself.) FAUST What murmurest thou? MARGARET (half aloud)' He loves me--loves me not. FAUST Sweet angel, with thy face of heavenly bliss! MARGARET (continues) He loves me--not--he loves me--not-- (Plucking off the last leaf with fond joy.) He loves me! FAUST Yes! And this flower-language, darling, let it be, A heavenly oracle! He loveth thee! Know'st thou the meaning of, He loveth thee? (He seizes both her hands.) MARGARET I tremble so! FAUST Nay! Do not tremble, love! Let this hand-pressure, let this glance reveal Feelings, all power of speech above; To give oneself up wholly and to feel A joy that must eternal prove! Eternal!--Yes, its end would be despair. No end!--It cannot end! (MARGARET presses his hand, extricates herself, and runs away. He stands a moment in thought, and then follows her.) MARTHA (approaching) Night's closing. MEPHISTOPHELES Yes, we'll presently away. MARTHA I would entreat you longer yet to stay; But 'tis a wicked place, just here about; It is as if the folk had nothing else to do, Nothing to think of too, But gaping watch their neighbours, who goes in and out; And scandal's busy still, do whatsoe'er one may. And our young couple? MEPHISTOPHELES They have flown up there. The wanton butterflies! MARTHA He seems to take to her. MEPHISTOPHELES And she to him. 'Tis of the world the way! A SUMMER-HOUSE (MARGARET runs in, hides behind the door, holds the tip of her finger to her lip, and peeps through the crevice.) MARGARET He comes! FAUST Ah, little rogue, so thou Think'st to provoke me! I have caught thee now! (He kisses her.) MARGARET (embracing him, and returning the kiss) Dearest of men! I love thee from my heart! (MEPHISTOPHELES knocks.) Who's there? FAUST (stamping) MEPHISTOPHELES A friend! FAUST A brute! MEPHISTOPHELES MARTHA (comes) Ay, it is late, good sir. FAUST Mayn't I attend you, then? MARGARET Oh no--my mother would--adieu, adieu! FAUST And must I really then take leave of you? Farewell! MARTHA Good-bye! MARGARET Ere long to meet again! (Exeunt FAUST and MEPHISTOPHELES.) MARGARET Good heavens! how all things far and near Must fill his mind,--a man like this! Abash'd before him I appear, And say to all things only, yes. Poor simple child, I cannot see, What 'tis that he can find in me. (Exit.) FOREST AND CAVERN FAUST (alone) Spirit sublime! Thou gav'st me, gav'st me all For which I prayed! Not vainly hast thou turn'd To me thy countenance in flaming fire: Gayest me glorious nature for my realm, And also power to feel her and enjoy; Not merely with a cold and wondering glance, Thou dost permit me in her depths profound, As in the bosom of a friend to gaze. Before me thou dost lead her living tribes, And dost in silent grove, in air and stream Teach me to know my kindred. And when roars The howling storm-blast through the groaning wood, Wrenching the giant pine, which in its fall Crashing sweeps down its neighbour trunks and boughs, While hollow thunder from the hill resounds; Then thou dost lead me to some shelter'd cave, Dost there reveal me to myself, and show Of my own bosom the mysterious depths. And when with soothing beam, the moon's pale orb Full in my view climbs up the pathless sky, From crag and dewy grove, the silvery forms Of by-gone ages hover, and assuage The joy austere of contemplative thought. Oh, that naught perfect is assign'd to man, I feel, alas! With this exalted joy, Which lifts me near and nearer to the gods, Thou gav'st me this companion, unto whom I needs must cling, though cold and insolent, He still degrades me to myself, and turns Thy glorious gifts to nothing, with a breath. He in my bosom with malicious zeal For that fair image fans a raging fire; From craving to enjoyment thus I reel, And in enjoyment languish for desire. (MEPHISTOPHELES enters.) MEPHISTOPHELES Of this lone life have you not had your fill? How for so long can it have charms for you? 'Tis well enough to try it if you will; But then away again to something new! FAUST Would you could better occupy your leisure, Than in disturbing thus my hours of joy. MEPHISTOPHELES Well! Well! I'll leave you to yourself with pleasure, A serious tone you hardly dare employ. To part from one so crazy, harsh, and cross, Were not in truth a grievous loss. The live-long day, for you I toil and fret; Ne'er from his worship's face a hint I get, What pleases him, or what to let alone. FAUST Ay truly! that is just the proper tone! He wearies me, and would with thanks be paid MEPHISTOPHELES Poor Son of Earth, without my aid, How would thy weary days have flown? Thee of thy foolish whims I've cured, Thy vain imaginations banished, And but for me, be well assured, Thou from this sphere must soon have vanished. In rocky hollows and in caverns drear, Why like an owl sit moping here? Wherefore from dripping stones and moss with ooze embued, Dost suck, like any toad, thy food? A rare, sweet pastime. Verily! The doctor cleaveth still to thee. FAUST Dost comprehend what bliss without alloy From this wild wand'ring in the desert springs?-- Couldst thou but guess the new life-power it brings, Thou wouldst be fiend enough to envy me my joy. MEPHISTOPHELES What super-earthly ecstasy! at night, To lie in darkness on the dewy height, Embracing heaven and earth in rapture high, The soul dilating to a deity; With prescient yearnings pierce the core of earth, Feel in your labouring breast the six-days' birth, Enjoy, in proud delight what no one knows, While your love-rapture o'er creation flows,-- The earthly lost in beatific vision, And then the lofty intuition--. (With a gesture.) I need not tell you how--to close! FAUST Fie on you! MEPHISTOPHELES This displeases you? "For shame!" You are forsooth entitled to exclaim; We to chaste ears it seems must not pronounce What, nathless, the chaste heart cannot renounce. Well, to be brief, the joy as fit occasions rise, I grudge you not, of specious lies. But long this mood thou'lt not retain. Already thou'rt again outworn, And should this last, thou wilt be torn By frenzy or remorse and pain. Enough of this! Thy true love dwells apart, And all to her seems flat and tame; Alone thine image fills her heart, She loves thee with an all-devouring flame. First came thy passion with o'erpowering rush, Like mountain torrent, swollen by the melted snow; Pull in her heart didst pour the sudden gush, Now has thy brookiet ceased to flow. Instead of sitting throned midst forests wild, It would become so great a lord To comfort the enamour'd child, And the young monkey for her love reward. To her the hours seem miserably long; She from the window sees the clouds float by As o'er the lofty city-walls they fly, "If I a birdie were!" so runs her song, Half through the night and all day long. Cheerful sometimes, more oft at heart full sore; Fairly outwept seem now her tears, Anon she tranquil is, or so appears, And love-sick evermore. FAUST Snake! Serpent vile! MEPHISTOPHELES (aside) Good! If I catch thee with my guile! FAUST Vile reprobate! go get thee hence; Forbear the lovely girl to name! Nor in my half-distracted sense, Kindle anew the smouldering flame! MEPHISTOPHELES What wouldest thou! She thinks you've taken flight; It seems, she's partly in the right. FAUST I'm near her still--and should I distant rove, Her I can ne'er forget, ne'er lose her love; And all things touch'd by those sweet lips of hers, Even the very Host, my envy stirs. MEPHISTOPHELES 'Tis well! I oft have envied you indeed, The twin-pair that among the roses feed. FAUST Pander, avaunt! MEPHISTOPHELES Go to! I laugh, the while you rail, The power which fashion'd youth and maid, Well understood the noble trade; So neither shall occasion fail. But hence!--A mighty grief I trow! Unto thy lov'd one's chamber thou And not to death shouldst go. FAUST What is to me heaven's joy within her arms? What though my life her bosom warms!-- Do I not ever feel her woe? The outcast am I not, unhoused, unblest, Inhuman monster, without aim or rest, Who, like the greedy surge, from rock to rock, Sweeps down the dread abyss with desperate shock? While she, within her lowly cot, which graced The Alpine slope, beside the waters wild, Her homely cares in that small world embraced, Secluded lived, a simple, artless child. Was't not enough, in thy delirious whirl To blast the stedfast rocks; Her, and her peace as well, Must I, God-hated one, to ruin hurl! Dost claim this holocaust, remorseless Hell! Fiend, help me to cut short the hours of dread! Let what must happen, happen speedily! Her direful doom fall crushing on my head, And into ruin let her plunge with me! MEPHISTOPHELES Why how again it seethes and glows! Away, thou fool! Her torment ease! When such a head no issue sees, It pictures straight the final close. Long life to him who boldly dares! A devil's pluck thou'rt wont to show; As for a devil who despairs, Nothing I find so mawkish here below. MARGARET'S ROOM MARGARET (alone at her spinning wheel) My peace is gone, My heart is Sore, I find it never, And nevermore! Where him I have not, Is the grave; and all The world to me Is turned to gall. My wilder'd brain Is overwrought; My feeble senses Are distraught. My peace is gone, My heart is sore, I find it never, And nevermore! For him from the window I gaze, at home; For him and him only Abroad I roam. His lofty step, His bearing high, The smile of his lip, The power of his eye, His witching words, Their tones of bliss, His hand's fond pressure, And ah--his kiss! My peace is gone, My heart is sore, I find it never, And nevermore. My bosom aches To feel him near; Ah, could I clasp And fold him here! Kiss him and kiss him Again would I, And on his kisses I fain would die. MARTHA'S GARDEN MARGARET and FAUST MARGARET Promise me, Henry! FAUST What I can! MARGARET How thy religion fares, I fain would hear. Thou art a good kind-hearted man, Only that way not well-disposed, I fear. FAUST Forbear, my child! Thou feelest thee I love; My heart, my blood I'd give, my love to prove, And none would of their faith or church bereave. MARGARET That's not enough, we must ourselves believe! FAUST Must we? MARGARET Ah, could I but thy soul inspire! Thou honourest not the sacraments, alas! FAUST I honour them. MARGARET But yet without desire; 'Tis long since thou hast been either to shrift or mass. Dost thou believe in God? FAUST My darling, who dares say, Yes, I in God believe? Question or priest or sage, and they Seem, in the answer you receive, To mock the questioner. MARGARET Then thou dost not believe? FAUST Sweet one! my meaning do not misconceive! Him who dare name? And who proclaim, Him I believe? Who that can feel, His heart can steel, To say: I believe him not? The All-embracer, All-sustainer, Holds and sustains he not Thee, me, himself? Lifts not the Heaven its dome above? Doth not the firm-set earth beneath us lie? And beaming tenderly with looks of love, Climb not the everlasting stars on high? Do we not gaze into each other's eyes? Nature's impenetrable agencies, Are they not thronging on thy heart and brain, Viewless, or visible to mortal ken, Around thee weaving their mysterious chain? Fill thence thy heart, how large soe'er it be; And in the feeling when thou utterly art blest, Then call it, what thou wilt,-- Call it Bliss! Heart! Love! God! I have no name for it! 'Tis feeling all; Name is but sound and smoke Shrouding the glow of heaven. MARGARET All this is doubtless good and fair; Almost the same the parson says, Only in slightly different phrase. FAUST Beneath Heaven's sunshine, everywhere, This is the utterance of the human heart; Each in his language doth the like impart; Then why not I in mine? MARGARET What thus I hear Sounds plausible, yet I'm not reconciled; There's something wrong about it; much I fear That thou art not a Christian. FAUST My sweet child! MARGARET Alas! it long bath sorely troubled me, To see thee in such odious company. FAUST How so? MARGARET The man who comes with thee, I hate, Yea, in my spirit's inmost depths abhor; As his loath'd visage, in my life before, Naught to my heart e'er gave a pang so great. FAUST Him fear not, my sweet love! MARGARET His presence chills my blood. Towards all beside I have a kindly mood; Yet, though I yearn to gaze on thee, I feel At sight of him strange horror o'er me steal; That he's a villain my conviction's strong. May Heaven forgive me, if I do him wrong! FAUST Yet such strange fellows in the world must be! MARGARET I would not live with such an one as he. If for a moment he but enter here, He looks around him with a mocking sneer, And malice ill-conceal'd; That he with naught on earth can sympathize is clear; Upon his brow 'tis legibly revealed, That to his heart no living soul is dear. So blest I feel, within thine arms, So warm and happy,--free from all alarms; And still my heart doth close when he comes near. FAUST Foreboding angel! check thy fear! MARGARET It so o'ermasters me, that when, Or wheresoe'er, his step I hear, I almost think, no more I love thee then. Besides, when he is near, I ne'er could pray. This eats into my heart; with thee The same, my Henry, it must be. FAUST This is antipathy! MARGARET I must away. FAUST For one brief hour then may I never rest, And heart to heart, and soul to soul be pressed? MARGARET Ah, if I slept alone! To-night The bolt I fain would leave undrawn for thee; But then my mother's sleep is light, Were we surprised by her, ah me! Upon the spot I should be dead. FAUST Dear angel! there's no cause for dread. Here is a little phial,--if she take Mixed in her drink three drops, 'twill steep Her nature in a deep and soothing sleep. MARGARET What Do I not for thy dear sake! To her it will not harmful prove? FAUST Should I advise it else, sweet love? MARGARET I know not, dearest, when thy face I see, What doth my spirit to thy will constrain; Already I have done so much for thee, That scarcely more to do doth now remain. (Exit,) MEPHISTOPHELES (enters) MEPHISTOPHELES The monkey! Is she gone? FAUST Again hast played the spy? MEPHISTOPHELES Of all that pass'd I'm well apprized, I heard the doctor catechised, And trust he'll profit much thereby! Fain would the girls inquire indeed Touching their lover's faith and creed, And whether pious in the good old way; They think, if pliant there, us too he will obey. FAUST Thou monster, does not see that this Pure soul, possessed by ardent love, Full of the living faith, To her of bliss The only pledge, must holy anguish prove, Holding the man she loves, Fore-doomed to endless death! MEPHISTOPHELES Most sensual, supersensualist? The while A damsel leads thee by the nose! FAUST Of filth and fire abortion vile! MEPHISTOPHELES In physiognomy strange skill she shows; She in my presence feels she knows not how; My mask it seems a hidden sense reveals; That I'm a genius she must needs allow, That I'm the very devil perhaps she feels. So then to-night-- FAUST What's that to you? MEPHISTOPHELES I've my amusement in it too! AT THE WELL MARGARET and BESSY, with pitchers BESSY Of Barbara hast nothing heard? MARGARET I rarely go from home,--no, not a word BESSY 'Tis true: Sybilla told me so to-day! That comes of being proud, methinks; She played the fool at last, MARGARET How so? BESSY They say That two she feedeth when she eats and drinks. MARGARET Alas! BESSY She's rightly served, in sooth, How long she hung upon the youth! What promenades, what jaunts there were, To dancing booth and village fair! The first she everywhere must shine, He always treating her to pastry and to wine. Of her good looks she was so vain, So shameless too, that to retain His presents, she did not disdain; Sweet words and kisses came anon-- And then the virgin flower was gone. MARGARET Poor thing! BESSY Forsooth dost pity her? At night, when at our wheels we sat, Abroad our mothers ne'er would let us stir. Then with her lover she must chat, Or on the bench or in the dusky walk, Thinking the hours too brief for their Sweet talk; Her proud head she will have to bow, And in white sheet do penance now! MARGARET But he will surely marry her? BESSY Not he! He won't be such a fool! a gallant lad Like him, can roam o'er land and sea, Besides, he's off. MARGARET That is not fair! BESSY If she should get him, 'twere almost as bad! Her myrtle wreath the boys would tear; And then we girls would plague her too, For we chopp'd straw before her door would strew! (Exit.) MARGARET (walking towards home) How stoutly once I could inveigh, If a poor maiden went astray; Not words enough my tongue could find, 'Gainst others' sin to speak my mind! Black as it seemed, I blacken'd it still more, And strove to make it blacker than before. And did myself securely bless-- Now my own trespass doth appear! Yet ah!--what urg'd me to transgress, God knows, it was so sweet, so dear! ZWINGER Enclosure between the City-wall and the Gate. (In the niche of the wall a devotional image of the Mater dolorosa, with flower-pots before it.) MARGARET (putting fresh flowers in the pots) Ah, rich in sorrow, thou, Stoop thy maternal brow, And mark with pitying eye my misery! The sword in thy pierced heart, Thou dost with bitter smart, Gaze upwards on thy Son's death agony. To the dear God on high, Ascends thy piteous sigh, Pleading for his and thy sore misery. Ah, who can know The torturing woe, The pangs that rack me to the bone? How my poor heart, without relief, Trembles and throbs, its yearning grief Thou knowest, thou alone! Ah, wheresoe'er I go, With woe, with woe, with woe, My anguish'd breast is aching! When all alone I creep, I weep, I weep, I weep, Alas! my heart is breaking! The flower-pots at my window Were wet with tears of mine, The while I pluck'd these blossoms, At dawn to deck thy shrine! When early in my chamber Shone bright the rising morn, I sat there on my pallet, My heart with anguish torn. Help! from disgrace and death deliver me! Ah! rich in sorrow, thou, Stoop thy maternal brow, And mark with pitying eye my misery! NIGHT. STREET BEFORE MARGARET'S DOOR VALENTINE (a soldier, MARGARET'S brother) When seated 'mong the jovial crowd, Where merry comrades boasting loud Each named with pride his favourite lass, And in her honour drain'd his glass; Upon my elbows I would lean, With easy quiet view the scene, Nor give my tongue the rein until Each swaggering blade had talked his fill. Then smiling I my beard would stroke, The while, with brimming glass, I spoke; "Each to his taste!--but to my mind, Where in the country will you find, A maid, as my dear Gretchen fair, Who with my sister can compare?" Cling! Clang! so rang the jovial sound! Shouts of assent went circling round; Pride of her sex is she!--cried some; Then were the noisy boasters dumb. And now I--I could tear out my hair, Or dash my brains out in despair!-- Me every scurvy knave may twit, With stinging jest and taunting sneer! Like skulking debtor I must sit, And sweat each casual word to hear! And though I smash'd them one and all,-- Yet them I could not liars call. Who comes this way? who's sneaking here? If I mistake not, two draw near. If he be one, have at him;--well I wot Alive he shall not leave this spot! FAUST. MEPHISTOPHELES FAUST How from yon sacristy, athwart the night, Its beams the ever-burning taper throws, While ever waning, fades the glimmering light, As gathering darkness doth around it close! So night-like gloom doth in my bosom reign. MEPHISTOPHELES I'm like a tom-cat in a thievish vein, That up fire-ladders tall and steep, And round the walls doth slyly creep; Virtuous withal, I feel, with, I confess, A touch of thievish joy and wantonness. Thus through my limbs already burns The glorious Walpurgis night! After to-morrow it returns, Then why one wakes, one knows aright! FAUST Meanwhile, the treasure I see glimmering there, Will it ascend into the open air? MEPHISTOPHELES Ere long thou wilt proceed with pleasure, To raise the casket with its treasure; I took a peep, therein are stored, Of lion-dollars a rich hoard. FAUST And not a trinket? not a ring? Wherewith my lovely girl to deck? MEPHISTOPHELES I saw among them some such thing, A string of pearls to grace her neck. FAUST 'Tis well! I'm always loath to go, Without some gift my love to show. MEPHISTOPHELES Some pleasures gratis to enjoy, Should surely cause you no annoy. While bright with stars the heavens appear, I'll sing a masterpiece of art: A moral song shall charm her ear, More surely to beguile her heart. (Sings to the guitar.)' Kathrina say, Why lingering stay At dawn of day Before your lover's door? Maiden, beware, Nor enter there, Lest forth you fare, A maiden never more. Maiden take heed! Reck well my rede! Is't done, the deed? Good night, you poor, poor thing! The spoiler's lies, His arts despise, Nor yield your prize, Without the marriage ring! VALENTINE (steps forward) Whom are you luring here? I'll give it you! Accursed rat-catchers, your strains I'll end! First, to the devil the guitar I'll send! Then to the devil with the singer too! MEPHISTOPHELES The poor guitar! 'tis done for now. VALENTINE Your skull shall follow next, I trow! MEPHISTOPHELES (to FAUST) Doctor, stand fast! your strength collect! Be prompt, and do as I direct. Out with your whisk, keep close, I pray, I'll parry I do you thrust away! VALENTINE Then parry that! MEPHISTOPHELES Why not? VALENTINE That too! MEPHISTOPHELES With ease! VALENTINE The devil fights for you! Why how is this? my hand's already lamed! MEPHISTOPHELES (to FAUST) Thrust home! VALENTINE (falls) Alas! MEPHISTOPHELES There! Now the lubber's tamed! But quick, away! We must at once take wing; A cry of murder strikes upon the ear; With the police I know my course to steer, But with the blood-ban 'tis another thing. MARTHA (at the window) Without! without! MARGARET (at the window) Quick, bring a light! MARTHA (as above) They rail and scuffle, scream and fight! PEOPLE One lieth here already dead! MARTHA (coming out) Where are the murderers? are they fled? MARGARET (coming out) Who lieth here? PEOPLE Thy mother's son. MARGARET Almighty God! I am undone! VALENTINE I'm dying--'tis a soon-told tale, And sooner done the deed. Why, women, do ye howl and wail? To my last words give heed! (All gather round him.) My Gretchen, see! still young art thou, Art not discreet enough, I trow, Thou dost thy matters ill; Let this in confidence be said: Since thou the path of shame dost tread, Tread it with right good will! MARGARET My brother! God! what can this mean? VALENTINE Abstain, Nor dare God's holy name profane! What's done, alas, is done and past! Matters will take their course at last; By stealth thou dost begin with one, Others will follow him anon; And when a dozen thee have known, Thou'lt common be to all the town. When infamy is newly born, In secret she is brought to light, And the mysterious veil of night O'er head and ears is drawn; The loathsome birth men fain would slay; But soon, full grown, she waxes bold, And though not fairer to behold, With brazen front insults the day: The more abhorrent to the sight, The more she courts the day's pure light. The time already I discern, When thee all honest folk will spurn, And shun thy hated form to meet, As when a corpse infects the street. Thy heart will sink in blank despair, When they shall look thee in the face! A golden chain no more thou'lt wear! Nor near the altar take in church thy place! In fair lace collar simply dight Thou'lt dance no more with spirits light! In darksome corners thou wilt bide, Where beggars vile and cripples hide, And e'en though God thy crime forgive, On earth, a thing accursed, thou'lt live! MARTHA Your parting soul to God commend! Your dying breath in slander will you spend? VALENTINE Could I but reach thy wither'd frame, Thou wretched beldame, void of shame! Full measure I might hope to win Of pardon then for every sin. MARGARET VALENTINE I tell thee, from vain tears abstain! 'Twas thy dishonour pierced my heart, Thy fall the fatal death-stab gave. Through the death-sleep I now depart To God, a soldier true and brave. (dies.) CATHEDRAL Service, Organ, and Anthem MARGARET amongst a number of people EVIL-SPIRIT behind MARGARET EVIL-SPIRIT How different, Gretchen, was it once with thee, When thou, still full of innocence, Here to the altar camest, And from the small and well-conn'd book Didst lisp thy prayer, Half childish sport, Half God in thy young heart! Gretchen! What thoughts are thine? What deed of shame Lurks in thy sinful heart? Is thy prayer utter'd for thy mother's soul, Who into long, long torment slept through thee? Whose blood is on thy threshold? --And stirs there not already 'neath thy heart Another quick'ning pulse, that even now Tortures itself and thee With its foreboding presence? MARGARET Woe! Woe! Oh could I free me from the thoughts That hither, thither, crowd upon my brain, Against my will! CHORUS Dies irae, dies illa, Solvet saeclum in favilla. (The organ sounds.) EVIL-SPIRIT Grim horror seizes thee! The trumpet sounds! The graves are shaken! And thy heart From ashy rest For torturing flames Anew created, Trembles into life! MARGARET Would I were hence! It is as if the organ Choked my breath, As if the choir Melted my inmost heart! CHORUS Judex ergo cum sedebit, Quidquid latet adparebit! Nil inultunt remanebit. MARGARET I feel oppressed! The pillars of the wall Imprison me! The vaulted roof Weighs down upon me I--air! EVIL-SPIRIT Wouldst hide thee? sin and shame Remain not hidden! Air! light! Woe's thee! CHORUS Quid sum miser tunc dicturus? Quem patronum rogaturus! Cum vix justus sit securus. EVIL-SPIRIT The glorified their faces turn Away from thee! Shudder the pure to reach Their hands to thee! Woe! CHORUS Quid sum miser tunc dicturus-- MARGARET Neighbour! your smelling bottle! (She swoons away.) WALPURGIS-NIGHT THE HARTZ MOUNTAINS. DISTRICT OF SCHIERKE AND ELEND FAUST and MEPHISTOPHELES MEPHISTOPHELES A broomstick dost thou not at least desire? The roughest he-goat fain would I bestride, By this road from our goal we're still far wide. FAUST While fresh upon my legs, so long I naught require, Except this knotty staff. Beside, What boots it to abridge a pleasant way? Along the labyrinth of these vales to creep, Then scale these rocks, whence, in eternal spray, Adown the cliffs the silvery fountains leap: Such is the joy that seasons paths like these! Spring weaves already in the birchen trees; E'en the late pine-grove feels her quickening powers; Should she not work within these limbs of ours? MEPHISTOPHELES Naught of this genial influence do I know! Within me all is wintry. Frost and snow I should prefer my dismal path to bound. How sadly, yonder, with belated glow Rises the ruddy moon's imperfect round, Shedding so faint a light, at every tread One's sure to stumble 'gainst a rock or tree! An Ignis Fatuus I must call instead. Yonder one burning merrily, I see. Holla! my friend! may I request your light? Why should you flare away so uselessly? Be kind enough to show us up the height! IGNIS FATUUS Through reverence, I hope I may subdue The lightness of my nature; true, Our course is but a zigzag one. MEPHISTOPHELES Ho! ho! So men, forsooth, he thinks to imitate! Now, in the devil's name, for once go straight! Or out at once your flickering life I'll blow. IGNIS FAPUUS That you are master here it obvious quite; To do your will, I'll cordially essay; Only reflect! The hill is magic-mad to-night; And if to show the path you choose a meteor's light, You must not wonder should we go astray. FAUST, MEPHISTOPHELES, IGNIS FATUUS (in alternate song) Through the dream and magic-sphere As it seems, we now are speeding; Honour win, us rightly leading, That betimes we may appear In yon wide and desert region! Trees on trees, a stalwart legion, Swiftly past us are retreating, And the cliffs with lowly greeting; Rocks long-snouted, row on row, How they snort, and how they blow! Through the stones and heather springing, Brook and brooklet haste below; Hark the rustling! Hark the singing! Hearken to love's plaintive lays; Voices of those heavenly days-- What we hope, and what we love! Like a tale of olden time, Echo's voice prolongs the chime. To-whit! To-whoo! It sounds more near; Plover, owl, and jay appear, All awake, around, above? Paunchy salamanders too Peer, long-limbed, the bushes through! And, like snakes, the roots of trees Coil themselves from rock and sand, Stretching many a wondrous band, Us to frighten, us to seize; From rude knots with life embued, Polyp-fangs abroad they spread, To snare the wanderer! 'Neath our tread, Mice, in myriads, thousand-hued, Through the heath and through the moss! And the fire-flies' glittering throng, Wildering escort, whirls along, Here and there, our path across. Tell me, stand we motionless, Or still forward do we press? All things round us whirl and fly; Rocks and trees make strange grimaces, Dazzling meteors change their places, How they puff and multiply! MEPHISTOPHELES Now grasp my doublet--we at last A central peak have reached, which shows, If round a wondering glance we cast, How in the mountain Mammon glows. FAUST How through the chasms strangely gleams, A lurid light, like dawn's red glow, Pervading with its quivering beams, The gorges of the gulf below! Here vapours rise, there clouds float by, Here through the mist the light doth shine; Now, like a fount, it bursts on high, Meanders now, a slender line; Far reaching, with a hundred veins, Here through the valley see it glide; Here, where its force the gorge restrains, At once it scatters, far and wide; Anear, like showers of golden sand Strewn broadcast, sputter sparks of light: And mark yon rocky walls that stand Ablaze, in all their towering height! MEPHISTOPHELES Doth not Sir Mammon for this fete Grandly illume his palace! Thou Art lucky to have seen it; now, The boisterous guests, I feel, are coming straight. FAUST How through the air the storm doth whirl! Upon my neck it strikes with sudden shock. MEPHISTOPHELES Cling to these ancient ribs of granite rock, Else to yon depths profound it you will hurl. A murky vapour thickens night. Hark! Through the woods the tempests roar! The owlets flit in wild affright. Hark! Splinter'd are the columns that upbore The leafy palace, green for aye: The shivered branches whirr and sigh, Yawn the huge trunks with mighty groan. The roots upriven, creak and moan! In fearful and entangled fall, One crashing ruin whelms them all, While through the desolate abyss, Sweeping the, wreck-strewn precipice, The raging storm-blasts howl and hiss! Aloft strange voices dost thou hear? Distant now and now more near? Hark! the mountain ridge along, Streameth a raving magic-song! WITCHES (in chorus) Now to the Brocken the witches hie, The stubble is yellow, the corn is green; Thither the gathering legions fly, And sitting aloft is Sir Urial seen: O'er stick and o'er stone they go whirling along, Witches and he-goats, a motley throng. VOICES Alone old Baubo's coming now; She rides upon a farrow sow. CHORUS Honour to her, to whom honour is due! Forward, Dame Baubo! Honour to you! A goodly sow and mother thereon, The whole witch chorus follows anon. VOICE Which way didst come? VOICE O'er Ilsenstein! There I peep'd in an owlet's nest. With her broad eye she gazed in mine! VOICE Drive to the devil, thou hellish pest! Why ride so hard? VOICE She has graz'd my side, Look at the wounds, how deep and how wide! WITCHES (in chorus) The way is broad, the way is long; What mad pursuit! What tumult wild! Scratches the besom and sticks the prong; Crush'd is the mother, and stifled the child. WIZARDS (half chorus) Like house-encumber'd Snail we creep; While far ahead the women keep, For when to the devil's house we speed, By a thousand steps they take the lead. THE OTHER HALF Not so, precisely do we view it;---- They with a thousand steps may do it; But let them hasten as they can, With one long bound 'tis clear'd by man. VOICES (above) Come with us, come with us from Felsensee. VOICES (from below) Aloft to you we would mount with glee! We wash, and free from all stain are we, Yet barren evermore must be! BOTH CHORUSES The wind is hushed, the stars grow pale, The pensive moon her light doth veil; And whirling on, the magic choir Sputters forth sparks of drizzling fire. VOICE (from below) Stay! stay! VOICE (from above) What voice of woe Calls from the cavern'd depths below? VOICE (from below) Take me with you! Oh take me too! Three centuries I climb in vain, And yet can ne'er the summit gain! To be with my kindred I am fain. BOTH CHORUSES Broom and pitch-fork, goat and prong, Mounted on these we whirl along; Who vainly strives to climb to-night, Is evermore a luckless wight! DEMI-WITCH (below) I hobble after, many a day; Already the others are far away! No rest at home can I obtain-- Here too my efforts are in vain! CHORUS OF WITCHES Salve gives the witches strength to rise; A rag for a sail does well enough; A goodly ship is every trough; To-night who flies not, never flies. BOTH CHORUSES And when the topmost peak we round, Then alight ye on the ground; The heath's wide regions cover ye With your mad swarms of witchery! (They let themselves down.) MEPHISTOPHELES They crowd and jostle, whirl and flutter! They whisper, babble, twirl, and splutter! They glimmer, sparkle, stink and flare-- A true witch-element! Beware! Stick close! else we shall severed be. Where art thou? FAUST (in the distance) Here! MEPHISTOPHELES Already, whirl'd so far away! The master then indeed I needs must play. Give ground! Squire Voland comes! Sweet folk, give ground! Here, doctor, grasp me! With a single bound Let us escape this ceaseless jar; Even for me too mad these people are. Hard by there shineth something with peculiar glare, Yon brake allureth me; it is not far; Come, come along with me! we'll slip in there. FAUST Spirit of contradiction! Lead! I'll follow straight! 'Twas wisely done, however, to repair On May-night to the Brocken, and when there By our own choice ourselves to isolate! MEPHISTOPHELES Murk, of those flames the motley glare! A merry club assembles there. In a small circle one is not alone, FAUST I'd rather be above, though, I must own! Already fire and eddying smoke I view; The impetuous millions to the devil ride; Full many a riddle will be there untied. MEPHISTOPHELES Ay! and full many a riddle tied anew. But let the great world rave and riot! Here will we house ourselves in quiet. A custom 'tis of ancient date, Our lesser worlds within the great world to create! Young witches there I see, naked and bare, And old ones, veil'd more prudently. For my sake only courteous be! The trouble's small, the sport is rare. Of instruments I hear the cursed din-- One must get used to it. Come in! come in! There's now no help for it. I'll step before And introducing you as my good friend, Confer on you one obligation more. How say you now? 'Tis no such paltry room Why only look, you scarce can see the end. A hundred fires in rows disperse the gloom; They dance, they talk, they cook, make love, and drink: Where could we find aught better, do you think? FAUST To introduce us, do you purpose here As devil or as wizard to appear? MEPHISTOPHELES Though I am wont indeed to strict incognito, Yet upon gala-days one must one's orders show. No garter have I to distinguish me, Nathless the cloven foot doth here give dignity. Seest thou yonder snail? Crawling this way she hies: With searching feelers, she, no doubt, Hath me already scented out; Here, even if I would, for me there's no disguise. From fire to fire, we'll saunter at our leisure, The gallant you, I'll cater for your pleasure. (To a party seated round some expiring embers.) Old gentleman, apart, why sit ye moping here? Ye in the midst should be of all this jovial cheer, Girt round with noise and youthful riot; At home one surely has enough of quiet. GENERAL In nations put his trust, who may, Whate'er for them one may have done; For with the people, as with women, they Honour your rising stars alone! MINISTER Now all too far they wander from the right; I praise the good old ways, to them I hold, Then was the genuine age of gold, When we ourselves were foremost in men's sight. PARVENU Ne'er were we 'mong your dullards found, And what we ought not, that to do were fair; Yet now are all things turning round and round, When on firm basis we would them maintain. AUTHOR Who, as a rule, a treatise now would care To read, of even moderate sense? As for the rising generation, ne'er Has youth displayed such arrogant pretence. MEPHISTOPHELES (suddenly appearing very old) Since for the last time I the Brocken scale, That folk are ripe for doomsday, now one sees; And just because my cask begins to fail, So the whole world is also on the lees. HUCKSTER-WITCH Stop, gentlemen, nor pass me by, Of wares I have a choice collection: Pray honour them with your inspection. Lose not this opportunity Yet nothing in my booth you'll find Without its counterpart on earth; there's naught, Which to the world, and to mankind, Hath not some direful mischief wrought. No dagger here, which bath not flow'd with blood, No chalice, whence, into some healthy frame Hath not been poured hot poison's wasting flood. No trinket, but bath wrought some woman's shame, No weapon but bath cut some sacred tie, Or from behind bath stabb'd an enemy. MEPHISTOPHELES Gossip! For wares like these the time's gone by, What's done is past! what's past is done! With novelties your booth supply; Us novelties attract alone. FAUST May this wild scene my senses spare! This, may in truth be called a fair! MEPHISTOPHELES Upward the eddying concourse throng; Thinking to push, thyself art push'd along. FAUST Who's that, pray? MEPHISTOPHELES Mark her well! That's Lilith. FAUST Who? MEPHISTOPHELES Adam's first wife. Of her rich locks beware! That charm in which she's parallel'd by few; When in its toils a youth she doth ensnare, He will not soon escape, I promise you. FAUST There sit a pair, the old one with the young; Already they have bravely danced and sprung! MEPHISTOPHELES Here there is no repose to-day. Another dance begins; we'll join it, come away! FAUST (dancing with the young one) Once a fair vision came to me; Therein I saw an apple-tree, Two beauteous apples charmed mine eyes; I climb'd forthwith to reach the prize. THE FAIR ONE. Apples still fondly ye desire, From paradise it bath been so. Feelings of joy my breast inspire That such too in my garden grow. MEPHISTOPHELES (with the old one) Once a weird vision came to me; Therein I saw a rifted tree. I had a . . . . .have ready here, But as it was it pleased me too. THE OLD ONE I beg most humbly to salute The gallant with the cloven foot! Let him a . . . have ready here, If he a . . . does not fear. PROCTOPHANTASMIST Accursed mob! How dare ye thus to meet? Have I not shown and demonstrated too, That ghosts stand not on ordinary feet? Yet here ye dance, as other mortals do! THE FAIR ONE (dancing) Then at our ball, what doth he here? FAUST (dancing) Oh! He must everywhere appear. He must adjudge, when others dance; If on each step his say's not said, So is that step as good as never made. He's most annoyed, so soon as we advance; If ye would circle in one narrow round, As he in his old mill, then doubtless he Your dancing would approve,--especially If ye forthwith salute him with respect profound! PROCTOPHANTASMIST Still here! what arrogance! unheard of quite! Vanish; we now have fill'd the world with light! Laws are unheeded by the devil's host; Wise as we are, yet Tegel hath its ghost! How long at this conceit I've swept with all my might, Lost is the labour: 'tis unheard of quite! THE FAIR ONE Cease here to teaze us any more, I pray. PROCTOPHANTASMIST Spirits, I plainly to your face declare: No spiritual control myself will bear, Since my own spirit can exert no sway. (The dancing continues.) To-night, I see, I shall in naught succeed; But I'm prepar'd my travels to pursue, And hope, before my final step indeed, To triumph over bards and devils too. MEPHISTOPHELES Now in some puddle will he take his station, Such is his mode of seeking consolation; Where leeches, feasting on his rump, will drain Spirits alike and spirit from his brain. (To FAUST, who has left the dance.) But why the charming damsel leave, I pray, Who to you in the dance so sweetly sang? FAUST Ah, in the very middle of her lay, Out of her mouth a small red mouse there sprang. MEPHISTOPHELES Suppose there did! One must not be too nice. 'Twas well it was not grey, let that suffice. Who 'mid his pleasures for a trifle cares? FAUST Then saw I-- MEPHISTOPHELES What? FAUST Mephisto, seest thou there Standing far off, a lone child, pale and fair? Slow from the spot her drooping form she tears, And seems with shackled feet to move along; I own, within me the delusion's strong, That she the likeness of my Gretchen wears. MEPHISTOPHELES Gaze not upon her! 'Tis not good! Forbear! 'Tis lifeless, magical, a shape of air, An idol. Such to meet with, bodes no good; That rigid look of hers doth freeze man's blood, And well-nigh petrifies his heart to stone:-- The story of Medusa thou hast known. FAUST Ay, verily! a corpse's eyes are those, Which there was no fond loving hand to close. That is the bosom I so fondly press'd, That my sweet Gretchen's form, so oft caress'd! MEPHISTOPHELES Deluded fool! 'Tis magic, I declare! To each she doth his lov'd one's image wear. FAUST What bliss! what torture! vainly I essay To turn me from that piteous look away. How strangely doth a single crimson line Around that lovely neck its coil entwine, It shows no broader than a knife's blunt edge! MEPHISTOPHELES Quite right. I see it also, and allege That she beneath her arm her head can bear, Since Perseus cut it off.--But you I swear Are craving for illusion still! Come then, ascend yon little hill! As on the Prater all is gay, And if my senses are not gone, I see a theatre,--what's going on? SERVIRILIS They are about to recommence;--the play Will be the last of seven, and spick-span new--' 'Tis usual here that number to present. A dilettante did the piece invent, And dilettanti will enact it too. Excuse me, gentlemen; to me's assign'd As dilettante to uplift the curtain. MEPHISTOPHELES You on the Blocksberg I'm rejoiced to find, That 'tis your most appropriate sphere is certain. WALPURGIS-NIGHT'S DREAM OR OBERON AND TITANIA'S GOLDEN WEDDING-FEAST Intermezzo THEATRE MANAGER Vales, where mists still shift and play, To ancient hills succeeding,-- These our scenes;--so we, to-day, May rest, brave sons of Mieding. HERALD That the marriage golden be, Must fifty years be ended; More dear this feast of gold to me, Contention now suspended. OBERON Spirits, if present, grace the scene, And if with me united, Then gratulate the king and queen, Their troth thus newly plighted! PUCK Puck draws near and wheels about, In mazy circles dancing! Hundreds swell his joyous shout, Behind him still advancing. ARIEL Ariel wakes his dainty air, His lyre celestial stringing.-- Fools he lureth, and the fair, With his celestial singing. OBERON Wedded ones, would ye agree, We court your imitation: Would ye fondly love as we, We counsel separation. TITANIA If husband scold and wife retort, Then bear them far asunder; Her to the burning south transport, And him the North Pole under. THE WHOLE ORCHESTRA (fortissimo) Flies and midges all unite With frog and chirping cricket, Our orchestra throughout the night, Resounding in the thicket! (Solo) Yonder doth the bagpipe come! Its sack an airy bubble. Schnick, schnick, schnack, with nasal hum, Its notes it doth redouble. EMBRYO SPIRIT Spider's foot and midge's wing, A toad in form and feature; Together verses it can string, Though scarce n living creature. A LITTLE PAIR Tiny step and lofty bound, Through dew and exhalation; Ye trip it deftly on the ground, But gain no elevation. INQUISITIVE TRAVELLER Can I indeed believe my eyes? Is't not mere masquerading? What! Oberon in beauteous step Among the groups parading! ORTHODOX No claws, no tail to whisk about, To fright us at our revel;-- Yet like the gods of Greece, no doubt, He too's a genuine devil. NORTHERN ARTIST These that I'm hitting off to-day Are sketches unpretending; Towards Italy without delay, My steps I think of bending. PURIST Alas! ill-fortune leads me here, Where riot still grows louder; And 'mong the witches gather'd here But two alone wear powder! YOUNG WITCH Your powder and your petticoat, Suit hags, there's no gainsaying; Hence I sit fearless on my goat, My naked charms displaying. MATRON We're too well-bred to squabble here, Or insult back to render; But may you wither soon, my dear, Although so young and tender. LEADER OF THE BAND Nose of fly and gnat's proboscis, Throng not the naked beauty! Frogs and crickets in the mosses, Keep time and do your duty! WEATHERCOCK (towards one side) What charming company I view Together here collected! Gay bachelors, a hopeful crew. And brides so unaffected! WEATHERCOCK (towards the other side) Unless indeed the yawning ground Should open to receive them, From this vile crew, with sudden bound, To Hell I'd jump and leave them. XENIEN With small sharp shears, in insect guise Behold us at your revel! That we may tender, filial-wise, Our homage to the devil. HENNINGS Look now at yonder eager crew, How naively they're jesting! That they have tender hearts and true, They stoutly keep protesting! MUSAGET Oneself amid this witchery How pleasantly one loses; For witches easier are to me To govern than the Muses! CI-DEVANT GENIUS OF THE AGE With proper folks when we appear, No one can then surpass us! Keep close, wide is the Blocksberg here As Germany's Parnassus. INQUISITIVE TRAVELLER How name ye that stiff formal man, Who strides with lofty paces? He tracks the game where'er he can, "He scents the Jesuits' traces." CRANE Where waters troubled are or clear, To fish I am delighted; Thus pious gentlemen appear With devils here united. WORLDLING By pious people, it is true, No medium is rejected; Conventicles, and not a few, On Blocksberg are erected. DANCER Another chorus now succeeds, Far off the drums are beating. Be still! The bitterns 'mong the reeds Their one note are repeating. DANCING MASTER Each twirls about and never stops, And as he can he fareth. The crooked leaps, the clumsy hops, Nor for appearance careth. FIDDLER To take each other's life, I trow, Would cordially delight them! As Orpheus' lyre the beasts, so now The bagpipe doth unite them. DOGMATIST My views, in spite of doubt and sneer, I hold with stout persistence, Inferring from the devils here, The evil one's existence. IDEALIST My every sense rules Phantasy With sway quite too potential; Sure I'm demented if the I Alone is the essential. REALIST This entity's a dreadful bore, And cannot choose but vex me; The ground beneath me ne'er before Thus totter'd to perplex me. SUPERNATURALIST Well pleased assembled here I view Of spirits this profusion; From devils, touching angels too, I gather some conclusion. SCEPTIC The ignis fatuus they track out, And think they're near the treasure, Devil alliterates with doubt, Here I abide with pleasure. LEADER OF THE BAND Frog and cricket in the mosses,-- Confound your gasconading! Nose of fly and gnat's proboscis;-- Most tuneful serenading! THE KNOWING ONES Sans-souci, so this host we greet, Their jovial humour showing; There's now no walking on our feet, So on our heads we're going. THE AWKWARD ONES In seasons past we snatch'd, 'tis true, Some tit-bits by our cunning; Our shoes, alas, are now danced through, On our bare soles we're running. WILL-O'-THE-WISPS From marshy bogs we sprang to light, Yet here behold us dancing; The gayest gallants of the night, In glitt'ring rows advancing. SHOOTING STAR With rapid motion from on high, I shot in starry splendour; Now prostrate on the grass I lie;-- Who aid will kindly render? THE MASSIVE ONES Room! wheel round! They're coming lo! Down sink the bending grasses. Though spirits, yet their limbs, we know, Are huge substantial masses. PUCK Don't stamp so heavily, I pray; Like elephants you're treading! And 'mong the elves be Puck to-day, The stoutest at the wedding! ARIEL If nature boon, or subtle sprite, Endow your soul with pinions;-- Then follow to yon rosy height, Through ether's calm dominions! ORCHESTRA (pianissimo) Drifting cloud and misty wreathes Are fill'd with light elysian; O'er reed and leaf the zephyr breathes-- So fades the fairy vision! A GLOOMY DAY. A PLAIN FAUST and MEPHISTOPHELES FAUST In misery! despairing! long wandering pitifully on the face of the earth and now imprisoned! This gentle hapless creature, immured in the dungeon as a malefactor and reserved for horrid tortures! That it should come to this! To this!--Perfidious, worthless spirit, and this thou hast concealed from me!--Stand! ay, stand! roll in malicious rage thy fiendish eyes! Stand and brave me with thine insupportable presence! Imprisoned! In hopeless misery! Delivered over to the power of evil spirits and the judgment of unpitying humanity I--And me, the while, thou wert lulling with tasteless dissipations, concealing from me her growing anguish, and leaving her to perish without help! MEPHISTOPHELES She is not the first. FAUST Hound! Execrable monster!--Back with him, oh thou infinite spirit! back with the reptile into his dog's shape, in which it was his wont to scamper before me at eventide, to roll before the feet of the harmless wanderer, and to fasten on his shoulders when he fell! Change him again into his favourite shape, that he may crouch on his belly before me in the dust, whilst I spurn him with my foot, the reprobate!--Not the first!--Woe! Woe! By no human soul is it conceivable, that more than one human creature has ever sunk into a depth of wretchedness like this, or that the first in her writhing death-agony should not have atoned in the sight of all-pardoning Heaven for the guilt of all the rest! The misery of this one pierces me to the very marrow, and harrows up my soul; thou art grinning calmly over the doom of thousands! MEPHISTOPHELES Now we are once again at our wit's end, just where the reason of you mortals snaps! Why dost thou seek our fellowship, if thou canst not go through with it? Wilt fly, and art not proof against dizziness? Did we force ourselves on thee, or thou on us? FAUST Cease thus to gnash thy ravenous fangs at me! I loathe thee!--Great and glorious spirit, thou who didst vouchsafe to reveal thyself unto me, thou who dost know my very heart and soul, why hast thou linked me with this base associate, who feeds on mischief and revels in destruction? MEPHISTOPHELES Hast done? FAUST Save her!--or woe to thee! The direst of curses on thee for thousands of years! MEPHISTOPHELES I cannot loose the bands of the avenger, nor withdraw his bolts.--Save her!--Who was it plunged her into perdition? I or thou? (FAUST looks wildly around.) MEPHISTOPHELES Would'st grasp the thunder? Well for you, poor mortals, that 'tis not yours to wield! To smite to atoms the being however innocent, who obstructs his path, such is the tyrant's fashion of relieving himself in difficulties! FAUST Convey me thither! She shall be free! MEPHISTOPHELES And the danger to which thou dust expose thyself? Know, the guilt of blood, shed by thy hand, lies yet upon the town. Over the place where fell the murdered one, avenging spirits hover and watch for the returning murderer. FAUST This too from thee? The death and downfall of a world be on thee, monster I Conduct me thither, I say, and set her free! MEPHISTOPHELES I will conduct thee. And what I can do,--hear! Have I all power in heaven and upon earth? I'll cloud the senses of the warder,--do thou possess thyself of the keys and lead her forth with human hand! I will keep watch! The magic steeds are waiting, I bear thee off. Thus much is in my power. FAUST Tip and sway! NIGHT. OPEN COUNTRY FAUST. MEPHISTOPHELES (Rushing along on black horses) FAUST What weave they yonder round the Ravenstone? MEPHISTOPHELES I know not what they shape and brew. FAUST They're soaring, swooping, betiding, stooping. MEPHISTOPHELES A witches' pack. FAUST They charm, they strew. MEPHISTOPHELES On! On! DUNGEON FAUST (with a bunch of keys and a lamp before a small iron door) A fear unwonted o'er my spirit falls; Man's concentrated woe o'erwhelms me here! She dwells immur'd within these dripping walls; Her only trespass a delusion dear! Thou lingerest at the fatal door, Thou dread'st to see her face once more? On! While thou dalliest, draws her death-hour near. (He seizes the lock. Singing within.) My mother, the harlot, She took me and slew! My father, the scoundrel, Hath eaten me too! My sweet little sister Hath all my bones laid, Where soft breezes whisper All in the cool shade! Then became I a wood-bird, and sang on the spray, Fly away! little bird, fly away! fly away! FAUST (opening the lock) Ah! she forebodes not that her lover's near, The clanking chains, the rustling straw, to hear. (He enters.) MARGARET (hiding her face in the bed of straw) Woe! woe! they come! oh bitter 'tis to die! FAUST (softly) Hush! hush! be still! I come to set thee free! MARGARET (throwing herself at his feet) If thou art human, feel my misery! FAUST Thou wilt awake the jailor with thy cry! (He grasps the chains to unlock them.) MARGARET (on her knees) Who, headsman, unto thee this power O'er me could give? Thou com'st for me at midnight-hour. Be merciful, and let me live! Is morrow's dawn not time enough? (She stands up.) I'm still so young, so young-- And must so early die! Fair was I too, and that was my undoing. My love is now afar, he then was nigh; Torn lies the garland, the fair blossoms strew'd. Nay, seize me not with hand so rude! Spare me! What harm have I e'er done to thee? Oh let me not in vain implore! I ne'er have seen thee in my life before! FAUST Can I endure this bitter agony? MARGARET I now am at thy mercy quite. Let me my babe but suckle once again! I fondled it the live-long night; They took it from me but to give me pain, And now, they say that I my child have slain. Gladness I ne'er again shall know. Then they sing songs about me,--'tis wicked of the throng-- An ancient ballad endeth so; Who bade them thus apply the song? FAUST (throwing himself on the ground) A lover at thy feet bends low, To loose the bonds of wretchedness and woe. MARGARET (throws herself beside him) Oh, let us kneel and move the saints by prayer! Look! look! yon stairs below, Under the threshold there, Hell's flames are all aglow! Beneath the floor, With hideous noise, The devils roar! FAUST (aloud) Gretchen! Gretchen! MARGARET (listening) That was my lov'd one's voice! (She springs up, the chains fall off.) Where is he? I heard him calling me. Free am I! There's none shall hinder me. To his neck will I fly, On his bosom will lie! Gretchen, he called!-- On yon threshold he stood; Amidst all the howling of hell's fiery flood, The scoff and the scorn of its devilish crew, The tones of his voice, sweet and loving, I knew. FAUST 'Tis I! MARGARET 'Tis thou! O say so once again! (embracing him.) 'Tis he! 'Tis he! where's now the torturing pain? Where are the fetters? where the dungeon's gloom? 'Tis thou! To save me thou art come! And I am sav'd!-- Already now the street I see Where the first time I caught a glimpse of thee. There too the pleasant garden shade, Where I and Martha for thy coming stay'd. FAUST (endeavouring to lead her away,) Come! come away! MARGARET Oh do not haste! I love to linger where thou stayest. (caressing him.) FAUST Ah haste! For if thou still delayest, Our lingering we shall both deplore. MARGARET How, dearest? canst thou kiss no more! So short a time away from me, and yet, To kiss thou couldst so soon forget! Why on thy neck so anxious do I feel-- When formerly a perfect heaven of bliss From thy dear looks and words would o'er me steal? As thou wouldst stifle me thou then didst kiss!-- Kiss me! Or I'll kiss thee!  (She embraces him.) Woe! woe! Thy lips are cold,-- Are dumb! Thy love where hast thou left? Who bath me of thy love bereft? (She turns away from him.) FAUST Come! Follow me, my dearest love, be bold! I'll cherish thee with ardour thousand-fold; I but entreat thee now to follow me! MARGARET (turning towards him) And art thou he? and art thou really he? FAUST 'Tis I! O come! MARGARET Thou wilt strike off my chain, And thou wilt take me to thine arms again. How comes it that thou dost not shrink from me?-- And dost thou know, love, whom thou wouldst set free? FAUST Come! come! already night begins to wane. MARGARET I sent my mother to her grave, I drown'd my child beneath the wave. Was it not given to thee and me--thee too? 'Tis thou thyself! I scarce believe it yet. Give me thy hand! It is no dream! 'Tis true! Thine own dear hand!--But how is this? 'Tis wet? Quick, wipe it off! Meseems that yet There's blood thereon. Ah God! what hast thou done? Put up thy sword, I beg of thee! FAUST Oh, dearest, let the past forgotten be! Death is in every word. MARGARET No, thou must linger here in sorrow! The graves I will describe to thee, And thou to them must see To-morrow: The best place give to my mother, Close at her side my brother, Me at some distance lay-- But not too far away! And the little one place on my right breast. Nobody else will near me lie! To nestle beside thee so lovingly, That was a rapture, gracious and sweet! A rapture I never again shall prove; Methinks I would force myself on thee, love, And thou dost spurn me, and back retreat-- Yet 'tis thyself, thy fond kind looks I see. FAUST If thou dost feel 'tis I, then come with me! MARGARET What, there? without? FAUST Yes, forth in the free air. MARGARET Ay, if the grave's without,-- If death lurk there! Hence to the everlasting resting-place, And not one step beyond!-- Thou'rt leaving me? Oh Henry! would that I could go with thee! FAUST Thou canst! But will it! Open stands the door. MARGARET I dare not go! I've naught to hope for more. What boots it to escape? They lurk for me! 'Tis wretched to beg, as I must do, And with an evil conscience thereto! 'Tis wretched, in foreign lands to stray. And me they will catch, do what I may. FAUST With thee will I abide. MARGARET Quick! Quick! Save thy poor child! Keep to the path The brook along, Over the bridge To the wood beyond, To the left, where the plank is, In the pond. Seize it at once! It fain would rise, It struggles still! Save it. Oh save! FAUST Dear Gretchen, more collected be! One little step, and thou art free! MARGARET Were we but only past the hill! There sits my mother upon a stone-- My brain, alas, is cold with dread!-- There sits my mother upon a stone, And to and fro she shakes her head; She winks not, she nods not, her head it droops sore; She slept so long, she waked no more; She slept, that we might taste of bliss: Ah! those were happy times, I wis! FAUST Since here avails nor argument nor prayer, Thee hence by force I needs must bear. MARGARET Loose me! I will not suffer violence! With murderous hand hold not so fast! I have done all to please thee in the past! FAUST Day dawns! My love! My love! MARGARET Yes! day draws near. The day of judgment too will soon appear! It should have been my bridal! No one tell, That thy poor Gretchen thou hast known too well. Woe to my garland! Its bloom is o'er! Though not at the dance-- We shall meet once more. The crowd doth gather, in silence it rolls; The squares, the streets, Scarce hold the throng. The staff is broken,--the death-bell tolls,-- They bind and seize me! I'm hurried along, To the seat of blood already I'm bound! Quivers each neck as the naked steel Quivers on mine the blow to deal-- The silence of the grave now broods around! FAUST Would I had never been born! MEPHISTOPHELES (appears without) Up! or you're lost. Vain hesitation! Babbling, quaking! My steeds are shivering, Morn is breaking. MARGARET What from the floor ascendeth like a ghost? 'Tis he! 'Tis he! Him from my presence chase! What would he in this holy place? It is for me he cometh! FAUST Thou shalt live! MARGARET Judgment of God! To thee my soul I give! MEPHISTOPHELES (to FAUST) Come, come! With her I'll else abandon thee! MARGARET Father, I'm thine! Do thou deliver me! Ye angels! Ye angelic hosts! descend, Encamp around to guard me and defend!-- Henry! I shudder now to look on thee! MEPHISTOPHELES She now is judged! VOICES (from above) Is saved! MEPHISTOPHELES (to FAUST) Come thou with me! (Vanishes with FAUST) VOICE (from within, dying away) Henry! Henry!

ACT I LORD WILLIAM DROMONDY'S mansion in Park Lane.  Eight o'clock of the evening.  LITTLE ANNE DROMONDY and the large footman, JAMES, gaunt and grin, discovered in the wine cellar, by light of gas.  JAMES, in plush breeches, is selecting wine. L. ANNE: James, are you really James? JAMES.  No, my proper name's John. L. ANNE.  Oh!  [A pause]  And is Charles's an improper name too? JAMES.  His proper name's Mark. L. ANNE.  Then is Thomas Matthew? JAMES.  Miss Anne, stand clear o' that bin.  You'll put your foot through one o' those 'ock bottles. L. ANNE.  No, but James--Henry might be Luke, really? JAMES.  Now shut it, Miss Anne! L. ANNE.  Who gave you those names?  Not your godfathers and godmothers? JAMES.  Poulder.  Butlers think they're the Almighty.  [Gloomily] But his name's Bartholomew. L. ANNE.  Bartholomew Poulder?  It's rather jolly. JAMES.  It's hidjeous. L. ANNE.  Which do you like to be called--John or James? JAMES.  I don't give a darn. L. ANNE.  What is a darn? JAMES.  'Tain't in the dictionary. L. ANNE.  Do you like my name?  Anne Dromondy?  It's old, you know. But it's funny, isn't it? JAMES.  [Indifferently]  It'll pass. L. ANNE.  How many bottles have you got to pick out? JAMES.  Thirty-four. L. ANNE.  Are they all for the dinner, or for the people who come in to the Anti-Sweating Meeting afterwards? JAMES.  All for the dinner.  They give the Sweated--tea. L. ANNE.  All for the dinner?  They'll drink too much, won't they? JAMES.  We've got to be on the safe side. L. ANNE.  Will it be safer if they drink too much?      [JAMES pauses in the act of dusting a bottle to look at her, as      if suspecting irony.] [Sniffing]  Isn't the smell delicious here-like the taste of cherries when they've gone bad--[She sniffs again] and mushrooms; and boot blacking. JAMES.  That's the escape of gas. L. ANNE.  Has the plumber's man been? JAMES.  Yes. L. ANNE.  Which one? JAMES.  Little blighter I've never seen before. L. ANNE.  What is a little blighter?  Can I see? JAMES.  He's just gone. L. ANNE.  [Straying]  Oh!...  James, are these really the foundations? JAMES.  You might 'arf say so.  There's a lot under a woppin' big house like this; you can't hardly get to the bottom of it. L. ANNE.  Everything's built on something, isn't it?  And what's THAT built on? JAMES.  Ask another. L. ANNE.  If you wanted to blow it up, though, you'd have to begin from here, wouldn't you? JAMES.  Who'd want to blow it up? L. ANNE.  It would make a mess in Park Lane. JAMES.  I've seen a lot bigger messes than this'd make, out in the war. L. ANNE.  Oh!  but that's years ago!  Was it like this in the trenches, James? JAMES.  [Grimly]  Ah!  'Cept that you couldn't lay your 'and on a bottle o' port when you wanted one. L. ANNE.  Do you, when you want it, here? JAMES.  [On guard]  I only suggest it's possible. L. ANNE.  Perhaps Poulder does. JAMES.  [Icily]  I say nothin' about that. L. ANNE.  Oh!  Do say something! JAMES.  I'm ashamed of you, Miss Anne, pumpin' me! L. ANNE.  [Reproachfully]  I'm not pumpin'!  I only want to make Poulder jump when I ask him. JAMES.  [Grinning]  Try it on your own responsibility, then; don't bring me in! L. ANNE.  [Switching off]  James, do you think there's going to be a bloody revolution? JAMES.  [Shocked]  I shouldn't use that word, at your age. L. ANNE.  Why not?  Daddy used it this morning to Mother. [Imitating]  "The country's in an awful state, darling; there's going to be a bloody revolution, and we shall all be blown sky-high."  Do you like Daddy? JAMES.  [Taken aback]  Like Lord William?  What do you think?  We chaps would ha' done anything for him out there in the war. L. ANNE.  He never says that he always says he'd have done anything for you! JAMES.  Well--that's the same thing. L. ANNE.  It isn't--it's the opposite.  What is class hatred, James? JAMES.  [Wisely]  Ah!  A lot o' people thought when the war was over there'd be no more o' that.  [He sniggers]  Used to amuse me to read in the papers about the wonderful unity that was comin'.  I could ha' told 'em different. L. ANNE.  Why should people hate?  I like everybody. JAMES.  You know such a lot o' people, don't you? L. ANNE.  Well, Daddy likes everybody, and Mother likes everybody, except the people who don't like Daddy.  I bar Miss Stokes, of course; but then, who wouldn't? JAMES.  [With a touch of philosophy]  That's right--we all bars them that tries to get something out of us. L. ANNE.  Who do you bar, James? JAMES.  Well--[Enjoying the luxury of thought]--Speaking generally, I bar everybody that looks down their noses at me.  Out there in the trenches, there'd come a shell, and orf'd go some orficer's head, an' I'd think: That might ha' been me--we're all equal in the sight o' the stars.  But when I got home again among the torfs, I says to meself: Out there, ye know, you filled a hole as well as me; but here you've put it on again, with mufti. L. ANNE.  James, are your breeches made of mufti? JAMES.  [Contemplating his legs with a certain contempt]  Ah! Footmen were to ha' been off; but Lord William was scared we wouldn't get jobs in the rush.  We're on his conscience, and it's on my conscience that I've been on his long enough--so, now I've saved a bit, I'm goin' to take meself orf it. L. ANNE.  Oh!  Are you going?  Where? JAMES.  [Assembling the last bottles]  Out o' Blighty! L. ANNE.  Is a little blighter a little Englishman? JAMES.  [Embarrassed]  Well-'e can be. L. ANNE [Mining]  James--we're quite safe down here, aren't we, in a revolution?  Only, we wouldn't have fun.  Which would you rather--be safe, or have fun? JAMES.  [Grimly]  Well, I had my bit o' fun in the war. L. ANNE.  I like fun that happens when you're not looking. JAMES.  Do you?  You'd ha' been just suited. L. ANNE.  James, is there a future life?  Miss Stokes says so. JAMES.  It's a belief, in the middle classes. L. ANNE.  What are the middle classes? JAMES.  Anything from two 'undred a year to supertax. L. ANNE.  Mother says they're terrible.  Is Miss Stokes middle class? JAMES.  Yes. L. ANNE.  Then I expect they are terrible.  She's awfully virtuous, though, isn't she? JAMES.  'Tisn't so much the bein' virtuous, as the lookin' it, that's awful. L. ANNE.  Are all the middle classes virtuous?  Is Poulder? JAMES.  [Dubiously]  Well.  Ask him! L. ANNE.  Yes, I will.  Look!      [From an empty bin on the ground level she picks up a lighted      taper,--burnt almost to the end.] JAMES.  [Contemplating it]  Careless! L.  Ate.  Oh!  And look!  [She paints to a rounded metal object lying in the bin, close to where the taper was]  It's a bomb! She is about to pick it up when JAMES takes her by the waist and puts her aside. JAMES.  [Sternly]  You stand back, there!  I don't like the look o' that! L. ANNE.  [With intense interest]  Is it really a bomb?  What fun! JAMES.  Go and fetch Poulder while I keep an eye on it. L. ANNE.  [On tiptoe of excitement]  If only I can make him jump! Oh, James!  we needn't put the light out, need we? JAMES.  No.  Clear off and get him, and don't you come back. L. ANNE.  Oh! but I must!  I found it! JAMES.  Cut along. L. ANNE.  Shall we bring a bucket? JAMES.  Yes.  [ANNE flies off.] [Gazing at the object]  Near go!  Thought I'd seen enough o'them to last my time.  That little gas blighter!  He looked a rum 'un, too--one o' these 'ere Bolshies.      [In the presence of this grim object the habits of the past are      too much for him.  He sits on the ground, leaning against one of      the bottle baskets, keeping his eyes on the bomb, his large,      lean, gorgeous body spread, one elbow on his plush knee.  Taking      out an empty pipe, he places it mechanically, bowl down, between      his dips.  There enter, behind him, as from a communication      trench, POULDER, in swallow-tails, with LITTLE ANNE behind him.] L. ANNE.  [Peering round him--ecstatic]  Hurrah!  Not gone off yet! It can't--can it--while James is sitting on it? POULDER.  [Very broad and stout, with square shoulders,--a large ruddy face, and a small mouth]  No noise, Miss.--James. JAMES.  Hallo! POULDER.  What's all this? JAMES.  Bomb! POULDER.  Miss Anne, off you go, and don't you---- L. ANNE.  Come back again!  I know!  [She flies.] JAMES.  [Extending his hand with the pipe in it]  See! POULDER.  [Severely]  You've been at it again!  Look here, you're not in the trenches now.  Get up!  What are your breeches goin' to be like?  You might break a bottle any moment! JAMES.  [Rising with a jerk to a sort of "Attention!"]  Look here, you starched antiquity, you and I and that bomb are here in the sight of the stars.  If you don't look out I'll stamp on it and blow us all to glory!  Drop your civilian swank! POULDER.  [Seeing red]  Ho!  Because you had the privilege of fightin' for your country you still think you can put it on, do you? Take up your wine! 'Pon my word, you fellers have got no nerve left!      [JAMES makes a sudden swoop, lifts the bomb and poises it in      both hands.  POULDER recoils against a bin and gazes, at the      object.] JAMES.  Put up your hands! POULDER.  I defy you to make me ridiculous. JAMES.  [Fiercely]  Up with 'em!      [POULDER'S hands go up in an uncontrollable spasm, which he      subdues almost instantly, pulling them down again.] JAMES.  Very good. [He lowers the bomb.] POULDER.  [Surprised] I never lifted 'em. JAMES.  You'd have made a first-class Boche, Poulder.  Take the bomb yourself; you're in charge of this section. POULDER.  [Pouting]  It's no part of my duty to carry menial objects; if you're afraid of it I'll send 'Enry. JAMES.  Afraid!  You 'Op o' me thumb!      [From the "communication trench" appears LITTLE ANNE, followed      by a thin, sharp, sallow-faced man of thirty-five or so, and      another FOOTMAN, carrying a wine-cooler.] L. ANNE.  I've brought the bucket, and the Press. PRESS.  [In front of POULDER'S round eyes and mouth]  Ah, major domo, I was just taking the names of the Anti-Sweating dinner.  [He catches sight of the bomb in JAMES'S hand]  By George!  What A.1. irony!  [He brings out a note-book and writes]  "Highest class dining to relieve distress of lowest class-bombed by same!"  Tipping!  [He rubs his hands]. POULDER.  [Drawing himself up]  Sir?  This is present!  [He indicates ANNE with the flat of his hand.] L. ANNE.  I found the bomb. PRESS.  [Absorbed]  By Jove!  This is a piece of luck!  [He writes.] POULDER.  [Observing him]  This won't do--it won't do at all! PRESS.  [Writing-absorbed]  "Beginning of the British Revolution!" POULDER.  [To JAMES]  Put it in the cooler.  'Enry, 'old up the cooler.  Gently!  Miss Anne, get be'ind the Press. JAMES.  [Grimly--holding the bomb above the cooler]  It won't be the Press that'll stop Miss Anne's goin' to 'Eaven if one o' this sort goes off.  Look out!  I'm goin' to drop it.      [ALL recoil.  HENRY puts the cooler down and backs away.] L. ANNE.  [Dancing forward]  Oh!  Let me see!  I missed all the war, you know!      [JAMES lowers the bomb into the cooler.] POULDER.  [Regaining courage--to THE PRESS, who is scribbling in his note-book]  If you mention this before the police lay their hands on it, it'll be contempt o' Court. PRESS.  [Struck]  I say, major domo, don't call in the police! That's the last resort.  Let me do the Sherlocking for you.  Who's been down here? L. ANNE.  The plumber's man about the gas---a little blighter we'd never seen before. JAMES.  Lives close by, in Royal Court Mews--No. 3.  I had a word with him before he came down.  Lemmy his name is. PRESS.  "Lemmy!" [Noting the address] Right-o! L. ANNE.  Oh!  Do let me come with you! POULDER.  [Barring the way]  I've got to lay it all before Lord William. PRESS.  Ah!  What's he like? POULDER.  [With dignity]  A gentleman, sir. PRESS.  Then he won't want the police in. POULDER.  Nor the Press, if I may go so far, as to say so. PRESS.  One to you!  But I defy you to keep this from the Press, major domo: This is the most significant thing that has happened in our time.  Guy Fawkes is nothing to it.  The foundations of Society reeling!  By George, it's a second Bethlehem!      [He writes.] POULDER.  [To JAMES] Take up your wine and follow me.  'Enry, bring the cooler.  Miss Anne, precede us.  [To THE PRESS]  You defy me? Very well; I'm goin' to lock you up here. PRESS.  [Uneasy]  I say this is medieval.      [He attempts to pass.] POULDER.  [Barring the way]  Not so!  James, put him up in that empty 'ock bin.  We can't have dinner disturbed in any way. JAMES.  [Putting his hands on THE PRESS'S shoulders]  Look here--go quiet!  I've had a grudge against you yellow newspaper boys ever since the war--frothin' up your daily hate, an' makin' the Huns desperate.  You nearly took my life five hundred times out there.  If you squeal, I'm gain' to take yours once--and that'll be enough. PRESS.  That's awfully unjust.  Im not yellow! JAMES.  Well, you look it.  Hup. PRESS. Little Lady-Anne, haven't you any authority with these fellows? L. ANNE.  [Resisting Poulard's pressure]  I won't go!  I simply must see James put him up! PRESS.  Now, I warn you all plainly--there'll be a leader on this.      [He tries to bolt but is seized by JAMES.] JAMES.  [Ironically]  Ho! PRESS.  My paper has the biggest influence JAMES.  That's the one!  Git up in that 'ock bin, and mind your feet among the claret. PRESS.  This is an outrage on the Press. JAMES.  Then it'll wipe out one by the Press on the Public--an' leave just a million over!  Hup! POULDER.  'Enry, give 'im an 'and.      [THE PRESS mounts, assisted by JAMES and HENRY.] L. ANNE.  [Ecstatic]  It's lovely! POULDER.  [Nervously]  Mind the '87!  Mind! JAMES.  Mind your feet in Mr. Poulder's favourite wine!      [A WOMAN'S voice is heard, as from the depths of a cave, calling      "Anne!  Anne!"] L. ANNE.  [Aghast]  Miss Stokes--I must hide!      [She gets behind POULDER.  The three Servants achieve dignified      positions in front of the bins.  The voice comes nearer.  THE      PRESS sits dangling his feet, grinning.  MISS STOKES appears.      She is woman of forty-five and terribly good manners.  Her      greyish hair is rolled back off her forehead.  She is in a high      evening dress, and in the dim light radiates a startled      composure.] MISS STOKES.  Poulder, where is Miss Anne?      [ANNE lays hold of the backs of his legs.] POULDER.  [Wincing]  I am not in a position to inform you, Miss. MISS S.  They told me she was down here.  And what is all this about a bomb? POULDER.  [Lifting his hand in a calming manner]  The crisis is past; we have it in ice, Miss.  'Enry, show Miss Stokes!  [HENRY indicates the cooler.] MISS S.  Good gracious!  Does Lord William know? POULDER.  Not at present, Miss. MISS S.  But he ought to, at once. POULDER.  We 'ave 'ad complications. MISS S.  [Catching sight of the legs of THE PRESS]  Dear me!  What are those? JAMES.  [Gloomily]  The complications.      [MISS STOKES pins up her glasses and stares at them.] PRESS.  [Cheerfully]  Miss Stokes, would you kindly tell Lord William I'm here from the Press, and would like to speak to him? MISS S.  But--er--why are you up there? JAMES.  'E got up out o' remorse, Miss. MISS S.  What do you mean, James? PRESS.  [Warmly]  Miss Stokes, I appeal to you.  Is it fair to attribute responsibility to an unsigned journalist--for what he has to say? JAMES.  [Sepulchrally]  Yes, when you've got 'im in a nice dark place. MISS. S.   James, be more respectful!  We owe the Press a very great debt. JAMES.  I'm goin' to pay it, Miss. MISS S.  [At a loss]  Poulder, this is really most---- POULDER.  I'm bound to keep the Press out of temptation, miss, till I've laid it all before Lord William.  'Enry, take up the cooler. James, watch 'im till we get clear, then bring on the rest of the wine and lock up.  Now, Miss. MISS S.  But where is Anne? PRESS.  Miss Stokes, as a lady----! MISS S.  I shall go and fetch Lord William! POULDER.  We will all go, Miss. L. ANNE.  [Rushing out from behind his legs]  No--me!      [She eludes MISS STOKES and vanishes, followed by that      distracted but still well-mannered lady.] POULDER.  [Looking at his watch]  'Enry, leave the cooler, and take up the wine; tell Thomas to lay it out; get the champagne into ice, and 'ave Charles 'andy in the 'all in case some literary bounder comes punctual.      [HENRY takes up the wine and goes.] PRESS.  [Above his head]  I say, let me down.  This is a bit undignified, you know.  My paper's a great organ. POULDER. [After a moment's hesitation]  Well--take 'im down, James; he'll do some mischief among the bottles. JAMES.  'Op off your base, and trust to me.      [THE PRESS slides off the bin's edge, is received by JAMES, and      not landed gently.] POULDER.  [Contemplating him]  The incident's closed; no ill-feeling, I hope? PRESS.  No-o. POULDER.  That's right.  [Clearing his throat]  While we're waitin' for Lord William--if you're interested in wine--[Philosophically] you can read the history of the times in this cellar.  Take 'ock: [He points to a bin]  Not a bottle gone.  German product, of course. Now, that 'ock is 'sa 'avin' the time of its life--maturin' grandly; got a wonderful chance.  About the time we're bringin' ourselves to drink it, we shall be havin' the next great war.  With luck that 'ock may lie there another quarter of a century, and a sweet pretty wine it'll be.  I only hope I may be here to drink it.  Ah! [He shakes his head]--but look at claret!  Times are hard on claret.  We're givin' it an awful doin'.  Now, there's a Ponty Canny [He points to a bin] if we weren't so 'opelessly allied with France, that wine would have a reasonable future.  As it is--none!  We drink it up and up; not more than sixty dozen left.  And where's its equal to come from for a dinner wine--ah!  I ask you?  On the other hand, port is steady; made in a little country, all but the cobwebs and the old boot flavour; guaranteed by the British Nary; we may 'ope for the best with port. Do you drink it? PRESS.  When I get the chance. POULDER.  Ah! [Clears his throat]  I've often wanted to ask: What do they pay you--if it's not indelicate? [THE PRESS shrugs his shoulders.] Can you do it at the money? [THE PRESS shakes his head.]  Still--it's an easy life!  I've regretted sometimes that I didn't have a shot at it myself; influencin' other people without disclosin' your identity--something very attractive about that.  [Lowering his voice]  Between man and man, now-what do you think of the situation of the country--these processions of the unemployed--the Red Flag an' the Marsillaisy in the streets--all this talk about an upheaval? PRESS.  Well, speaking as a Socialist---- POULDER. [Astounded] Why; I thought your paper was Tory! PRESS.  So it is.  That's nothing! POULDER.  [Open-mouthed]  Dear me!  [Pointing to the bomb] Do you really think there's something in this? JAMES.  [Sepulchrally]  'Igh explosive. PRESS.  [Taking out his note-book]  Too much, anyway, to let it drop.      [A pleasant voice calls "Poulder! Hallo!".] POULDER.  [Forming a trumpet with his hand]  Me Lord!      [As LORD WILLIAM appears, JAMES, overcome by reminiscences;      salutes, and is mechanically answered.  LORD WILLIAM has      "charm."  His hair and moustache are crisp and just beginning to      grizzle.  His bearing is free, easy, and only faintly armoured.      He will go far to meet you any day.  He is in full evening      dress.] LORD W.  [Cheerfully]  I say, Poulder, what have you and James been doing to the Press?  Liberty of the Press--it isn't what it was, but there is a limit.  Where is he?      [He turns to Jams between whom and himself there is still the      freemasonry of the trenches.] JAMES.  [Pointing to POULDER]  Be'ind the parapet, me Lord.      [THE PRESS mopes out from where he has involuntarily been.      screened by POULDER, who looks at JAMES severely.  LORD WILLIAM      hides a smile.] PRESS.  Very glad to meet you, Lord William.  My presence down here is quite involuntary. LORD W.  [With a charming smile]  I know.  The Press has to put its-- er--to go to the bottom of everything.  Where's this bomb, Poulder? Ah!      [He looks into the wine cooler.] PRESS.  [Taking out his note-book]  Could I have a word with you on the crisis, before dinner, Lord William? LORD W.  It's time you and James were up, Poulder.  [Indicating the cooler]  Look after this; tell Lady William I'll be there in a minute. POULDER.  Very good, me Lord.      [He goes, followed by JAMES carrying the cooler.]      [As THE PRESS turns to look after them, LORD WILLIAM catches      sight of his back.] LORD W.  I must apologise, sir.  Can I brush you? PRESS.  [Dusting himself]  Thanks; it's only behind.  [He opens his note-book]  Now, Lord William, if you'd kindly outline your views on the national situation; after such a narrow escape from death, I feel they might have a moral effect.  My paper, as you know, is concerned with--the deeper aspect of things.  By the way, what do you value your house and collection at? LORD W.  [Twisting his little mustache]  Really: I can't!  Really! PRESS.  Might I say a quarter of a million-lifted in two seconds and a half-hundred thousand to the second.  It brings it home, you know. LORD W.  No, no; dash it!  No! PRESS.  [Disappointed]  I see--not draw attention to your property in the present excited state of public feeling?  Well, suppose we approach it from the viewpoint of the Anti-Sweating dinner.  I have the list of guests--very weighty! LORD W.  Taken some lifting-wouldn't they? PRESS.  [Seriously]  May I say that you designed the dinner to soften the tension, at this crisis?  You saw that case, I suppose, this morning, of the woman dying of starvation in Bethnal Green? LORD W.  [Desperately]  Yes-yes!  I've been horribly affected.  I always knew this slump would come after the war, sooner or later. PRESS.  [Writing]  "...  had predicted slump." LORD W.  You see, I've been an Anti-Sweating man for years, and I thought if only we could come together now.... PRESS.  [Nodding]  I see--I see!  Get Society interested in the Sweated, through the dinner.  I have the menu here. [He produces it.] LORD W.  Good God, man--more than that!  I want to show the people that we stand side by side with them, as we did in the trenches.  The whole thing's too jolly awful.  I lie awake over it.      [He walks up and down.] PRESS.  [Scribbling]  One moment, please.  I'll just get that down-- "Too jolly awful--lies awake over it.  Was wearing a white waistcoat with pearl buttons."  [At a sign of resentment from his victim.] I want the human touch, Lord William--it's everything in my paper. What do you say about this attempt to bomb you? LORD W.  Well, in a way I think it's d---d natural PRESS.  [Scribbling]  "Lord William thought it d---d natural." LORD W.  [Overhearing]  No, no; don't put that down.  What I mean is, I should like to get hold of those fellows that are singing the Marseillaise about the streets--fellows that have been in the war-- real sports they are, you know--thorough good chaps at bottom--and say to them: "Have a feeling heart, boys; put yourself in my position."  I don't believe a bit they'd want to bomb me then.      [He walks up and down.] PRESS.  [Scribbling and muttering] "The idea, of brotherhood--" D'you mind my saying that?  Word brotherhood--always effective--always----      [He writes.] LORD E.  [Bewildered]  "Brotherhood!" Well, it's pure accident that I'm here and they're there.  All the same, I can't pretend to be starving.  Can't go out into Hyde Park and stand on a tub, can I? But if I could only show them what I feel--they're such good chaps-- poor devils. PRESS.  I quite appreciate!  [He writes]  "Camel and needle's eye." You were at Eton and Oxford?  Your constituency I know.  Clubs?  But I can get all that.  Is it your view that Christianity is on the up-grade, Lord William? LORD W.  [Dubious]  What d'you mean by Christianity--loving--kindness and that?  Of course I think that dogma's got the knock.      [He walks.] PRESS.  [Writing]  "Lord William thought dogma had got the knock." I should like you just to develop your definition of Christianity. "Loving--kindness" strikes rather a new note. LORD W.  New?  What about the Sermon on the Mount? PRESS.  [Writing]  "Refers to Sermon on Mount."  I take it you don't belong to any Church, Lord William? LORD W.  [Exasperated]  Well, really--I've been baptised and that sort of thing.  But look here---- PRESS.  Oh!  you can trust me--I shan't say anything that you'll regret.  Now, do you consider that a religious revival would help to quiet the country? LORD W.  Well, I think it would be a deuced, good thing if everybody were a bit more kind. PRESS.  Ah!  [Musing]  I feel that your views are strikingly original, Lord William.  If you could just open out on them a little more?  How far would you apply kindness in practice? LORD W.  Can you apply it in theory? PRESS.  I believe it is done.  But would you allow yourself to be blown up with impunity? LORD W.  Well, that's a bit extreme.  But I quite sympathise with this chap.  Imagine yourself in his shoes.  He sees a huge house, all these bottles; us swilling them down; perhaps he's got a starving wife, or consumptive kids. PRESS.  [Writing and murmuring]  Um-m!  "Kids." LORD W.  He thinks: "But for the grace of God, there swill I.  Why should that blighter have everything and I nothing?" and all that. PRESS.  [Writing]  "And all that."  [Eagerly]  Yes? LORD W.  And gradually--you see--this contrast--becomes an obsession with him.  "There's got to be an example made," he thinks; and--er-- he makes it, don't you know? PRESS.  [Writing]  Ye-es?  And--when you're the example? LORD W.  Well, you feel a bit blue, of course.  But my point is that you quite see it. PRESS.  From the other world.  Do you believe in a future life, Lord William?  The public took a lot of interest in the question, if you remember, at the time of the war.  It might revive at any moment, if there's to be a revolution. LORD W.  The wish is always father to the thought, isn't it? PRESS.  Yes!  But--er--doesn't the question of a future life rather bear on your point about kindness?  If there isn't one--why be kind? LORD W.  Well, I should say one oughtn't to be kind for any motive-- that's self-interest; but just because one feels it, don't you know. PRESS.  [Writing vigorously]  That's very new--very new! LORD W.  [Simply]  You chaps are wonderful. PRESS.  [Doubtfully]  You mean we're--we're---- LORD W.  No, really.  You have such a d---d hard time.  It must be perfectly beastly to interview fellows like me. PRESS.  Oh!  Not at all, Lord William.  Not at all.  I assure you compared with a literary man, it's--it's almost heavenly. LORD W.  You must have a wonderful knowledge of things. PRESS.  [Bridling a little]  Well--I shouldn't say that. LORD W.  I don't see how you can avoid it.  You turn your hands to everything. PRESS.  [Modestly]  Well--yes, Yes. LORD W.  I say:  Is there really going to be a revolution, or are you making it up, you Press? PRESS.  We don't know.  We never know whether we come before the event, or it comes before us. LORD W.  That's--very deep--very dip.  D'you mind lending me your note-book a moment.  I'd like to stick that down.  All right, I'll use the other end.  [THE PRESS hands it hypnotically.] LORD W.  [Jotting]  Thanks awfully.  Now what's your real opinion of the situation? PRESS.  As a man or a Press man? LORD W.  Is there any difference? PRESS.  Is there any connection? LORD W.  Well, as a man. PRESS.  As a man, I think it's rotten. LORD W.  [Jotting]  "Rotten."  And as a pressman? PRESS.  [Smiling]  Prime. LORD W.  What!  Like a Stilton cheese.  Ha, ha!      [He is about to write.] PRESS.  My stunt, Lord William.  You said that.      [He jots it on his cuff.] LORD W.  But look here!  Would you say that a strong press movement would help to quiet the country? PRESS.  Well, as you ask me, Lord William, I'll tell you.  No newspapers for a month would do the trick. LORD W.  [Jotting]  By Jove!  That's brilliant. PRESS.  Yes, but I should starve.  [He suddenly looks up, and his eyes, like gimlets, bore their way into LORD WILLIAM'S pleasant, troubled face]  Lord William, you could do me a real kindness. Authorise me to go and interview the fellow who left the bomb here; I've got his address.  I promise you to do it most discreetly.  Fact is--well--I'm in low water.  Since the war we simply can't get sensation enough for the new taste.  Now, if I could have an article headed: "Bombed and Bomber"--sort of double interview, you know, it'd very likely set me on my legs again.  [Very earnestly]  Look! [He holds out his frayed wristbands.] LORD W.  [Grasping his hand]  My dear chap, certainly.  Go and interview this blighter, and then bring him round here.  You can do that for one.  I'd very much like to see him, as a matter of fact. PRESS.  Thanks awfully; I shall never forget it.  Oh!  might I have my note-book?      [LORD WILLIAM hands it back.] LORD W.  And look here, if there's anything--when a fellow's fortunate and another's not---- [He puts his hand into his breast pocket.] PRESS.  Oh, thank you!  But you see, I shall have to write you up a bit, Lord William.  The old aristocracy--you know what the public still expects; if you were to lend me money, you might feel---- LORD W.  By Jove!  Never should have dreamt---- PRESS.  No!  But it wouldn't do.  Have you a photograph of yourself. LORD W.  Not on me. PRESS.  Pity!  By the way, has it occurred to you that there may be another bomb on the premises? LORD W.  Phew!  I'll have a look.      [He looks at his watch, and begins hurriedly searching the bins,      bending down and going on his knees.  THE PRESS reverses the      notebook again and sketches him.] PRESS.  [To himself]  Ah!  That'll do.  "Lord William examines the foundations of his house."      [A voice calls "Bill!" THE PRESS snaps the note-book to, and      looks up.  There, where the "communication trench" runs in,      stands a tall and elegant woman in the extreme of evening      dress.]      [With presence of mind]  Lady William?  You'll find Lord William --Oh!  Have you a photograph of him? LADY W.  Not on me. PRESS.  [Eyeing her]  Er--no--I suppose not--no.  Excuse me!  [He sidles past her and is gone.] LADY W.  [With lifted eyebrows]  Bill! LORD W.  [Emerging, dusting his knees]  Hallo, Nell!  I was just making sure there wasn't another bomb. LADY W.  Yes; that's why I came dawn: Who was that person? LORD W.  Press. LADY W.  He looked awfully yellow.  I hope you haven't been giving yourself away. LORD W.  [Dubiously]  Well, I don't know.  They're like corkscrews. LADY W.  What did he ask you? LORD W.  What didn't he? LADY W.  Well, what did you tell him? LORD W.  That I'd been baptised--but he promised not to put it down. LADY W.  Bill, you are absurd.      [She gives a light tittle laugh.] LORD W.  I don't remember anything else, except that it was quite natural we should be bombed, don't you know. LADY W.  Why, what harm have we done? LORD W.  Been born, my dear.  [Suddenly serious]  I say, Nell, how am I to tell what this fellow felt when he left that bomb here? LADY W.  Why do you want to? LORD W.  Out there one used to know what one's men felt. LADY W.  [Staring]  My dear boy, I really don't think you ought to see the Press; it always upsets you. LORD W.  Well!  Why should you and I be going to eat ourselves silly to improve the condition of the sweated, when---- LADY W.  [Calmly]  When they're going to "improve" ours, if we don't look out.  We've got to get in first, Bill. LORD W.  [Gloomily]  I know.  It's all fear.  That's it!  Here we are, and here we shall stay--as if there'd never been a war. LADY W.  Well, thank heaven there's no "front" to a revolution.  You and I can go to glory together this time.  Compact!  Anything that's on, I'm to abate in. LORD W.  Well, in reason. LADY W.  No, in rhyme, too. LORD W.  I say, your dress! LADY W.  Yes, Poulder tried to stop me, but I wasn't going to have you blown up without me. LORD W.  You duck.  You do look stunning.  Give us a kiss! LADY W.  [Starting back]  Oh, Bill!  Don't touch me--your hands! LORD W.  Never mind, my mouth's clean. They stand about a yard apart, and banding their faces towards each other, kiss on the lips. L. ANNE.  [Appearing suddenly from the "communication trench," and tip-toeing silently between them]  Oh, Mum!  You and Daddy ARE wasting time!  Dinner's ready, you know!                               CURTAIN ACT II      The single room of old MRS. LEMMY, in a small grey house in      Bethnal Green, the room of one cumbered by little save age, and      the crockery debris of the past.  A bed, a cupboard, a coloured      portrait of Queen Victoria, and--of all things--a fiddle,      hanging on the wall.  By the side of old MRS. LEMMY in her chair      is a pile of corduroy trousers, her day's sweated sewing, and a      small table.  She sits with her back to the window, through      which, in the last of the light, the opposite side of the little      grey street is visible under the evening sky, where hangs one      white cloud shaped like a horned beast.  She is still sewing,      and her lips move.  Being old, and lonely, she has that habit of      talking to herself, distressing to those who cannot overhear.      From the smack of her tongue she was once a West Country cottage      woman; from the look of her creased, parchmenty face, she was      once a pretty girl with black eyes, in which there is still much      vitality.  The door is opened with difficulty and a little girl      enters, carrying a pile of unfinished corduroy trousers nearly      as large as herself. She puts them down against the wall, and      advances.  She is eleven or twelve years old; large-eyed, dark      haired, and sallow.  Half a woman of this and half of another      world, except when as now, she is as irresponsible a bit of life      as a little flowering weed growing out of a wall.  She stands      looking at MRS. LEMMY with dancing eyes. L. AIDA.  I've brought yer to-morrer's trahsers.  Y'nt yer finished wiv to-dy's?  I want to tyke 'em. MRS. L.  No, me dear.  Drat this last one--me old fengers! L. AIDA.  I learnt some poytry to-dy--I did. MRS. L.  Well, I never! L. AIDA.  [Reciting with unction]          "Little lamb who myde thee?           Dost thou know who myde thee,           Gyve thee life and byde thee feed           By the stream and oer the mead;           Gyve the clothing of delight,           Softest clothing, woolly, bright;           Gyve thee such a tender voice,           Myking all the vyles rejoice.                Little lamb who myde thee?                Dost thou know who myde thee?" MRS. L.  'Tes wonderful what things they tache ya nowadays. L.  AIDA.  When I grow up I'm goin' to 'ave a revolver an' shoot the people that steals my jools. MRS. L.  Deary-me, wherever du yu get yore notions? L. AIDA.  An' I'm goin' to ride on as 'orse be'ind a man; an' I'm goin' to ryce trynes in my motor car. MRS. L.  [Dryly]  Ah!--Yu'um gwine to be very busy, that's sartin. Can you sew? L. AIDA.  [With a Smile]  Nao. MRS. L.  Don' they tache Yu that, there? L. AIDA.  [Blending contempt and a lingering curiosity]  Nao. MRS. L.  'Tes wonderful genteel. L. AIDA.  I can sing, though. MRS. L.  Let's 'ear yu, then. L. AIDA.  [Shaking her head]  I can ply the pianner.  I can ply a tune. MRS. L.  Whose pianner? L. AIDA.  Mrs. Brahn's when she's gone aht. MRS. L.  Well, yu are gettin' edjucation!  Du they tache yu to love yore neighbours? L. AIDA.  [Ineffably]  Nao.  [Straying to the window]  Mrs. Lemmy, what's the moon? MRS. L.  The mune?  Us used to zay 'twas made o' crame cheese. L. AIDA.  I can see it. MRS. L.  Ah!  Don' yu never go wishin' for it, me dear. L. AIDA.  I daon't. MRS. L.  Folks as wish for the mune never du no gude. L. AIDA.  [Craning out, brilliant]  I'm goin' dahn in the street. I'll come back for yer trahsers. MRS. L.  Well; go yu, then, and get a breath o' fresh air in yore chakes.  I'll sune 'a feneshed. L. AIDA.  [Solemnly]  I'm goin' to be a dancer, I am. She rushes suddenly to the door, pulls it open, and is gone. MRS. L.  [Looking after her, and talking to herself.]  Ah!  'Er've a-got all 'er troubles before 'er!  "Little lamb, a made'ee?" [Cackling]  'Tes a funny world, tu! [She sings to herself.]          "There is a green 'ill far away                Without a city wall,           Where our dear-Lord was crucified,                'U died to save us all."      The door is opened, and LEMMY comes in; a little man with a      stubble of dark moustache and spiky dark hair; large, peculiar      eyes he has, and a look of laying his ears back, a look of      doubting, of perversity with laughter up the sleeve, that grows      on those who have to do with gas and water.  He shuts the door. MRS. L.  Well, Bob, I 'aven't a-seen yu this tu weeks.      LEMMY comes up to his mother, and sits down on a stool, sets a      tool-bag between his knees, and speaks in a cockney voice. LEMMY.  Well, old lydy o' leisure!  Wot would y' 'ave for supper, if yer could choose--salmon wivaht the tin, an' tipsy cyke? MRS. L.  [Shaking her head and smiling blandly]  That's showy.  Toad in the 'ole I'd 'ave--and a glass o' port wine. LEMMY.  Providential.  [He opens a tool-bag]  Wot dyer think I've got yer? MRS. L.  I 'ope yu've a-got yureself a job, my son! LEMMY.  [With his peculiar smile]  Yus, or I couldn't 'ave afforded yer this.  [He takes out a bottle]  Not 'arf!  This'll put the blood into yer.  Pork wine--once in the cellars of the gryte.  We'll drink the ryyal family in this. [He apostrophises the portrait of Queen Victoria.] MRS. L. Ah!  She was a praaper gude queen.  I see 'er once, when 'er was bein' burried. LEMMY.  Ryalties--I got nothin' to sy agynst 'em in this country. But the STYTE 'as got to 'ave its pipes seen to.  The 'ole show's goin' up pop.  Yer'll wyke up one o' these dyes, old lydy, and find yerself on the roof, wiv nuffin' between yer an' the grahnd. MRS. L.  I can't tell what yu'm talkin' about. LEMMY.  We're goin' to 'ave a triumpherat in this country Liberty, Equality, Fraternity; an' if yer arsk me, they won't be in power six months before they've cut each other's throats.  But I don't care--I want to see the blood flow!  (Dispassionately) I don' care 'oose blood it is.  I want to see it flow! MRS. L.  [Indulgently]  Yu'm a funny boy, that's sartin. LEMMY. [Carving at the cork with a knife] This 'ere cork is like Sasiety--rotten; it's old--old an' moulderin'.  [He holds up a bit of cork on the point of the knife]  Crumblin' under the wax, it is.  In goes the screw an' out comes the cork.  [With unction]--an' the blood flows.  [Tipping the bottle, he lets a drop fall into the middle of his hand, and licks it up.  Gazing with queer and doubting commiseration at has mother]  Well, old dear, wot shall we 'ave it aht of--the gold loving-cup, or--what?  'Ave yer supper fust, though, or it'll go to yer 'ead!  [He goes to the cupboard and taken out a disk in which a little bread is sopped in a little' milk]  Cold pap! 'Ow can yer?  'Yn't yer got a kipper in the 'ouse? MRS. L.  [Admiring the bottle]  Port wine!  'Tis a brave treat!  I'll 'ave it out of the "Present from Margitt," Bob.  I tuk 'ee therr by excursion when yu was six months.  Yu 'ad a shrimp an' it choked yu praaperly.  Yu was always a squeamy little feller.  I can't never think 'ow yu managed in the war-time, makin' they shells.      LEMMY, who has brought to the table two mugs and blown the duet      out of; them, fills them with port, and hands one to his mother,      who is eating her bread and milk. LEMMY.  Ah!  Nothin' worried me, 'cept the want o' soap. MRS. L.  [Cackling gently]  So it du still, then!  Luke at yore face. Yu never was a clean boy, like Jim.      [She puts out a thin finger and touches his cheek, whereon is a      black smudge.] LEMMY.  [Scrubbing his cheek with his sleeve.]  All right!  Y'see, I come stryte 'ere, to get rid o' this.      [He drinks.] MRS.  L.  [Eating her bread and milk]  Tes a pity yu'm not got a wife to see't yu wash yureself. LEMMY.  [Goggling]  Wife!  Not me--I daon't want ter myke no food for pahder.  Wot oh!--they said, time o' the war--ye're fightin' for yer children's 'eritage.  Well; wot's the 'eritage like, now we've got it?  Empty as a shell before yer put the 'igh explosive in.  Wot's it like?  [Warming to his theme]  Like a prophecy in the pypers--not a bit more substantial. MRS. L.  [Slightly hypnotised]  How 'e du talk!  The gas goes to yore 'ead, I think! LEMMY.  I did the gas to-dy in the cellars of an 'ouse where the wine was mountains 'igh.  A regiment couldn't 'a drunk it.  Marble pillars in the 'all, butler broad as an observytion balloon, an' four conscientious khaki footmen.  When the guns was roarin' the talk was all for no more o' them glorious weeds-style an' luxury was orf.  See wot it is naow.  You've got a bare crust in the cupboard 'ere, I works from 'and to mouth in a glutted market--an' there they stand abaht agyne in their britches in the 'oases o' the gryte.  I was reg'lar overcome by it.  I left a thing in that cellar--I left a thing....  It'll be a bit ork'ard for me to-mower.  [Drinks from his mug.] MRS. L.  [Placidly, feeling the warmth of the little she has drunk] What thing? LEMMY.  Wot thing?  Old lydy, ye're like a winkle afore yer opens 'er--I never see anything so peaceful.  'Ow dyer manage it? MRS. L.  Settin' 'ere and thenkin'. LEA.  Wot abaht? MRS. L.  We-el--Money, an' the works o' God. LEMMY.  Ah! So yer give me a thought sometimes. MRS. L.  [Lofting her mug]  Yu ought never to ha' spent yore money on this, Bob! LEMMY.  I thought that meself. MRS. L.  Last time I 'ad a glass o' port wine was the day yore brother Jim went to Ameriky.  [Smacking her lips]  For a teetotal drink, it du warm 'ee! LEMMY.  [Raising his mug]  Well, 'ere's to the British revolution! 'Ere's to the conflygrytion in the sky! MRS. L.  [Comfortably]  So as to kape up therr, 'twon't du no 'arm.      LEMMY goes to the window and unhooks his fiddle; he stands with      it halfway to his shoulder.  Suddenly he opens the window and      leans out.  A confused murmur of voices is heard; and a snatch      of the Marseillaise, sung by a girl.  Then the shuffling tramp      of feet, and figures are passing in the street. LEMMY.  [Turning--excited]  Wot'd I tell yer, old lydy?  There it is --there it is! MRS. L.  [Placidly]  What is? LEMMY.  The revolution.  [He cranes out]  They've got it on a barrer. Cheerio! VOICE.  [Answering]  Cheerio! LEMMY.  [Leaning out]  I sy--you 'yn't tykin' the body, are yer? VOICE.  Nao. LEMMY.  Did she die o' starvytion O.K.? VOICE.  She bloomin' well did; I know 'er brother. LEMMY.  Ah!  That'll do us a bit o' good! VOICE.  Cheerio! LEMMY.  So long! VOICE.  So long!      [The girl's voice is heard again in the distance singing the      Marseillaise.  The door is flung open and LITTLE AIDA comes      running in again.] LEMMY.  'Allo, little Aida! L. AIDA.  'Allo, I been follerin' the corfin.  It's better than an 'orse dahn! MRS. L.  What coffin? L. AIDA.  Why, 'er's wot died o' starvytion up the street.  They're goin' to tyke it to 'Yde Pawk, and 'oller. MRS. L.  Well, never yu mind wot they'm goin' to du: Yu wait an' take my trousers like a gude gell.      [She puts her mug aside and takes up her unfinished pair of      trousers.  But the wine has entered her fingers, and strength to      push the needle through is lacking.] LEMMY. [Tuning his fiddle] Wot'll yer 'ave, little Aida?  "Dead March in Saul" or "When the fields was white wiv dysies"? L. AIDA.  [With a hop and a brilliant smile]  Aoh yus!  "When the fields"---- MRS. L. [With a gesture of despair] Deary me!  I 'aven't a-got the strength! LEMMY.  Leave 'em alone, old dear!  No one'll be goin' aht wivaht trahsers to-night 'cos yer leaves that one undone.  Little Aida, fold 'em up!      [LITTLE AIDA methodically folds the five finished pairs of      trousers into a pile.  LEMMY begins playing.  A smile comes on      the face of MRS. L, who is rubbing her fingers.  LITTLE AIDA,      trousers over arm, goes and stares at LEMMY playing.] LEMMY.  [Stopping]  Little Aida, one o' vese dyes yer'll myke an actress.  I can see it in yer fyce!      [LITTLE AIDA looks at him wide-eyed.] MRS. L.  Don't 'ee putt things into 'er 'ead, Bob! LEMMY.  'Tyn't 'er 'ead, old lydy--it's lower.  She wants feedin'-- feed 'er an' she'll rise.  [He strikes into the "Machichi"]  Look at 'er naow.  I tell yer there's a fortune in 'er.      [LITTLE AIDA has put out her tongue.] MRS. L. I'd saner there was a gude 'eart in 'er than any fortune. L. AIDA. [Hugging her pile of trousers] It's thirteen pence three farthin's I've got to bring yer, an' a penny aht for me, mykes twelve three farthin's: [With the same little hop and sudden smile] I'm goin' to ride back on a bus, I am. LEMMY. Well, you myke the most of it up there; it's the nearest you'll ever git to 'eaven. MRS. L. Don' yu discourage 'er, Bob; she'm a gude little thing, an't yu, dear? L. AIDA. [Simply] Yus. LEMMY. Not 'arf. Wot c'her do wiv yesterdy's penny? L. AIDA. Movies. LEMMY. An' the dy before? L. AIDA. Movies. LEMMY. Wot'd I tell yer, old lydy--she's got vicious tystes, she'll finish in the theayter yep Tyke my tip, little Aida; you put every penny into yer foundytions, yer'll get on the boards quicker that wy. MRS. L. Don' yu pay no 'eed to his talk. L. AIDA. I daon't. Ice. Would yer like a sip aht o' my mug? L. AIDA. [Brilliant] Yus. MRS. L. Not at yore age, me dear, though it is teetotal.      [LITTLE AIDA puts her head on one side, like a dog trying to      understand.] LEMMY.  Well, 'ave one o' my gum-drops.      [Holds out a paper.]      [LITTLE AIDA brilliant, takes a flat, dark substance from it,      and puts it in her mouth.] Give me a kiss, an' I'll give yer a penny.      [LITTLE AIDA shakes her head, and leans out of window.] Movver, she daon't know the valyer of money. MRS. L. Never mind 'im, me dear. L. AIDA. [Sucking the gum-drop--with difficulty]  There's a taxi-cab at the corner.      [LITTLE AIDA runs to the door. A figure stands in the doorway;      she skids round him and out. THE PRESS comes in.] LEMMY.  [Dubiously]  Wat-oh! PRESS.  Mr. Lemmy? LEMMY.  The syme. PRESS.  I'm from the Press. LEMMY.  Blimy. PRESS.  They told me at your place you wens very likely here. LEMMY.  Yus I left Downin' Street a bit early to-dy!  [He twangs the feddle-strings pompously.] PRESS.  [Taking out his note-book and writing]  "Fiddles while Rome is burning!"  Mr. Lemmy, it's my business at this very critical time to find out what the nation's thinking.  Now, as a representative working man-- LEMMY.  That's me. PRESS.  You can help me.  What are your views? LEMMY.  [Putting down fiddle]  Voos?  Sit dahn!      [THE PRESS sits on the stool which LEMMY has vacated.] The Press--my Muvver.  Seventy-seven.  She's a wonder; 'yn't yer, old dear? PRESS.  Very happy to make your acquaintance, Ma'am.  [He writes] "Mrs. Lemmy, one of the veterans of industry----" By the way, I've jest passed a lot of people following a coffin. LEMMY.  Centre o' the cyclone--cyse o' starvytion; you 'ad 'er in the pyper this mornin'. PRESS.  Ah! yes!  Tragic occurrence.  [Looking at the trousers.]  Hub of the Sweated Industries just here.  I especially want to get at the heart---- MRS. L.  'Twasn't the 'eart, 'twas the stomach. PRESS.  [Writing]  "Mrs. Lemmy goes straight to the point." LEMMY. Mister, is it my voos or Muvver's yer want? PRESS.  Both. LEMMY.  'Cos if yer get Muvver's, yer won't 'ave time for mine.  I tell yer stryte [Confidentially]  she's get a glawss a' port wine in 'er.  Naow, mind yer, I'm not anxious to be intervooed.  On the other 'and, anyfink I might 'eve to sy of valyer----There is a clawss o' politician that 'as nuffn to sy--Aoh!  an' daon't 'e sy it just!  I dunno wot pyper yer represent. PRESS.  [Smiling]  Well, Mr. Lemmy, it has the biggest influ---- LEMMY.  They all 'as that; dylies, weeklies, evenin's, Sundyes; but it's of no consequence--my voos are open and aboveboard.  Naow, wot shall we begin abaht? PRESS.  Yourself, if you please.  And I'd like you to know at once that my paper wants the human note, the real heart-beat of things. LEMMY.  I see; sensytion!  Well; 'ere am I--a fustclawss plumber's. assistant--in a job to-dy an' out tomorrer.  There's a 'eart-beat in that, I tell yer.  'Oo knows wot the mower 'as for me! PRESS.  [Writing].  "The great human issue--Mr. Lemmy touches it at once." LEMMY.  I sy keep my nyme aht o' this; I don' go in fer self-advertisement. PRESS.  [Writing]  "True working-man--modest as usual." LEMMY.  I daon't want to embarrass the Gover'ment.  They're so ticklish ever since they got the 'abit, war-time, o' mindin' wot people said. PRESS.  Right-o! LEMMY.  For instance, suppose there's goin' to be a revolution---- [THE PRESS writes with energy.]  'Ow does it touch me?  Like this: I my go up--I cawn't come dahn; no more can Muvver. MRS. L. [Surprisingly] Us all goes down into the grave. PRESS.  "Mrs. Lemmy interjects the deeper note." LEMMY.  Naow, the gryte--they can come dahn, but they cawn't go up! See!  Put two an' two together, an' that's 'ow it touches me.  [He utters a throaty laugh]  'Ave yer got that? PRESS.  [Quizzical]  Not go up?  What about bombs, Mr. Lemmy? LEMMY.  [Dubious]  Wot abaht 'em?  I s'pose ye're on the comic pypers?  'Ave yer noticed wot a weakness they 'ave for the 'orrible? PRESS.  [Writing]  "A grim humour peeped out here and there through the earnestness of his talk."      [He sketches LEMMY'S profile.] LEMMY.  We 'ad an explosion in my factory time o' the war, that would just ha' done for you comics. [He meditates]  Lord!  They was after it too,--they an' the Sundyes; but the Censor did 'em.  Strike me, I could tell yer things! PRESS.  That's what I want, Mr. Lemmy; tell me things! LEMMY.  [Musing]  It's a funny world, 'yn't it?  'Ow we did blow each other up!  [Getting up to admire] I sy, I shall be syfe there.  That won't betry me anonymiety.  Why!  I looks like the Prime Minister! PRESS.  [Rather hurt]  You were going to tell me things. LEMMY.  Yus, an' they'll be the troof, too. PRESS.  I hope so; we don't---- LEMMY.  Wot oh! PRESS.  [A little confused.]  We always try to verify---- LEMMY.  Yer leave it at tryin', daon't yer?  Never, mind, ye're a gryte institootion.  Blimy, yer do have jokes, wiv it, spinnin' rahnd on yer own tyles, denyin' to-dy wot ye're goin' to print to-morrer. Ah, well!  Ye're like all of us below the line o' comfort--live dyngerously--ever' dy yer last.  That's wy I'm interested in the future. PRESS.  Well now--the future.  [Writing]  "He prophesies." LEMMY.  It's syfer, 'yn't it? [He winks]  No one never looks back on prophecies.  I remembers an editor spring o' 1916 stykin' his reputytion the war'd be over in the follerin' October.  Increased 'is circulytion abaht 'arf a million by it.  1917 an' war still on--'ad 'is readers gone back on 'im?  Nao!  They was increasin' like rabbits.  Prophesy wot people want to believe, an' ye're syfe.  Naow, I'll styke my reputation on somethin', you tyke it dahn word for word.  This country's goin' to the dawgs--Naow, 'ere's the sensytion--unless we gets a new religion. PRESS.  Ah! Now for it--yes? LEMMY.  In one word: "Kindness."  Daon't mistyke me, nao sickly sentiment and nao patronizin'.  Me as kind to the millionaire as 'im to me.  [Fills his mug and drinks.] PRESS.  [Struck]  That's queer!  Kindness!  [Writing]  "Extremes meet.  Bombed and bomber breathing the same music." LEMMY.  But 'ere's the interestin' pynt.  Can it be done wivaht blood? PRESS.  [Writing]  "He doubts." LEMMY.  No dabt wotever.  It cawn't!  Blood-and-kindness!  Spill the blood o' them that aren't kind--an' there ye are! PRESS.  But pardon me, how are you to tell? LEMMY.  Blimy, they leaps to the heye! PRESS.  [Laying down-his note-book]  I say, let me talk to you as man to man for a moment. LEMMY.  Orl right.  Give it a rest! PRESS.  Your sentiments are familiar to me.  I've got a friend on the Press who's very keen on Christ and kindness; and wants to strangle the last king with the--hamstrings of the last priest. LEMMY.  [Greatly intrigued]  Not 'arf!  Does 'e? PRESS.  Yes.  But have you thought it out?  Because he hasn't. LEMMY.  The difficulty is--where to stop. PRESS.  Where to begin. LEMMY.  Lawd!  I could begin almost anywhere.  Why, every month abaht, there's a cove turns me aht of a job 'cos I daon't do just wot 'e likes.  They'd 'ave to go.  I tell yer stryte--the Temple wants cleanin' up. PRESS.  Ye-es.  If I wrote what I thought, I should get the sack as quick as you.  D'you say that justifies me in shedding the blood of my boss? LEMMY.  The yaller Press 'as got no blood--'as it?  You shed their ile an' vinegar--that's wot you've got to do.  Stryte--do yer believe in the noble mission o' the Press? PRESS.  [Enigmatically]  Mr. Lemmy, I'm a Pressman. LEMMY.  [Goggling]  I see.  Not much!  [Gently jogging his mother's elbow]  Wyke up, old lydy!      [For Mrs. LEMMY who has been sipping placidly at her port, is      nodding.  The evening has drawn in.  LEMMY strikes a match on      his trousers and lights a candle.] Blood an' kindness-that's what's wanted--'specially blood!  The 'istory o' me an' my family'll show yer that.  Tyke my bruver Fred --crushed by burycrats.  Tyke Muvver 'erself.  Talk o' the wrongs o' the people!  I tell yer the foundytions is rotten.  [He empties the bottle into his mother's mug]  Daon't mind the mud at the bottom, old lydy--it's all strengthenin'!  You tell the Press, Muvver.  She can talk abaht the pawst. PRESS.  [Taking up his note-book, and becoming, again his professional self] Yes, Mrs. Lemmy?  "Age and Youth--Past and Present--" MRS. L.  Were yu talkin' about Fred?  [The port has warmed her veins, the colour in her eyes and cheeks has deepened]  My son Fred was always a gude boy--never did nothin' before 'e married.  I can see Fred [She bends forward a little in her chair, looking straight before her]  acomin' in wi' a pheasant 'e'd found--terrible 'e was at findin' pheasants.  When father died, an' yu was cumin', Bob, Fred 'e said to me: "Don't yu never cry, Mother, I'll look after 'ee."  An' so 'e did, till 'e married that day six months an' take to the drink in sower.  'E wasn't never 'the same boy again--not Fred.  An' now 'e's in That.  I can see poor Fred----      [She slowly wipes a tear out of the corner of an eye with the      back of her finger.] PRESS.  [Puzzled]  In--That? LEMMY.  [Sotto voce]  Come orf it!  Prison!  'S wot she calls it. MRS. L.  [Cheerful]  They say life's a vale o' sorrows.  Well, so 'tes, but don' du to let yureself thenk so. PRESS.  And so you came to London, Mrs. Lemmy? MRS. L.  Same year as father died.  With the four o' them--that's my son Fred, an' my son Jim, an' my son Tom, an' Alice.  Bob there, 'e was born in London--an' a praaper time I 'ad of et. PRESS.  [Writing]  "Her heroic struggles with poverty----" MRS. L.  Worked in a laundry, I ded, at fifteen shellin's a week, an' brought 'em all up on et till Alice 'ad the gallopin' consumption.  I can see poor Alice wi' the little red spots is 'er cheeks---an' I not knowin' wot to du wi' 'her--but I always kept up their buryin' money. Funerals is very dear; Mr. Lemmy was six pound, ten. PRESS.  "High price of Mr. Lemmy." MRS. L.  I've a-got the money for when my time come; never touch et, no matter 'ow things are.  Better a little goin' short here below, an' enter the kingdom of 'eaven independent: PRESS.  [Writing]  "Death before dishonour--heroine of the slums. Dickens--Betty Higden." MRS. L.  No, sir.  Mary Lemmy.  I've seen a-many die, I 'ave; an' not one grievin'.  I often says to meself: [With a little laugh]  "Me dear, when yu go, yu go 'appy.  Don' yu never fret about that," I says.  An' so I will; I'll go 'appy.      [She stays quite still a moment, and behind her LEMMY draws one      finger across his face.] [Smiling]  "Yore old fengers'll 'ave a rest.  Think o' that!" I says. "'Twill be a brave change."  I can see myself lyin' there an' duin' nothin'.      [Again a pause, while MRS. LEMMY sees herself doing nothing.] LEMMY.  Tell abaht Jim; old lydy. MRS. L.  My son Jim 'ad a family o' seven in six years.  "I don' know 'ow 'tes, Mother," 'e used to say to me; "they just sim to come!" That was Jim--never knu from day to day what was cumin'.  "Therr's another of 'em dead," 'e used to say, "'tes funny, tu"  "Well," I used to say to 'im; "no wonder, poor little things, livin' in they model dwellin's.  Therr's no air for 'em," I used to say.  "Well," 'e used to say, "what can I du, Mother?  Can't afford to live in Park Lane:" An' 'e take an' went to Ameriky.  [Her voice for the first time is truly doleful]  An' never came back.  Fine feller.  So that's my four sons--One's dead, an' one's in--That, an' one's in Ameriky, an' Bob 'ere, poor boy, 'e always was a talker.      [LEMMY, who has re-seated himself in the window and taken up his      fiddle, twangs the strings.] PRESS.  And now a few words about your work, Mrs. Lemmy? MRS. L.  Well, I sews. PRESS.  [Writing]  "Sews."  Yes? MRS. L.  [Holding up her unfinished pair of trousers]  I putt in the button'oles, I stretches the flies, I lines the crutch, I putt on this bindin', [She holds up the calico that binds the top]  I sews on the buttons, I press the seams--Tuppence three farthin's the pair. PRESS.  Twopence three farthings a pair!  Worse than a penny a line! MRS. L.  In a gude day I gets thru four pairs, but they'm gettin' plaguey 'ard for my old fengers. PRESS.  [Writing]  "A monumental figure, on whose labour is built the mighty edifice of our industrialism." LEMMY.  I sy--that's good.  Yer'll keep that, won't yet? MRS. L.  I finds me own cotton, tuppence three farthin's, and other expension is a penny three farthin's. PRESS.  And are you an exception, Mrs. Lemmy? MRS. L.  What's that? LEMMY.  Wot price the uvvers, old lydy?  Is there a lot of yer sewin' yer fingers orf at tuppence 'ypenny the pair? MRS. L.  I can't tell yu that.  I never sees nothin' in 'ere.  I pays a penny to that little gell to bring me a dozen pair an' fetch 'em back.  Poor little thing, she'm 'ardly strong enough to carry 'em. Feel!  They'm very 'eavy! PRESS.  On the conscience of Society! LEMMY.  I sy put that dahn, won't yer? PRESS.  Have things changed much since the war, Mrs.  Lemmy? MRS. L.  Cotton's a lot dearer. PRESS.  All round, I mean. MRS. L.  Aw!  Yu don' never get no change, not in my profession. [She oscillates the trousers]  I've a-been in trousers fifteen year; ever since I got to old for laundry. PRESS.  [Writing]  "For fifteen years sewn trousers."  What would a good week be, Mrs. Lemmy? MRS. L.  'Tes a very gude week, five shellin's. LEMMY.  [From the window]  Bloomin' millionairess, Muvver.  She's lookin' forward to 'eaven, where vey don't wear no trahsers. MRS.  L.  [With spirit] 'Tidn for me to zay whether they du.  An' 'tes on'y when I'm a bit low-sperrity-like as I wants to go therr. What I am a-lukin' forward to, though, 'tes a day in the country. I've not a-had one since before the war.  A kind lady brought me in that bit of 'eather; 'tes wonderful sweet stuff when the 'oney's in et.  When I was a little gell I used to zet in the 'eather gatherin' the whorts, an' me little mouth all black wi' eatin' them.  'Twas in the 'eather I used to zet, Sundays, courtin'.  All flesh is grass-- an' 'tesn't no bad thing--grass. PRESS.  [Writing]  "The old paganism of the country."  What is your view of life, Mrs. Lemmy? LEMMY.  [Suddenly]  Wot is 'er voo of life?  Shall I tell yer mine? Life's a disease--a blinkin' oak-apple!  Daon't myke no mistyke.  An' 'umen life's a yumourous disease; that's all the difference.  Why-- wot else can it be?  See the bloomin' promise an' the blighted performance--different as a 'eadline to the noos inside.  But yer couldn't myke Muvver see vat--not if yer talked to 'er for a wok. Muvver still believes in fings.  She's a country gell; at a 'undred and fifty she'll be a country gell, won't yer, old lydy? MRS. L.  Well, 'tesn't never been 'ome to me in London.  I lived in the country forty year--I did my lovin' there; I burried father therr.  Therr bain't nothin' in life, yu know, but a bit o' lovin'-- all said an' done; bit o' lovin', with the wind, an' the stars out. LEMMY.  [In a loud apologetic whisper]  She 'yn't often like this.  I told yer she'd got a glawss o' port in 'er. MRS. L.  'Tes a brave pleasure, is lovin'.  I likes to zee et in young folk.  I likes to zee 'em kissin'; shows the 'eart in 'em. 'Tes the 'eart makes the world go round; 'tesn't nothin' else, in my opinion. PRESS.  [Writing]  "--sings the swan song of the heart."---- MRS. L.  [Overhearing]  No, I never yeard a swan sing--never!  But I tell 'ee what I 'eve 'eard; the Bells singin' in th' orchard 'angin' up the clothes to dry, an' the cuckoos callin' back to 'em. [Smiling]  There's a-many songs in the country-the 'eart is freelike in th' country! LEMMY.  [Soto voce]  Gi' me the Strand at ar' past nine. PRESS. [Writing]  "Town and country----" MRS. L.  'Tidn't like that in London; one day's jest like another. Not but what therr's a 'eap o' kind'eartedness 'ere. LEMMY.  [Gloomily]  Kind-'eartedness!  I daon't fink "Boys an' Gells come out to play."      [He plays the old tune on his fiddle.] MRS. L.  [Singing]  "Boys an' Gells come out to play.  The mune is shinin' bright as day."  [She laughs]  I used to sing like a lark when I was a gell.      [LITTLE AIDA enters.] L. AIDA.  There's 'undreds follerin' the corfin.  'Yn't you goin', Mr. Lemmy--it's dahn your wy! LEMMY.  [Dubiously]  Well yus--I s'pose they'll miss me. L. AIDA.  Aoh!  Tyke me! PRESS.  What's this? LEMMY.  The revolution in 'Yde Pawk. PRESS.  [Struck]  In Hyde Park?  The very thing.  I'll take you down. My taxi's waiting. L. AIDA.  Yus; it's breathin' 'ard, at the corner. PRESS.  [Looking at his watch]  Ah! and Mrs. Lemmy.  There's an Anti-Sweating Meeting going on at a house in Park Lane.  We can get there in twenty minutes if we shove along.  I want you to tell them about the trouser-making.  You'll be a sensation! LEMMY.  [To himself]  Sensytion!  'E cawn't keep orf it! MRS. L.  Anti-Sweat.  Poor fellers!  I 'ad one come to see we before the war, an' they'm still goin' on?  Wonderful, an't it? PRESS.  Come, Mrs. Lemmy; drive in a taxi, beautiful moonlit night; and they'll give you a splendid cup of tea. MRS. L.  [Unmoved]  Ah! I cudn't never du without my tea.  There's not an avenin' but I thinks to meself: Now, me dear, yu've a-got one more to fennish, an' then yu'll 'eve yore cup o' tea.  Thank you for callin', all the same. LEMMY.  Better siccumb to the temptytion, old lydy; joyride wiv the Press; marble floors, pillars o' gold; conscientious footmen; lovely lydies; scuppers runnin' tea!  An' the revolution goin' on across the wy.  'Eaven's nuffink to Pawk Lyne. PRESS.  Come along, Mrs. Lemmy! MRS. L.  [Seraphically]  Thank yu,--I'm a-feelin' very comfortable. 'Tes wonderful what a drop o' wine'll du for the stomach. PRESS.  A taxi-ride! MRS. L.  [Placidly]  Ah! I know'em.  They'm very busy things. LEMMY.  Muvver shuns notority.  [Sotto voce to THE PRESS]  But you watch me!  I'll rouse 'er.      [He takes up his fiddle and sits on the window seat.  Above the      little houses on the opposite side of the street, the moon has      risen in the dark blue sky, so that the cloud shaped like a      beast seems leaping over it.  LEMMY plays the first notes of the      Marseillaise.  A black cat on the window-sill outside looks in,      hunching its back.  LITTLE AIDA barks at her.  MRS. LEMMY      struggles to her feet, sweeping the empty dish and spoon to the      floor in the effort.] The dish ran awy wiv the spoon!  That's right, old lydy!  [He stops playing.] MRS. L.  [Smiling, and moving her hands]  I like a bit o' music.  It du that move 'ee. PRESS.  Bravo, Mrs. Lemmy.  Come on! LEMMY.  Come on, old dear!  We'll be in time for the revolution yet. MRS. L.  'Tes 'earin' the Old 'Undred again! LEMMY.  [To THE PRESS]  She 'yn't been aht these two years.  [To his mother, who has put up her hands to her head]  Nao, never mind yer 'at.  [To THE PRESS]  She 'yn't got none!  [Aloud]  No West-End lydy wears anyfink at all in the evenin'! MRS. L.  'Ow'm I lukin', Bob? LEMMY.  First-clawss; yer've got a colour fit to toast by.  We'll show 'em yer've got a kick in yer.  [He takes her arm]  Little Aida, ketch 'old o' the sensytions.      [He indicates the trousers THE PRESS takes MRS. LEMMY'S other      arm.] MRS. L.  [With an excited little laugh]  Quite like a gell! And, smiling between her son and THE PRESS, she passes out; LITTLE AIDA, with a fling of her heels and a wave of the trousers, follows.                               CURTAIN ACT III      An octagon ante-room of the hall at LORD WILLIAM DROMONDY'S.      A shining room lighted by gold candelabra, with gold-curtained      pillars, through which the shining hall and a little of the      grand stairway are visible.  A small table with a gold-coloured      cloth occupies the very centre of the room, which has a polished      parquet floor and high white walls.  Gold-coloured doors on the      left.  Opposite these doors a window with gold-coloured curtains      looks out on Park Lane.  LADY WILLIAM standing restlessly      between the double doors and the arch which leads to the hall.      JAMES is stationary by the double doors, from behind which come      sounds of speech and applause. POULDER.  [Entering from the hall]  His Grace the Duke of Exeter, my lady.      [His GRACE enters.  He is old, and youthful, with a high colour      and a short rough white beard.  LADY WILLIAM advances to meet      him.  POULDER stands by.] LADY W.  Oh!  Father, you ARE late. HIS G.  Awful crowd in the streets, Nell.  They've got a coffin-- couldn't get by. LADY W.  Coin?  Whose? HIS G.  The Government's I should think-no flowers, by request.  I say, have I got to speak? LADY W.  Oh!  no, dear. HIS G.  H'm!  That's unlucky.  I've got it here.  [He looks down his cuff]  Found something I said in 1914--just have done. LADY W.  Oh! If you've got it--James, ask Lord William to come to me for a moment.  [JAMES vanishes through the door.  To THE DUKE] Go in, Grand-dad; they'll be so awfully pleased to see you.  I'll tell Bill. HIS G.  Where's Anne? LADY W.  In bed, of course. HIS G.  I got her this--rather nice?      [He has taken from his breast-pocket one of those street toy-men      that jump head over heels on your hand; he puts it through its      paces.] LADY W.  [Much interested]  Oh!  no, but how sweet!  She'll simply love it. POULDER.  If I might suggest to Your Grace to take it in and operate it.  It's sweated, Your Grace.  They-er-make them in those places. HIS G.  By Jove!  D'you know the price, Poulder? POULDER.  [Interrogatively]  A penny, is it?  Something paltry, Your Grace! HIS G.  Where's that woman who knows everything; Miss Munday? LADY W.  Oh!  She'll be in there, somewhere.      [His GRACE moves on, and passes through the doors.  The sound of      applause is heard.] POULDER.  [Discreetly]  would you care to see the bomb, my lady? LADY W.  Of course--first quiet moment. POULDER.  I'll bring it up, and have a watch put on it here, my lady.      [LORD WILLIAM comes through the double doom followed by JAMES.      POULDER retires.] LORD W.  Can't you come, Nell? LADY W.  Oh!  Bill, your Dad wants to speak. LORD W.  The deuce he does--that's bad. LADY W.  Yes, of course, but you must let him; he's found something he said in 1914. LORD W.  I knew it.  That's what they'll say.  Standing stock still, while hell's on the jump around us. LADY W.  Never mind that; it'll please him; and he's got a lovely little sweated toy that turns head over heels at one penny. LORD W.  H'm!  Well, come on. LADY W.  No, I must wait for stragglers.  There's sure to be an editor in a hurry. POULDER.  [Announcing]  Mis-ter Gold-rum! LADY W. [Sotto voce]  And there he is!  [She advances to meet a thin, straggling man in eyeglasses, who is smiling absently]  How good of you! MR. G.  Thanks awfully.  I just er--and then I'm afraid I must--er-- Things look very----Thanks----Thanks so much.      [He straggles through the doors, and is enclosed by JAMES.] POULDER.  Miss Mun-day. LORD W.  There!  I thought she was in--She really is the most unexpected woman!  How do you do?  How awfully sweet of you! MISS M.  [An elderly female schoolboy]  How do you do?  There's a spiffing crowd.  I believe things are really going Bolshy.  How do you do, Lord William?  Have you got any of our people to show?  I told one or two, in case--they do so simply love an outing. JAMES.  There are three old chips in the lobby, my Lord. LORD W.  What?  Oh!  I say!  Bring them in at once.  Why--they're the hub of the whole thing. JAMES.  [Going]  Very good, my Lord. LADY W.  I am sorry.  I'd no notion; and they're such dears always. MISS M.  I must tell you what one of them said to me.  I'd told him not to use such bad language to his wife.  "Don't you worry, Ma!" he said, "I expert you can do a bit of that yourself!" LADY W.  How awfully nice!  It's SO like them. MISS M.  Yes.  They're wonderful. LORD W.  I say, why do we always call them they? LADY W.  [Puzzled]  Well, why not? LORD W.  THEY! MISS M.  [Struck]  Quite right, Lord William!  Quite right!  Another species.  They!  I must remember that.  THEY! [She passes on.] LADY W.  [About to follow]  Well, I don't see; aren't they? LORD W.  Never mind, old girl; follow on.  They'll come in with me.      [MISS MUNDAY and LADY WILLIAM pass through the double doors.] POULDER.  [Announcing]  Some sweated workers, my Lord.      [There enter a tall, thin, oldish woman; a short, thin, very      lame man, her husband; and a stoutish middle-aged woman with a      rolling eye and gait, all very poorly dressed, with lined and      heated faces.] LORD W.  [Shaking hands]  How d'you do!  Delighted to see you all. It's awfully good of you to have come. LAME M.  Mr. and Mrs. Tomson.  We 'ad some trouble to find it.  You see, I've never been in these parts.  We 'ad to come in the oven; and the bus-bloke put us dahn wrong.  Are you the proprietor? LORD W.  [Modestly]  Yes, I--er-- LAME M.  You've got a nice plyce.  I says to the missis, I says: "'E's got a nice plyce 'ere," I says; "there's room to turn rahnd." LORD W.  Yes--shall we--? LAME M.  An' Mrs. Annaway she says: "Shouldn't mind livin 'ere meself," she says; "but it must cost'im a tidy penny," she says. LORD W.  It does--it does; much too tidy.  Shall we--? MRS. ANN.  [Rolling her eye]  I'm very pleased to 'ave come.  I've often said to 'em: "Any time you want me," I've said, "I'd be pleased to come." LORD W.  Not so pleased as we are to see you. MRS. ANN.  I'm sure you're very kind. JAMES.  [From the double doors, through which he has received a message]  Wanted for your speech, my Lord. LORD W.  Oh!  God!  Poulder, bring these ladies and gentleman in, and put them where everybody can--where they can see everybody, don't you know.      [He goes out hurriedly through the double doors.] LAME M.  Is 'e a lord? POULDER.  He is.  Follow me.      [He moves towards the doors, the three workers follow.] MRS. ANN.  [Stopping before JAMES]  You 'yn't one, I suppose? [JAMES stirs no muscle.] POULDER.  Now please.  [He opens the doors.  The Voice of LORD WILLIAM speaking is heard]  Pass in.      [THE THREE WORKERS pass in, POULDER and JAMES follow them.  The      doors are not closed, and through this aperture comes the voice      of LORD WILLIAM, punctuated and supported by decorous applause.]      [LITTLE ANNE runs in, and listens at the window to the confused      and distant murmurs of a crowd.] VOICE OF LORD W.  We propose to move for a further advance in the chain-making and--er--er--match-box industries.  [Applause.]      [LITTLE ANNE runs across to the door, to listen.] [On rising voice]  I would conclude with some general remarks. Ladies and gentlemen, the great natural, but--er--artificial expansion which trade experienced the first years after the war has-- er--collapsed.  These are hard times.  We who are fortunate feel more than ever--er--responsible--[He stammers, loses the thread of his thoughts.]--[Applause]--er--responsible--[The thread still eludes him]--er---- L. ANNE.  [Poignantly]  Oh, Daddy! LORD W.  [Desperately]  In fact--er--you know how--er--responsible we feel. L. ANNE.  Hooray!  [Applause.]      [There float in through the windows the hoarse and distant      sounds of the Marseillaise, as sung by London voices.] LORD W.  There is a feeling in the air--that I for one should say deliberately was--er--a feeling in the air--er--a feeling in the air---- L. ANNE.  [Agonised]  Oh, Daddy!  Stop!      [Jane enters, and closes the door behind him.  JAMES.  Look      here!  'Ave I got to report you to Miss Stokes?] L. ANNE.  No-o-o! JAMES.  Well, I'm goin' to. L. ANNE.  Oh, James, be a friend to me!  I've seen nothing yet. JAMES.  No; but you've eaten a good bit, on the stairs.  What price that Peach Melba? L. ANNE.  I can't go to bed till I've digested it can I?  There's such a lovely crowd in the street! JAMES.  Lovely?  Ho! L. ANNE.  [Wheedling]  James, you couldn't tell Miss Stokes!  It isn't in you, is it? JAMES.  [Grinning]  That's right. L. ANNE.  So-I'll just get under here.  [She gets under the table] Do I show? JAMES.  [Stooping]  Not 'arf!      [POULDER enters from the hall.] POULDER.  What are you doin' there? JAMES. [Between him and the table--raising himself]  Thinkin'.      [POULDER purses his mouth to repress his feedings.] POULDER.  My orders are to fetch the bomb up here for Lady William to inspect.  Take care no more writers stray in. JAMES.  How shall I know 'em? POULDER.  Well--either very bald or very hairy. JAMES.  Right-o!  [He goes.]      [POULDER, with his back to the table, busies himself with the      set of his collar.] POULDER. [Addressing an imaginary audience--in a low but important voice]  The--ah--situation is seerious.  It is up to us of the--ah-- leisured classes----      [The face of LITTLE ANNE is poked out close to his legs, and      tilts upwards in wonder towards the bow of his waistcoat.] to--ah--keep the people down.  The olla polloi are clamourin'----      [Miss STOKES appears from the hall, between the pillars.] Miss S. Poulder! POULDER.  [Making a volte face towards the table] Miss? MISS S.  Where is Anne? POULDER.  [Vexed at the disturbance of his speech]  Excuse me, Miss-- to keep track of Miss Anne is fortunately no part of my dooties.      [Miss S.  She really is naughty.] POULDER.  She is.  If she was mine, I'd spank her.      [The smiling face of LITTLE ANNE becomes visible again close to      his legs.] MISS S.  Not a nice word. POULDER.  No; but a pleasant haction.  Miss Anne's the limit.  In fact, Lord and Lady William are much too kind 'earted all round. Take these sweated workers; that class o' people are quite 'opeless. Treatin' them as your equals, shakin 'ands with 'em, givin 'em tea-- it only puffs 'em out.  Leave it to the Church, I say. MISS S.  The Church is too busy, Poulder. POULDER.  Ah!  That "Purity an' Future o' the Race Campaign."  I'll tell you what I thinks the danger o' that, Miss.  So much purity that there won't be a future race.  [Expanding]  Purity of 'eart's an excellent thing, no doubt, but there's a want of nature about it. Same with this Anti-Sweating.  Unless you're anxious to come down, you must not put the lower classes up. MISS S.  I don't agree with you at all, Poulder. POULDER.  Ah!  You want it both ways, Miss.  I should imagine you're a Liberal. MISS S.  [Horrified]  Oh, no!  I certainly am not. POULDER.  Well, I judged from your takin' cocoa.  Funny thing that, about cocoa-how it still runs through the Liberal Party!  It's virtuous, I suppose.  Wine, beer, tea, coffee-all of 'em vices.  But cocoa you might drink a gallon a day and annoy no one but yourself! There's a lot o' deep things in life, Miss! Miss S.  Quite so.  But I must find Anne.      [She recedes. ] POULDER.  [Suavely]  Well, I wish you every success; and I hope you'll spank her.  This modern education--there's no fruitiness in it. L. ANNE.  [From under the table]  Poulder, are you virtuous? POULDER.  [Jumping]  Good Ged! L. ANNE.  D'you mind my asking?  I promised James I would. POULDER.  Miss Anne, come out!      [The four footmen appear in the hall, HENRY carrying the wine      cooler.] JAMES.  Form fours-by your right-quick march!      [They enter, marching down right of table.] Right incline--Mark time!  Left turn!  'Alt!  'Enry, set the bomb! Stand easy!      [HENRY places the wine cooler on the table and covers it with a      blue embroidered Chinese mat, which has occupied the centre of      the tablecloth.] POULDER.  Ah!  You will 'ave your game!  Thomas, take the door there! James, the 'all!  Admit titles an' bishops.  No literary or Labour people.  Charles and 'Enry, 'op it and 'ang about!      [CHARLES and HENRY go out, the other too move to their      stations.]      [POULDER, stands by the table looking at the covered bomb.  The      hoarse and distant sounds of the Marseillaise float in again      from Park Lane.] [Moved by some deep feeling]  And this house an 'orspital in the war! I ask you--what was the good of all our sacrifices for the country? No town 'ouse for four seasons--rustygettin' in the shires, not a soul but two boys under me.  Lord William at the front, Lady William at the back.  And all for this!  [He points sadly at the cooler]  It comes of meddlin' on the Continent.  I had my prognostications at the time.  [To JAMES]  You remember my sayin' to you just before you joined up: "Mark my words--we shall see eight per cent. for our money before this is over!" JAMES.  [Sepulchrally]  I see the eight per cent., but not the money. POULDER.  Hark at that!      [The sounds of the Marseillaise grow louder.  He shakes his      head.] I'd read the Riot Act.  They'll be lootin' this house next! JAMES.  We'll put up a fight over your body: "Bartholomew Poulder, faithful unto death!"  Have you insured your life? POULDER.  Against a revolution? JAMES.  Act o' God!  Why not? POULDER.  It's not an act o' God. JAMES.  It is; and I sympathise with it. POULDER.  You--what? JAMES.  I do--only--hands off the gov'nor. POULDER.  Oh!  Really!  Well, that's something.  I'm glad to see you stand behind him, at all events. JAMES.  I stand in front of 'im when the scrap begins! POULDER.  Do you insinuate that my heart's not in the right place? JAMES.  Well, look at it!  It's been creepin' down ever since I knew you.  Talk of your sacrifices in the war--they put you on your honour, and you got stout on it.  Rations--not 'arf. POULDER.  [Staring at him]  For independence, I've never seen your equal, James.  You might be an Australian. JAMES.  [Suavely]  Keep a civil tongue, or I'll throw you to the crowd!  [He comes forward to the table]  Shall I tell you why I favour the gov'nor?  Because, with all his pomp, he's a gentleman, as much as I am.  Never asks you to do what he wouldn't do himself. What's more, he never comes it over you.  If you get drunk, or--well, you understand me, Poulder--he'll just say: "Yes, yes; I know, James!" till he makes you feel he's done it himself.  [Sinking his voice mysteriously] I've had experience with him, in the war and out. Why he didn't even hate the Huns, not as he ought.  I tell you he's no Christian. POULDER.  Well, for irreverence----! JAMES.  [Obstinately]  And he'll never be.  He's got too soft a heart. L. ANNE.  [Beneath the table-shrilly] Hurrah! POULDER.  [Jumping]  Come out, Miss Anne! JAMES.  Let 'er alone! POULDER.  In there, under the bomb? JAMES.  [Contemptuously]  Silly ass!  You should take 'em lying down! POULDER.  Look here, James!  I can't go on in this revolutionary spirit; either you or I resign. JAMES.  Crisis in the Cabinet! POULDER.  I give you your marchin' orders. JAMES.  [Ineffably] What's that you give me? POULDER.  Thomas, remove James!      [THOMAS grins.] L. ANNE.  [Who, with open mouth, has crept out to see the fun]  Oh! Do remove James, Thomas! POULDER.  Go on, Thomas.      [THOMAS takes one step towards JAMES, who lays a hand on the      Chinese mat covering the bomb.] JAMES.  [Grimly]  If I lose control of meself. L. ANNE.  [Clapping her hands]  Oh!  James!  Do lose control!  Then I shall see it go off! JAMES.  [To POULDER]  Well, I'll merely empty the pail over you! POULDER.  This is not becomin'!      [He walks out into the hall.] JAMES.  Another strategic victory!  What a Boche he'd have made.  As you were, Tommy!      [THOMAS returns to the door.  The sound of prolonged applause      cornea from within.] That's a bishop. L. ANNE.  Why? JAMES.  By the way he's drawin'.  It's the fine fightin' spirit in 'em.  They were the backbone o' the war.  I see there's a bit o' the old stuff left in you, Tommy. L. ANNE.  [Scrutinizing the widely--grinning THOM]  Where?  Is it in his mouth? JAMES.  You've still got a sense of your superiors.  Didn't you notice how you moved to Poulder's orders, me boy; an' when he was gone, to mine? L. ANNE.  [To THOMAS]  March!      [The grinning THOMAS remains immovable.] He doesn't, James! JAMES.  Look here, Miss Anne--your lights ought to be out before ten. Close in, Tommy!      [He and THOMAS move towards her.] L. ANNE.  [Dodging]  Oh, no!  Oh, no!  Look!      [The footmen stop and turn.  There between the pillars, stands      LITTLE AIDA with the trousers, her face brilliant With      surprise.] JAMES.  Good Lord!  What's this?      [Seeing L. ANNE, LITTLE AIDA approaches, fascinated, and the two      children sniff at each other as it were like two little dogs      walking round and round.] L. ANNE.  [Suddenly]  My name's Anne; what's yours? L. AIDA.  Aida. L. ANNE.  Are you lost? L. AIDA.  Nao. L. ANNE.  Are those trousers? L. AIDA.  Yus. L. Arms.  Whose? L. AIDA.  Mrs. Lemmy's. L. ANNE.  Does she wear them?      [LITTLE AIDA smiles brilliantly.] L. AIDA.  Nao.  She sews 'em. L. ANNE.  [Touching the trousers]  They are hard.  James's are much softer; aren't they, James?  [JAMES deigns no reply]  What shall we do?  Would you like to see my bedroom? L. AIDA.  [With a hop]  Aoh, yus! JAMES.  No. L. ANNE.  Why not? JAMES.  Have some sense of what's fittin'. L. ANNE.  Why isn't it fittin'?  [To LITTLE AIDA]  Do you like me? L. AIDA.  Yus-s. L. ANNE.  So do I.  Come on!      [She takes LITTLE AIDA'S hand.] JAMES.  [Between the pillars]  Tommy, ketch 'em!      [THOMAS retains them by the skirts.] L. ANNE.  [Feigning indifference]  All right, then!  [To LITTLE AIDA] Have you ever seen a bomb? L. AIDA.  Nao. L. ANNE.  [Going to the table and lifting a corner of the cover] Look! L. AIDA.  [Looking]  What's it for? L. ANNE.  To blow up this house. L. AIDA.  I daon't fink! L. ANNE.  Why not? L. AIDA.  It's a beautiful big 'Ouse. L. ANNE.  That's why.  Isn't it, James? L. AIDA.  You give the fing to me; I'll blow up our 'ouse--it's an ugly little 'ouse. L. ANNE  [Struck]  Let's all blow up our own; then we can start fair. Daddy would like that. L. AIDA.  Yus.  [Suddenly brilliant]  I've 'ad a ride in a taxi, an' we're goin' 'ome in it agyne! L. ANNE.  Were you sick? LITTLE AIDA.  [Brilliant]  Nao. L. ANNE I was; when I first went in one, but I was quite young then. James, could you get her a Peche Melba?  There was one. JAMES.  No. L. ANNE.  Have you seen the revolution? L. AIDA.  Wot's that? L. ANNE.  It's made of people. L. AIDA.  I've seen the corfin, it's myde o' wood. L. ANNE.  Do you hate the rich? L. AIDA.  [Ineffably]  Nao.  I hates the poor. L. ANNE.  Why? L. AIDA.  'Cos they 'yn't got nuffin'. L. ANNE.  I love the poor.  They're such dears. L. AIDA.  [Shaking her head with a broad smile]  Nao. L. ANNE.  Why not? L. AIDA.  I'd tyke and lose the lot, I would. L. ANNE.  Where? L. AIDA.  In the water. L. ANNE.  Like puppies? L. AIDA.  Yus. L. ANNE.  Why? L. AIDA.  Then I'd be shut of 'em. L. ANNE.  [Puzzled]  Oh!      [The voice of THE PRESS is heard in the hall.  "Where's the      little girl?"] JAMES.  That's you.  Come 'ere!      [He puts a hand behind LITTLE AIDA'S back and propels her      towards the hall.  THE PRESS enters with old MRS. LEMMY.] PRESS.  Oh!  Here she is, major domo.  I'm going to take this old lady to the meeting; they want her on the platform.  Look after our friend, Mr. Lemmy here; Lord William wants to see him presently. L. ANNE.  [In an awed whisper]  James, it's the little blighter!      [She dives again under the table.  LEMMY enters.] LEMMY.  'Ere!  'Arf a mo'!  Yer said yer'd drop me at my plyce. Well, I tell yer candid--this 'yn't my plyce. PRESS.  That's all right, Mr. Lemmy.  [He grins]  They'll make you wonderfully comfortable, won't you, major domo?      [He passes on through the room, to the door, ushering old MRS.      LEMMY and LITTLE AIDA.]      [POULDER blocks LEMMY'S way, with CHARLES and HENRY behind him.] POULDER.  James, watch it; I'll report.      [He moves away, following THE PRESS through the door.  JAMES      between table and window.  THOMAS has gone to the door.  HENRY      and CHARLES remain at the entrances to the hall.  LEMMY looks      dubiously around, his cockney assurrance gradually returns.] LEMMY.  I think I knows the gas 'ere.  This is where I came to-dy, 'yn't it?  Excuse my hesitytion--these little 'ouses IS so much the syme. JAMES.  [Gloomily]  They are! LEMMY.  [Looking at the four immovable footmen, till he concentrates on JAMES]  Ah! I 'ad a word wiv you, 'adn't I?  You're the four conscientious ones wot's wyin' on your gov'nor's chest.  'Twas you I spoke to, wasn't it?  [His eyes travel over them again]  Ye're so monotonous.  Well, ye're busy now, I see.  I won't wyste yer time.      [He turns towards the hall, but CHARLES and HENRY bar the way in      silence.]      [Skidding a little, and regarding the four immovables once more] I never see such pytient men?  Compared wiv yer, mountains is restless.      [He goes to the table.  JAMES watches him.  ANNE barks from      underneath.] [Skidding again]  Why!  There's a dawg under there.  [Noting the grin on THOMAS'S face]  Glad it amooses yer.  Yer want it, daon't yer, wiv a fyce like that?  Is this a ply wivaht words?  'Ave I got into the movies by mistyke?  Turn aht, an' let's 'ave six penn'orth o' darkness. L. ANNE.  [From beneath the cable]  No, no!  Not dark! LEMMY.  [Musingly]  The dawg talks anywy.  Come aht, Fido!      [LITTLE ANNE emerges, and regards him with burning curiosity.] I sy: Is this the lytest fashion o' receivin' guests? L. ANNE.  Mother always wants people to feel at home.  What shall we do?  Would you like to hear the speeches?  Thomas, open the door a little, do! JAMES.  'Umour 'er a couple o' inches, Tommy!      [THOMAS draws the door back stealthily an inch or so.] L. ANNE.  [After applying her eye-in a loud whisper]  There's the old lady.  Daddy's looking at her trousers.  Listen!      [For MRS. LEMMY'S voice is floating faintly through: "I putt in      the buttonholes, I stretches the flies; I 'ems the bottoms; I      lines the crutch; I putt on this bindin'; I sews on the buttons;      I presses the seams--Tuppence three farthin's the pair."] LEMMY.  [In a hoarse whisper]  That's it, old lydy: give it 'em! L. ANNE.  Listen! VOICE OF LORD W.  We are indebted to our friends the Press for giving us the pleasure--er--pleasure of hearing from her own lips--the pleasure---- L. ANNE.  Oh!  Daddy!      [THOMAS abruptly closes the doors.] LEMMY.  [To ANNE]  Now yer've done it.  See wot comes o' bein' impytient.  We was just gettin' to the marrer. L. ANNE.  What can we do for you now? LEMMY.  [Pointing to ANNE, and addressing JAMES]  Wot is this one, anywy? JAMES.  [Sepulchrally]  Daughter o' the house. LEMMY.  Is she insured agynst 'er own curiosity? L. ANNE.  Why? LEMMY.  As I daon't believe in a life beyond the gryve, I might be tempted to send yer there. L. ANNE.  What is the gryve? LEMMY.  Where little gells goes to. L. ANNE.  Oh, when? LEMMY.  [Pretending to look at a match, which is not there]  Well, I dunno if I've got time to finish yer this minute.  Sy to-mower at. 'arf past. L. ANNE.  Half past what? LEMMY.  [Despairingly]  'Arf past wot!      [The sound of applause is heard.] JAMES.  That's 'is Grace.  'E's gettin' wickets, too.      [POULDER entering from the door.] POULDER.  Lord William is slippin' in.      [He makes a cabalistic sign with his head.  Jeers crosses to the      door.  LEMMY looks dubiously at POULDER.] LEMMY.  [Suddenly--as to himself]  Wot oh!  I am the portly one! POULDER.  [Severely]  Any such allusion aggeravates your offence. LEMMY.  Oh, ah!  Look 'ere, it was a corked bottle.  Now, tyke care, tyke care, 'aughty!  Daon't curl yer lip!  I shall myke a clean breast o' my betryal when the time comes!      [There is a alight movement of the door.  ANNE makes a dive      towards the table but is arrested by POULDER grasping her      waistband.  LORD WILLIAM slips in, followed by THE PRESS, on      whom JAMES and THOMAS close the door too soon.] HALF OF THE PRESS.  [Indignantly]  Look out! JAMES.  Do you want him in or out, me Lord? LEMMY.  I sy, you've divided the Press; 'e was unanimous.      [The FOOTMEN let THE PRESS through.] LORD W.  [To THE PRESS]  I'm so sorry. LEMMY.  Would yer like me to see to 'is gas? LORD W.  So you're my friend of the cellars? LEMMY.  [Uneasy]  I daon't deny it.      [POULDER begins removing LITTLE ANNE.] L. ANNE.  Let me stay, Daddy; I haven't seen anything yet!  If I go, I shall only have to come down again when they loot the house. Listen!      [The hoarse strains of the Marseillaise are again heard from the      distance.] LORD W.  [Blandly]  Take her up, Poulder! L. ANNE.  Well, I'm coming down again--and next time I shan't have any clothes on, you know.      [They vanish between the pillars.  LORD WILLIAM makes a sign of      dismissal.  The FOOTMAN file out.] LEMMY.  [Admiringly]  Luv'ly pyces! LORD W.  [Pleasantly]  Now then; let's have our talk, Mr.---- LEMMY.  Lemmy. PRESS.  [Who has slipped his note-book out]  "Bombed and Bomber face to face----" LEMMY. [Uneasy]  I didn't come 'ere agyne on me own, yer know.  The Press betryed me. LORD W.  Is that old lady your mother? LEMMY.  The syme.  I tell yer stryte, it was for 'er I took that old bottle o' port.  It was orful old. LORD W.  Ah!  Port?  Probably the '83.  Hope you both enjoyed it. LEMMY. So far-yus.  Muvver'll suffer a bit tomower, I expect. LORD W.  I should like to do something for your mother, if you'll allow me. LEMMY.  Oh!  I'll allow yer.  But I dunno wot she'll sy. LORD W.  I can see she's a fine independent old lady!  But suppose you were to pay her ten bob a week, and keep my name out of it? LEMMY.  Well, that's one wy o' YOU doin' somefink, 'yn't it? LORD W.  I giving you the money, of course. PRESS.  [Writing] "Lord William, with kingly generosity----" LEMMY.  [Drawing attention to THE PRESS with his thumb] I sy-- I daon't mind, meself--if you daon't---- LORD W.  He won't write anything to annoy me. PRESS.  This is the big thing, Lord William; it'll get the public bang in the throat. LEMMY.  [Confidentially]  Bit dyngerous, 'yn't it? trustin' the Press?  Their right 'ands never knows wot their left 'ands is writin'.  [To THE PRESS]  'Yn't that true, speakin' as a man? PRESS.  Mr. Lemmy, even the Press is capable of gratitude. LEMMY.  Is it?  I should ha' thought it was too important for a little thing like that.  [To LORD WILLIAM]  But ye're quite right; we couldn't do wivaht the Press--there wouldn't be no distress, no coffin, no revolution--'cos nobody'd know nuffin' abaht it.  Why! There wouldn't be no life at all on Earf in these dyes, wivaht the Press!  It's them wot says: "Let there be Light--an' there is Light." LORD W.  Umm!  That's rather a new thought to me.  [Writes on his cuff.] LEMMY.  But abaht Muvver, I'll tell yer 'ow we can arrynge.  You send 'er the ten bob a week wivaht syin' anyfink, an' she'll fink it comes from Gawd or the Gover'ment yer cawn't tell one from t'other in Befnal Green. LORD W.  All right; we'll' do that. LEMMY.  Will yer reely?  I'd like to shyke yer 'and.      [LORD WILLIAM puts out his hand, which LEMMY grasps.] PRESS.  [Writing]  "The heartbeat of humanity was in that grasp between the son of toil and the son of leisure." LEMMY.  [Already ashamed of his emotion]  'Ere, 'arf a mo'!  Which is which?  Daon't forget I'm aht o' wori; Lord William, if that's 'is nyme, is workin 'ard at 'is Anti-Sweats!  Wish I could get a job like vat--jist suit me! LORD W.  That hits hard, Mr. Lemmy. LEMMY.  Daon't worry!  Yer cawn't 'elp bein' born in the purple! LORD W.  Ah!  Tell me, what would you do in my place? LEMMY.  Why--as the nobleman said in 'is well-known wy: "Sit in me Club winder an' watch it ryne on the dam people!"  That's if I was a average nobleman!  If I was a bit more noble, I might be tempted to come the kind'earted on twenty thou' a year.  Some prefers yachts, or ryce 'orses.  But philanthropy on the 'ole is syfer, in these dyes. LORD W.  So you think one takes to it as a sort of insurance, Mr. Lemmy?  Is that quite fair? LEMMY.  Well, we've all got a weakness towards bein' kind, somewhere abaht us.  But the moment wealf comes in, we 'yn't wot I call single-'earted.  If yer went into the foundytions of your wealf--would yer feel like 'avin' any?  It all comes from uvver people's 'ard, unpleasant lybour--it's all built on Muvver as yer might sy.  An' if yer daon't get rid o' some of it in bein' kind--yer daon't feel syfe nor comfy. LORD W.  [Twisting his moustache] Your philosophy is very pessimistic. LEMMY.  Well, I calls meself an optimist; I sees the worst of everyfink.  Never disappynted, can afford to 'ave me smile under the blackest sky.  When deaf is squeezin' of me windpipe, I shall 'ave a laugh in it!  Fact is, if yer've 'ad to do wiv gas an' water pipes, yer can fyce anyfing.  [The distant Marseillaise blares up] 'Ark at the revolution! LORD W.  [Rather desperately]  I know--hunger and all the rest of it! And here am I, a rich man, and don't know what the deuce to do. LEMMY.  Well, I'll tell yer.  Throw yer cellars open, an' while the populyce is gettin' drunk, sell all yer 'ave an' go an' live in Ireland; they've got the millennium chronic over there.      [LORD WILLIAM utters a short, vexed laugh, and begins to walk      about.] That's speakin' as a practical man.  Speakin' as a synt "Bruvvers, all I 'ave is yours.  To-morrer I'm goin' dahn to the Lybour Exchynge to git put on the wytin' list, syme as you!" LORD W.  But, d---it, man, there we should be, all together!  Would that help? LEMMY.  Nao; but it'd syve a lot o' blood.      [LORD WILLIAM stops abruptly, and looks first at LEMMY, then at      the cooler, still cohered with the Chinese mat.] Yer thought the Englishman could be taught to shed blood wiv syfety. Not 'im!  Once yer git 'im into an 'abit, yer cawn't git 'im out of it agyne.  'E'll go on sheddin' blood mechanical--Conservative by nyture.  An' 'e won't myke nuffin' o' yours.  Not even the Press wiv 'is 'oneyed words'll sty 'is 'and. LORD W.  And what do you suggest we could have done, to avoid trouble? LEMMY.  [Warming to his theme]  I'll tell yer.  If all you wealfy nobs wiv kepitel 'ad come it kind from the start after the war yer'd never 'a been 'earin' the Marseillaisy naow.  Lord!  'Ow you did talk abaht Unity and a noo spirit in the Country.  Noo spirit!  Why, soon as ever there was no dynger from outside, yer stawted to myke it inside, wiv an iron'and.  Naow, you've been in the war an' it's given yer a feelin' 'eart; but most of the nobs wiv kepitel was too old or too important to fight.  They weren't born agyne.  So naow that bad times is come, we're 'owlin' for their blood. LORD W.  I quite agree; I quite agree.  I've often said much the same thing. LEMMY.  Voice cryin' in the wilderness--I daon't sy we was yngels-- there was faults on bofe sides.  [He looks at THE PRESS]  The Press could ha' helped yer a lot.  Shall I tell yer wot the Press did? "It's vital," said the Press, "that the country should be united, or it will never recover."  Nao strikes, nao 'omen nature, nao nuffink. Kepitel an' Lybour like the Siamese twins.  And, fust dispute that come along, the Press orfs wiv its coat an' goes at it bald'eaded. An' wot abaht since?  Sich a riot o' nymes called, in Press--and Pawlyement.  Unpatriotic an' outrygeous demands o' lybour. Blood-suckin' tyranny o' Kepitel; thieves an' dawgs an 'owlin Jackybines--gents throwin' books at each other; all the resources of edjucytion exhausted!  If I'd bin Prime Minister I'd 'ave 'ad the Press's gas cut 'orf at the meter.  Puffect liberty, of course, nao Censorship; just sy wot yer like--an' never be 'eard of no more.      [Turning suddenly to THE PRESS, who has been scribbling in pace      with this harangue, and now has developed a touch of writer's      cramp.] Why!  'Is 'end's out o' breath!  Fink o' vet! LORD W.  Great tribute to your eloquence, Mr. Lemmy!      [A sudden stir of applause and scraping of chairs is heard; the      meeting is evidently breaking up.  LADY WILLIAM comes in,      followed by MRS. LEMMY with her trousers, and LITTLE AIDA.      LEMMY stares fixedly at this sudden, radiant apparition.  His      gaze becomes as that of a rabbit regarding a snake.  And      suddenly he puts up his hand and wipes his brow.]      [LADY WILLIAM, going to the table, lifts one end of the Chinese      mat, and looks at LEMMY.  Then she turns to LORD WILLIAM.] LADY W.  Bill! LEMMY.  [To his mother--in a hoarse whisper]  She calls 'im Bill. 'Ow!  'Yn't she IT? LADY W.  [Apart]  Have you--spoken to him?      [LORD WILLIAM shakes his head.] Not?  What have you been saying, then? LORD W.  Nothing, he's talked all the time. LADY W.  [Very low]  What a little caution! LORD W.  Steady, old girl!  He's got his eye on you!      [LADY WILLIAM looks at LEMMY, whose eyes are still fixed on      her.] LADY W.  [With resolution]  Well, I'm going to tackle him.      [She moves towards LEMMY, who again wipes his brow, and wrings      out his hand.] MRS. LEMMY.  Don't 'ee du that, Bob.  Yu must forgive'im, Ma'am; it's 'is admiration.  'E was always one for the ladies, and he'm not used to seein' so much of 'em. LADY W.  Don't you think you owe us an explanation? MRS. LEMMY.  Speak up, Bob.      [But LEMMY only shifts his feet.] My gudeness!  'E've a-lost 'is tongue.  I never knu that 'appen to 'e before. LORD W.  [Trying to break the embarrassment]  No ill-feeling, you know, Lemmy.      [But LEMMY still only rolls his eyes.] LADY W.  Don't you think it was rather--inconsiderate of you? LEMMY.  Muvver, tyke me aht, I'm feelin' fynte!      [Spurts of the Marseillaise and the mutter of the crowd have      been coming nearer; and suddenly a knocking is heard.  POULDER      and JAMES appear between the pillars.] POULDER.  The populace, me Lord! LADY W.  What! LORD W.  Where've you put 'em, Poulder? POULDER.  They've put theirselves in the portico, me Lord. LORD W.  [Suddenly wiping his brow]  Phew!  I say, this is awful, Nell!  Two speeches in one evening.  Nothing else for it, I suppose. Open the window, Poulder! POULDER.  [Crossing to the window]  We are prepared for any sacrifice, me Lord.      [He opens the window.] PRESS.  [Writing furiously]  "Lady William stood like a statue at bay." LORD W.  Got one of those lozenges on you, Nell?      [But LADY WILLIAM has almost nothing on her.] LEMMY.  [Producing a paper from his pocket]  'Ave one o' my gum drops?      [He passes it to LORD WILLIAM.] LORD W.  [Unable to refuse, takes a large, flat gum drop from the paper, and looks at it in embarrassment.]  Ah! thanks!  Thanks awfully!      [LEMMY turns to LITTLE AIDA, and puts a gum drop in her mouth.      A burst of murmurs from the crowd.] JAMES. [Towering above the wine cooler]  If they get saucy, me Lord, I can always give 'em their own back. LORD W.  Steady, James; steady!      [He puts the gum drop absently in his mouth, and turns up to the      open window.] VOICE.  [Outside]  'Ere they are--the bally plutocrats.      [Voices in chorus: "Bread!  Bread!"] LORD W.  Poulder, go and tell the chef to send out anything there is in the house--nicely, as if it came from nowhere in particular. POULDER.  Very good, me Lord.  [Sotto voce]  Any wine?  If I might suggest--German--'ock? LORD W.  What you like. POULDER.  Very good, me Lord. [He goes.] LORD W.  I say, dash it, Nell, my teeth are stuck!  [He works his finger in his mouth.] LADY W.  Take it out, darling. LORD W.  [Taking out the gum drop and looking at it]  What the deuce did I put it in for? PRESS.  ['Writing]  "With inimitable coolness Lord William prepared to address the crowd."      [Voices in chorea: "Bread!  Bread!"] LORD W.  Stand by to prompt, old girl.  Now for it.  This ghastly gum drop!      [LORD WILLIAM takes it from his agitated hand, and flips it      through the window.] VOICE.  Dahn with the aristo----[Chokes.] LADY W.  Oh!  Bill----oh!  It's gone into a mouth! LORD W.  Good God! VOICE.  Wet's this?  Throwin' things?  Mind aht, or we'll smash yer winders!      [As the voices in chorus chant: "Bread! Bread!" LITTLE ANNE,      night-gowned, darts in from the hall.  She is followed by MISS      STOKES.  They stand listening.] LORD W.  [To the Crowd]  My friends, you've come to the wrong shop. There's nobody in London more sympathetic with you.  [The crowd laughs hoarsely.]  [Whispering]  Look out, old girl; they can see your shoulders.  [LORD WILLIAM moves back a step.]  If I were a speaker, I could make you feel---- VOICE.  Look at his white weskit!  Blood-suckers--fattened on the people!      [JAMES dives his hand at the wine cooler.] LORD W.  I've always said the Government ought to take immediate steps---- VOICE.  To shoot us dahn. LORD W.  Not a bit.  To relieve the--er---- LADY W.  [Prompting]  Distress. LADY W.  Distress, and ensure--er--ensure LADY W.  [Prompting] Quiet. LORD W. [To her] No, no.  To ensure--ensure---- L. ANNE.  [Agonized]  Oh, Daddy! VOICE.  'E wants to syve 'is dirty great 'ouse. LORD W.  [Roused]  D----if I do!      [Rude and hoarse laughter from the crowd.] JAMES.  [With fury]  Me Lord, let me blow 'em to glory!      [He raises the cooler and advances towards the window.] LORD W.  [Turning sharply on him]  Drop it, James; drop it! PRESS.  [Jumping]  No, no; don't drop it!      [JAMES retires crestfallen to the table, where he replaces the      cooler.] LORD W.  [Catching hold of his bit]  Look here, I must have fought alongside some of you fellows in the war.  Weren't we jolly well like brothers? A VOICE.  Not so much bloomin' "Kamerad"; hand over yer 'Ouse. LORD W.  I was born with this beastly great house, and money, and goodness knows what other entanglements--a wife and family---- VOICE.  Born with a wife and family!      [Jeers and laughter.] LORD W.  I feel we're all in the same boat, and I want to pull my weight.  If you can show me the way, I'll take it fast enough. A DEEP VOICE.  Step dahn then, an' we'll step up. ANOTHER VOICE.  'Ear, 'Ear!      [A fierce little cheer.] LORD W.  [To LADY WILLIAM--in despair]  By George!  I can't get in anywhere! LADY W.  [Calmly]  Then shut the window, Bill. LEMMY. [Who has been moving towards them slowly]  Lemme sy a word to 'em.      [All stare at him.  LEMMY approaches the window, followed by      LITTLE AIDA.  POULDER re-enters with the three other footmen.] [At the window]  Cheerio!  Cockies!      [The silence of surprise falls on the crowd.] I'm one of yer.  Gas an' water I am.  Got more grievances an' out of employment than any of yer.  I want to see their blood flow, syme as you. PRESS.  [writing]  "Born orator--ready cockney wit--saves situation." LEMMY.  Wot I sy is: Dahn wiv the country, dahn wiv everyfing.  Begin agyne from the foundytions.  [Nodding his head back at the room]  But we've got to keep one or two o' these 'ere under glawss, to show our future generytions.  An' this one is 'armless.  His pipes is sahnd, 'is 'eart is good; 'is 'ead is not strong.  Is 'ouse will myke a charmin' palace o' varieties where our children can come an' see 'ow they did it in the good old dyes.  Yer never see rich waxworks as 'is butler and 'is four conscientious khaki footmen.  Why--wot dyer think 'e 'as 'em for--fear they might be out o'-works like you an' me. Nao!  Keep this one; 'e's a Flower.  'Arf a mo'!  I'll show yer my Muvver.  Come 'ere, old lydy; and bring yer trahsers. [MRS. LEMMY comes forward to the window]  Tell abaht yer speech to the meetin'. MRS. LEMMY.  [Bridling]  Oh dear!  Well, I cam' in with me trousers, an' they putt me up on the pedestory at once, so I tole 'em. [Holding up the trousers]  "I putt in the button'oles, I stretches the flies; I lines the crutch; I putt on this bindin', I presses the seams--Tuppence three farthin's a pair."      [A groan from tote crowd, ] LEMMY. [Showing her off]  Seventy-seven!  Wot's 'er income?  Twelve bob a week; seven from the Gover'ment an' five from the sweat of 'er brow.  Look at 'er!  'Yn't she a tight old dear to keep it goin'!  No workus for 'er, nao fear!  The gryve rather!      [Murmurs from the crowd, at Whom MRS. LEMMY is blandly smiling.] You cawn't git below 'er--impossible!  She's the foundytions of the country--an' rocky 'yn't the word for 'em.  Worked 'ard all 'er life, brought up a family and buried 'em on it.  Twelve bob a week, an' given when 'er fingers goes, which is very near.  Well, naow, this torf 'ere comes to me an' says: "I'd like to do somefin' for yer muvver.  'Ow's ten bob a week?" 'e says.  Naobody arst 'im--quite on 'is own.  That's the sort 'e is.  [Sinking his voice confidentially] Sorft.  You bring yer muvvers 'ere, 'e'll do the syme for them.  I giv yer the 'int. VOICE.  [From the crowd]  What's 'is nyme? LEMMY.  They calls 'im Bill. VOICE.  Bill What? L. ANNE.  Dromondy. LADY W.  Anne! LEMMY.  Dromedary 'is nyme is. VOICE.  [From the crowd]  Three cheers for Bill Dromedary. LEMMY.  I sy, there's veal an' 'am, an' pork wine at the back for them as wants it; I 'eard the word passed.  An' look 'ere, if yer want a flag for the revolution, tyke muvver's trahsers an' tie 'em to the corfin.  Yer cawn't 'ave no more inspirin' banner.  Ketch!  [He throws the trousers out]  Give Bill a double-barrel fast, to show there's no ill-feelin'.  Ip, 'ip!      [The crowd cheers, then slowly passes away, singing at a hoarse      version of the Marseillaise, till all that is heard is a faint      murmuring and a distant barrel-organ playing the same tune.] PRESS.  [Writing]  "And far up in the clear summer air the larks were singing." LORD W.  [Passing his heard over his hair, and blinking his eyes] James!  Ready? JAMES.  Me Lord! L. ANNE.  Daddy! LADY W.  [Taking his arm]  Bill!  It's all right, old man--all right! LORD W.  [Blinking]  Those infernal larks!  Thought we were on the Somme again!  Ah!  Mr. Lemmy, [Still rather dreamy]  no end obliged to you; you're so decent.  Now, why did you want to blow us up before dinner? LEMMY.  Blow yer up?  [Passing his hand over his hair in travesty] "Is it a dream?  Then wykin' would be pyne." MRS. LEMMY.  Bo-ob!  Not so saucy, my boy! LEMMY.  Blow yet up?  Wot abaht it? LADY W.  [Indicating the bomb]  This, Mr. Lemmy!      [LEMMY looks at it, and his eyes roll and goggle.] LORD W.  Come, all's forgiven!  But why did you? LEMMY.  Orl right!  I'm goin' to tyke it awy; it'd a-been a bit ork'ard for me.  I'll want it to-mower. LORD W.  What!  To leave somewhere else? LEMMY.  'Yus, of course! LORD W.  No, no; dash it!  Tell us what's it filled with? LEMMY.  Filled wiv?  Nuffin'.  Wot did yet expect?  Toof-pahder? It's got a bit o' my lead soldered on to it.  That's why it's 'eavy! LORD W.  But what is it? LEMMY.  Wot is it?  [His eyes are fearfully fixed on LADY WILLIAM]  I fought everybody knew 'em. LADY W.  Mr. Lemmy, you must clear this up, please. LEMMY.  [TO LORD WILLIAM, With his eyes still held On LADY WILLIAM-- mysteriously]  Wiv lydies present?  'Adn't I better tell the Press? LORD W.  All right; tell someone--anyone!      [LEMMY goes down to THE PRESS, who is reading over his last      note.  Everyone watches and listens with the utmost discretion,      while he whispers into the ear of THE PRESS; who shakes his head      violently.] PRESS.  No, no; it's too horrible.  It destroys my whole---- LEMMY.  Well, I tell yer it is.      [Whispers again violently.] PRESS.  No, no; I can't have it.  All my article!  All my article! It can't be--no---- LEMMY.  I never see sick an obstinate thick-head!  Yer 'yn't worvy of yet tryde.      [He whispers still more violently and makes cabalistic signs.]      [LADY WILLIAM lifts the bomb from the cooler into the sight of      all.  LORD WILLIAM, seeing it for the first time in full light,      bends double in silent laughter, and whispers to his wife.  LADY      WILLIAM drops the bomb and gives way too.  Hearing the sound,      LEMMY turns, and his goggling eyes pan them all in review.  LORD      and LADY WILLIAM in fits of laughter, LITTLE ANNE stamping her      feet, for MISS STOKES, red, but composed, has her hands placed      firmly over her pupil's eyes and ears; LITTLE AIDA smiling      brilliantly, MRS. LEMMY blandly in sympathy, neither knowing      why; the FOUR FOOTMAN in a row, smothering little explosions.      POULDER, extremely grave and red, THE PRESS perfectly haggard,      gnawing at his nails.] LEMMY.  [Turning to THE PRESS]  Blimy!  It amooses 'em, all but the genteel ones.  Cheer oh!  Press!  Yer can always myke somefin' out o' nufun'?  It's not the fust thing as 'as existed in yer imaginytion only. PRESS.  No, d---it; I'll keep it a bomb! LEMMY.  [Soothingly]  Ah!  Keep the sensytion.  Wot's the troof compared wiv that?  Come on, Muvver! Come on, Little Aida!  Time we was goin' dahn to 'Earf.      [He goes up to the table, and still skidding a little at LADY      WILLIAM, takes the late bomb from the cooler, placing it under      his arm.] MRS. LEMMY.  Gude naight, sir; gude naight, ma'am; thank yu for my cup o' tea, an' all yore kindness.      [She shakes hands with LORD and LADY WILLIAM, drops the curtsey      of her youth before Mr. POULDER, and goes out followed by LITTLE      AIDA, who is looking back at LITTLE ANNE.] LEMMY.  [Turning suddenly]  Aoh!  An' jist one frog!  Next time yer build an 'ouse, daon't forget--it's the foundytions as bears the wyte.      [With a wink that gives way, to a last fascinated look at LADY      WILLIAM, he passes out.  All gaze after them, except THE PRESS,      who is tragically consulting his spiflicated notes.] L. ANNE.  [Breaking away from Miss STOKES and rushing forward]  Oh! Mum!  what was it? CURTAIN

HANNIBAL and EDWARD HALL-MARKED      The scene is the sitting-room and verandah of HER bungalow.      The room is pleasant, and along the back, where the verandah      runs, it seems all window, both French and casement.  There is a      door right and a door left.  The day is bright; the time      morning.      [HERSELF, dripping wet, comes running along the verandah,      through the French window, with a wet Scotch terrier in her      arms.  She vanishes through the door left.  A little pause, and      LADY ELLA comes running, dry, thin, refined, and agitated.  She      halts where the tracks of water cease at the door left.  A      little pause, and MAUD comes running, fairly dry, stolid,      breathless, and dragging a bull-dog, wet, breathless, and stout,      by the crutch end of her 'en-tout-cas']. LADY ELLA.  Don't bring Hannibal in till I know where she's put Edward! MAUD.  [Brutally, to HANNIBAL]  Bad dog!  Bad dog!      [HANNIBAL snuffles.] LADY ELLA.  Maud, do take him out!  Tie him up.  Here!  [She takes out a lace handkerchief ]  No--something stronger!  Poor darling Edward!  [To HANNIBAL]  You are a bad dog!      [HANNIBAL snuffles.] MAUD.  Edward began it, Ella.  [To HANNIBAL]  Bad dog!  Bad dog!      [HANNIBAL snuffles.] LADY ELLA.  Tie him up outside.  Here, take my scarf.  Where is my poor treasure?  [She removes her scarf]  Catch!  His ear's torn; I saw it. MAUD.  [Taking the scarf, to HANNIBAL]  Now!      [HANNIBAL snuffles.]      [She ties the scarf to his collar] He smells horrible.  Bad dog--getting into ponds to fight! LADY ELLA.  Tie him up, Maud.  I must try in here.      [Their husbands, THE SQUIRE and THE RECTOR, come hastening along      the verandah.] MAUD.  [To THE RECTOR]  Smell him, Bertie!  [To THE SQUIRE]  You might have that pond drained, Squire!      [She takes HANNIBAL out, and ties him to the verandah.  THE      SQUIRE and RECTOR Come in.  LADY ELLA is knocking on the door      left.] HER VOICE.  All right!  I've bound him up! LADY ELLA.  May I come in? HER VOICE.  Just a second!  I've got nothing on.      [LADY ELLA recoils.  THE SQUIRE and RECTOR make an involuntary      movement of approach.] LADY ELLA.  Oh!  There you are! THE RECTOR.  [Doubtfully]  I was just going to wade in---- LADY ELLA.  Hannibal would have killed him, if she hadn't rushed in! THE SQUIRE.  Done him good, little beast! LADY ELLA.  Why didn't you go in, Tommy? THE SQUIRE.  Well, I would--only she---- LADY ELLA.  I can't think how she got Edward out of Hannibal's awful mouth! MAUD.  [Without--to HANNIBAL, who is snuffling on the verandah and straining at the scarf]  Bad dog! LADY ELLA.  We must simply thank her tremendously!  I shall never forget the way she ran in, with her skirts up to her waist! THE SQUIRE.  By Jove!  No.  It was topping. LADY ELLA.  Her clothes must be ruined.  That pond--ugh! [She wrinkles her nose]  Tommy, do have it drained. THE RECTOR.  [Dreamily]  I don't remember her face in church. THE SQUIRE.  Ah!  Yes.  Who is she?  Pretty woman! LADY ELLA.  I must get the Vet. to Edward.  [To THE SQUIRE]  Tommy, do exert yourself!      [MAUD re-enters.] THE SQUIRE.  All right!  [Exerting himself]  Here's a bell! HER VOICE.  [Through the door]  The bleeding's stopped.  Shall I send him in to you? LADY ELLA.  Oh, please!  Poor darling!      [They listen.]      [LADY ELLA, prepares to receive EDWARD.  THE SQUIRE and RECTOR      stand transfixed.  The door opens, and a bare arm gently pushes      EDWARD forth.  He is bandaged with a smooth towel.  There is a      snuffle--HANNIBAL has broken the scarf, outside.] LADY ELLA.  [Aghast]  Look!  Hannibal's loose!  Maud--Tommy.  [To THE RECTOR]  You!      [The THREE rush to prevent HANNIBAL from re-entering.] LADY ELLA.  [To EDWARD]  Yes, I know--you'd like to!  You SHALL bite him when it's safe.  Oh!  my darling, you DO----[She sniffs].      [MAUD and THE SQUIRE re-enter.] Have you tied him properly this time? MAUD.  With Bertie's braces. LADY ELLA.  Oh! but---- MAUD.  It's all right; they're almost leather.      [THE RECTOR re-enters, with a slight look of insecurity.] LADY ELLA.  Rector, are you sure it's safe? THE RECTOR.  [Hitching at his trousers]  No, indeed, LADY Ella--I---- LADY ELLA.  Tommy, do lend a hand! THE SQUIRE.  All right, Ella; all right!  He doesn't mean what you mean! LADY ELLA.  [Transferring EDWARD to THE SQUIRE]  Hold him, Tommy. He's sure to smell out Hannibal! THE SQUIRE.  [Taking EDWARD by the collar, and holding his own nose] Jove!  Clever if he can smell anything but himself.  Phew!  She ought to have the Victoria Cross for goin' in that pond.      [The door opens, and HERSELF appears; a fine, frank, handsome      woman, in a man's orange-coloured motor-coat, hastily thrown on      over the substrata of costume.] SHE.  So very sorry--had to have a bath, and change, of course! LADY ELLA.  We're so awfully grateful to you.  It was splendid. MAUD.  Quite. THE RECTOR.  [Rather holding himself together]  Heroic!  I was just myself about to---- THE SQUIRE.  [Restraining EDWARD]  Little beast will fight--must apologise--you were too quick for me----      [He looks up at her.  She is smiling, and regarding the wounded      dog, her head benevolently on one side.] SHE.  Poor dears!  They thought they were so safe in that nice pond! LADY ELLA.  Is he very badly torn? SHE.  Rather nasty.  There ought to be a stitch or two put in his ear. LADY ELLA.  I thought so.  Tommy, do---- THE SQUIRE.  All right.  Am I to let him go? LADY ELLA.  No. MAUD.  The fly's outside.  Bertie, run and tell Jarvis to drive in for the Vet. THE RECTOR.  [Gentle and embarrassed]  Run?  Well, Maud--I---- SHE.  The doctor would sew it up.  My maid can go round.      [HANNIBAL.  appears at the open casement with the broken braces      dangling from his collar.] LADY ELLA.  Look!  Catch him!  Rector! MAUD.  Bertie!  Catch him!      [THE RECTOR seizes HANNIBAL, but is seen to be in difficulties      with his garments.  HERSELF, who has gone out left, returns,      with a leather strop in one hand and a pair of braces in the      other.] SHE.  Take this strop--he can't break that.  And would these be any good to you?      [SHE hands the braces to MAUD and goes out on to the verandah      and hastily away.  MAUD, transferring the braces to the RECTOR,      goes out, draws HANNIBAL from the casement window, and secures      him with the strap.  THE RECTOR sits suddenly with the braces in      his hands.  There is a moment's peace.] LADY ELLA.  Splendid, isn't she?  I do admire her. THE SQUIRE.  She's all there. THE RECTOR.  [Feelingly]  Most kind.      [He looks ruefully at the braces and at LADY ELLA.  A silence.      MAUD reappears at the door and stands gazing at the braces.] THE SQUIRE.  [Suddenly]  Eh? MAUD.  Yes. THE SQUIRE.  [Looking at his wife]  Ah! LADY ELLA.  [Absorbed in EDWARD]  Poor darling! THE SQUIRE.  [Bluntly]  Ella, the Rector wants to get up! THE RECTOR.  [Gently]  Perhaps--just for a moment---- LADY ELLA.  Oh!  [She turns to the wall.]      [THE RECTOR, screened by his WIFE, retires on to the verandah to      adjust his garments.] THE SQUIRE.  [Meditating]  So she's married! LADY ELLA.  [Absorbed in EDWARD]  Why? THE SQUIRE.  Braces. LADY ELLA.  Oh!  Yes.  We ought to ask them to dinner, Tommy. THE SQUIRE.  Ah!  Yes.  Wonder who they are?      [THE RECTOR and MAUD reappear.] THE RECTOR.  Really very good of her to lend her husband's--I was-- er--quite---- MAUD.  That'll do, Bertie.      [THEY see HER returning along the verandah, followed by a sandy,      red-faced gentleman in leather leggings, with a needle and      cotton in his hand.] HERSELF.  Caught the doctor just starting, So lucky! LADY ELLA.  Oh!  Thank goodness! DOCTOR.  How do, Lady Ella?  How do, Squire?--how do, Rector?  [To MAUD]  How de do?  This the beastie?  I see.  Quite!  Who'll hold him for me? LADY ELLA.  Oh!  I! HERSELF.  D'you know, I think I'd better.  It's so dreadful when it's your own, isn't it?  Shall we go in here, doctor?  Come along, pretty boy!      [She takes EDWARD, and they pass into the room, left.] LADY ELLA.  I dreaded it.  She is splendid! THE SQUIRE.  Dogs take to her.  That's a sure sign. THE RECTOR.  Little things--one can always tell. THE SQUIRE.  Something very attractive about her--what!  Fine build of woman. MAUD.  I shall get hold of her for parish work. THE RECTOR.  Ah!  Excellent--excellent!  Do! THE SQUIRE.  Wonder if her husband shoots?  She seems quite-er--quite---- LADY ELLA.  [Watching the door]  Quite!  Altogether charming; one of the nicest faces I ever saw.      [THE DOCTOR comes out alone.] Oh!  Doctor--have you? is it----? DOCTOR.  Right as rain!  She held him like an angel--he just licked her, and never made a sound. LADY ELLA.  Poor darling!  Can I----      [She signs toward the door.] DOCTOR.  Better leave 'em a minute.  She's moppin' 'im off.  [He wrinkles his nose]  Wonderful clever hands! THE SQUIRE.  I say--who is she? DOCTOR.  [Looking from face to face with a dubious and rather quizzical expression]  Who?  Well--there you have me!  All I know is she's a first-rate nurse--been helpin' me with a case in Ditch Lane. Nice woman, too--thorough good sort!  Quite an acquisition here. H'm!  [Again that quizzical glance]  Excuse me hurryin' off--very late.  Good-bye, Rector.  Good-bye, Lady Ella.  Good-bye!      [He goes.  A silence.] THE SQUIRE.  H'm!  I suppose we ought to be a bit careful.      [JARVIS, flyman of the old school, has appeared on the      verandah.] JARVIS.  [To THE RECTOR]  Beg pardon, sir.  Is the little dog all right? MAUD.  Yes. JARVIS.  [Touching his hat]  Seein' you've missed your train, m'm, shall I wait, and take you 'ome again? MAUD.  No. JARVIS.  Cert'nly, m'm.  [He touches his hat with a circular gesture, and is about to withdraw.] LADY ELLA.  Oh, Jarvis--what's the name of the people here? JARVIS.  Challenger's the name I've driven 'em in, my lady. THE SQUIRE.  Challenger?  Sounds like a hound.  What's he like? JARVIS.  [Scratching his head]  Wears a soft 'at, sir. THE SQUIRE.  H'm!  Ah! JARVIS.  Very nice gentleman, very nice lady.  'Elped me with my old mare when she 'ad the 'ighsteria last week--couldn't 'a' been kinder if they'd 'a' been angels from 'eaven.  Wonderful fond o' dumb animals, the two of 'em.  I don't pay no attention to gossip, meself. MAUD.  Gossip?  What gossip? JARVIS.  [Backing]  Did I make use of the word, m'm?  You'll excuse me, I'm sure.  There's always talk where there's newcomers.  I takes people as I finds 'em. THE RECTOR.  Yes, yes, Jarvis--quite--quite right! JARVIS.  Yes, sir.  I've--I've got a 'abit that way at my time o' life. MAUD.  [Sharply]  How long have they been here, Jarvis? JARVIS.  Well---er--a matter of three weeks, m'm.      [A slight involuntary stir.] [Apologetic]  Of course, in my profession I can't afford to take notice of whether there's the trifle of a ring between 'em, as the sayin' is.  'Tisn't 'ardly my business like.      [A silence.] LADY ELLA.  [Suddenly]  Er--thank you, Jarvis; you needn't wait. JARVIS.  No, m'lady.  Your service, sir--service, m'm.      [He goes.  A silence.] THE SQUIRE.  [Drawing a little closer]  Three weeks?  I say--er-- wasn't there a book? THE RECTOR.  [Abstracted]  Three weeks----I certainly haven't seen them in church. MAUD.  A trifle of a ring! LADY ELLA.  [Impulsively]  Oh, bother!  I'm sure she's all right. And if she isn't, I don't care.  She's been much too splendid. THE SQUIRE.  Must think of the village.  Didn't quite like the doctor's way of puttin' us off. LADY ELLA.  The poor darling owes his life to her. THE SQUIRE.  H'm!  Dash it!  Yes!  Can't forget the way she ran into that stinkin' pond. MAUD.  Had she a wedding-ring on?      [They look at each other, but no one knows.] LADY ELLA.  Well, I'm not going to be ungrateful. THE SQUIRE.  It'd be dashed awkward--mustn't take a false step, Ella. THE RECTOR.  And I've got his braces!  [He puts his hand to his waist.] MAUD.  [Warningly]  Bertie! THE SQUIRE.  That's all right, Rector--we're goin' to be perfectly polite, and--and--thank her, and all that. LADY ELLA.  We can see she's a good sort.  What does it matter? MAUD.  My dear Ella!  "What does it matter!"  We've got to know. THE RECTOR.  We do want light. THE SQUIRE.  I'll ring the bell.  [He rings.]      [They look at each other aghast.] LADY ELLA.  What did you ring for, Tommy? THE SQUIRE.  [Flabbergasted]  God knows! MAUD.  Somebody'll come. THE SQUIRE.  Rector--you--you've got to---- MAUD.  Yes, Bertie. THE RECTOR.  Dear me!  But--er--what--er----How? THE SQUIRE.  [Deeply-to himself]  The whole thing's damn delicate.      [The door right is opened and a MAID appears.  She is a      determined-looking female.  They face her in silence.] THE RECTOR.  Er--er----your master is not in? THE MAID.  No.  'E's gone up to London. THE RECTOR.  Er----Mr Challenger, I think? THE MAID.  Yes. THE RECTOR.  Yes!  Er----quite so THE MAID.  [Eyeing them]  D'you want--Mrs Challenger? THE RECTOR.  Ah! Not precisely---- THE SQUIRE.  [To him in a low, determined voice]  Go on. THE RECTOR.  [Desperately]  I asked because there was a--a--Mr. Challenger I used to know in the 'nineties, and I thought--you wouldn't happen to know how long they've been married?  My friend marr---- THE MAID.  Three weeks. THE RECTOR.  Quite so--quite so!  I shall hope it will turn out to be----Er--thank you--Ha! LADY ELLA.  Our dog has been fighting with the Rector's, and Mrs Challenger rescued him;  she's bathing his ear.  We're waiting to thank her.  You needn't---- THE MAID.  [Eyeing them]  No.      [She turns and goes out.] THE SQUIRE.  Phew!  What a gorgon!  I say, Rector, did you really know a Challenger in the 'nineties? THE RECTOR.  [Wiping his brow]  No. THE SQUIRE.  Ha!  Jolly good! LADY ELLA.  Well, you see!--it's all right. THE RECTOR.  Yes, indeed.  A great relief! LADY ELLA.  [Moving to the door]  I must go in now. THE SQUIRE.  Hold on!  You goin' to ask 'em to--to--anything? LADY ELLA.  Yes. MAUD.  I shouldn't. LADY ELLA.  Why not?  We all like the look of her. THE RECTOR.  I think we should punish ourselves for entertaining that uncharitable thought. LADY ELLA.  Yes.  It's horrible not having the courage to take people as they are. THE SQUIRE.  As they are?  H'm!  How can you till you know? LADY ELLA.  Trust our instincts, of course. THE SQUIRE.  And supposing she'd turned out not married--eh! LADY ELLA!  She'd still be herself, wouldn't she? MAUD.  Ella! THE SQUIRE.  H'm!  Don't know about that. LADY ELLA.  Of course she would, Tommy. THE RECTOR.  [His hand stealing to his waist]  Well!  It's a great weight off my----! LADY ELLA.  There's the poor darling snuffling.  I must go in.      [She knocks on the door.  It is opened, and EDWARD comes out      briskly, with a neat little white pointed ear-cap on one ear.] LADY ELLA.  Precious!      [SHE HERSELF Comes out, now properly dressed in flax-blue      linen.] LADY ELLA.  How perfectly sweet of you to make him that! SHE.  He's such a dear.  And the other poor dog? MAUD.  Quite safe, thanks to your strop.      [HANNIBAL appears at the window, with the broken strop dangling.      Following her gaze, they turn and see him.] MAUD.  Oh!  There, he's broken it.  Bertie! SHE.  Let me!  [She seizes HANNIBAL.] THE SQUIRE.  We're really most tremendously obliged to you.  Afraid we've been an awful nuisance. SHE.  Not a bit.  I love dogs. THE SQUIRE.  Hope to make the acquaintance of Mr----of your husband. LADY ELLA.  [To EDWARD, who is straining]      [Gently, darling!  Tommy, take him.]      [THE SQUIRE does so.] MAUD.  [Approaching HANNIBAL.]  Is he behaving?      [She stops short, and her face suddenly shoots forward at HER      hands that are holding HANNIBAL'S neck.] SHE.  Oh!  yes--he's a love. MAUD.  [Regaining her upright position, and pursing her lips; in a peculiar voice]  Bertie, take Hannibal. THE RECTOR takes him. LADY ELLA.  [Producing a card]  I can't be too grateful for all you've done for my poor darling.  This is where we live.  Do come-- and see----      [MAUD, whose eyes have never left those hands, tweaks LADY      ELLA's dress.] LADY ELLA.  That is--I'm--I----      [HERSELF looks at LADY ELLA in surprise.] THE SQUIRE.  I don't know if your husband shoots, but if----      [MAUD, catching his eye, taps the third finger of her left      hand.] --er--he--does--er--er----      [HERSELF looks at THE SQUIRE surprised.] MAUD.  [Turning to her husband, repeats the gesture with the low and simple word]  Look! THE RECTOR.  [With round eyes, severely]  Hannibal!  [He lifts him bodily and carries him away.] MAUD.  Don't squeeze him, Bertie!      [She follows through the French window.] THE SQUIRE.  [Abruptly--of the unoffending EDWARD]  That dog'll be forgettin' himself in a minute.      [He picks up EDWARD and takes him out.]      [LADY ELLA is left staring.] LADY ELLA.  [At last]  You mustn't think, I----You mustn't think, we ----Oh!  I must just see they--don't let Edward get at Hannibal.      [She skims away.]      [HERSELF is left staring after LADY ELLA, in surprise.] SHE.  What is the matter with them?      [The door is opened.] THE MAID.  [Entering and holding out a wedding-ring--severely]  You left this, m'm, in the bathroom. SHE.  [Looking, startled, at her finger]  Oh! [Taking it]  I hadn't missed it.  Thank you, Martha.      [THE MAID goes.]      [A hand, slipping in at the casement window, softly lays a pair      of braces on the windowsill.  SHE looks at the braces, then at      the ring.  HER lip curls.] Sue.  [Murmuring deeply]  Ah!                               CURTAIN DEFEAT A Tiny Drama      CHARACTERS      THE OFFICER.      THE GIRL.                   DURING THE GREAT WAR.  EVENING.      An empty room.  The curtains drawn and gas turned low.  The      furniture and walls give a colour-impression as of greens and      beetroot.  There is a prevalence of plush.  A fireplace on the      Left, a sofa, a small table; the curtained window is at the      back.  On the table, in a common pot, stands a little plant of      maidenhair fern, fresh and green.      Enter from the door on the Right, a GIRL and a YOUNG OFFICER in      khaki.  The GIRL wears a discreet dark dress, hat, and veil, and      stained yellow gloves.  The YOUNG OFFICER is tall, with a fresh      open face, and kindly eager blue eyes; he is a little lame.  The      GIRL, who is evidently at home, moves towards the gas jet to      turn it up, then changes her mind, and going to the curtains,      draws them apart and throws up the window.  Bright moonlight      comes flooding in.  Outside are seen the trees of a little      Square.  She stands gazing out, suddenly turns inward with a      shiver. YOUNG OFF.  I say; what's the matter?  You were crying when I spoke to you. GIRL.  [With a movement of recovery]  Oh!  nothing.  The beautiful evening-that's all. YOUNG OFF.  [Looking at her]  Cheer up! GIRL.  [Taking of hat and veil; her hair is yellowish and crinkly] Cheer up!  You are not lonelee, like me. YOUNG OFF.  [Limping to the window--doubtfully]  I say, how did you how did you get into this?  Isn't it an awfully hopeless sort of life? GIRL.  Yees, it ees.  You haf been wounded? YOUNG OFF.  Just out of hospital to-day. GIRL.  The horrible war--all the misery is because of the war.  When will it end? YOUNG OFF.  [Leaning against the window-sill, looking at her attentively]  I say, what nationality are you? GIRL.  [With a quick look and away]  Rooshian. YOUNG OFF.  Really!  I never met a Russian girl.  [The GIRL gives him another quick look]  I say, is it as bad as they make out? GIRL.  [Slipping her hand through his arm]  Not when I haf anyone as ni-ice as you; I never haf had, though.  [She smiles, and her smile, like her speech, is slow and confining]  You stopped because I was sad, others stop because I am gay.  I am not fond of men at all. When you know--you are not fond of them. YOUNG OFF.  Well, you hardly know them at their best, do you?  You should see them in the trenches.  By George!  They're simply splendid--officers and men, every blessed soul.  There's never been anything like it--just one long bit of jolly fine self-sacrifice; it's perfectly amazing. GIRL.  [Turning her blue-grey eyes on him]  I expect you are not the last at that.  You see in them what you haf in yourself, I think. YOUNG OFF.  Oh, not a bit; you're quite out!  I assure you when we made the attack where I got wounded there wasn't a single man in my regiment who wasn't an absolute hero.  The way they went in--never thinking of themselves--it was simply ripping. GIRL.  [In a queer voice]  It is the same too, perhaps, with--the enemy. YOUNG OFF.  Oh, yes!  I know that. GIRL.  Ah!  You are not a mean man.  How I hate mean men! YOUNG OFF.  Oh! they're not mean really--they simply don't understand. GIRL.  Oh!  You are a babee--a good babee aren't you?      [The YOUNG OFFICER doesn't like this, and frowns.  The GIRL      looks a little scared.] GIRL.  [Clingingly]  But I li-ke you for it.  It is so good to find a ni-ice man. YOUNG OFF.  [Abruptly]  About being lonely?  Haven't you any Russian friends? GIRL.  [Blankly]  Rooshian?  No.  [Quickly]  The town is so beeg. Were you at the concert before you spoke to me? YOUNG OFF.  Yes. GIRL.  I too.  I lofe music. YOUNG OFF.  I suppose all Russians do. GIRL.  [With another quick look tat him]  I go there always when I haf the money. YOUNG OFF.  What!  Are you as badly on the rocks as that? GIRL.  Well, I haf just one shilling now!      [She laughs bitterly.  The laugh upsets him; he sits on the      window-sill, and leans forward towards her.] YOUNG OFF.  I say, what's your name? GIRL.  May.  Well, I call myself that.  It is no good asking yours. YOUNG OFF.  [With a laugh]  You're a distrustful little soul; aren't you? GIRL.  I haf reason to be, don't you think? YOUNG OFF.  Yes.  I suppose you're bound to think us all brutes. GIRL.  [Sitting on a chair close to the window where the moonlight falls on one powdered cheek]  Well, I haf a lot of reasons to be afraid all my time.  I am dreadfully nervous now; I am not trusding anybody.  I suppose you haf been killing lots of Germans? YOUNG OFF.  We never know, unless it happens to be hand to hand; I haven't come in for that yet. GIRL.  But you would be very glad if you had killed some. YOUNG OFF.  Oh, glad?  I don't think so.  We're all in the same boat, so far as that's concerned.  We're not glad to kill each other--not most of us.  We do our job--that's all. GIRL.  Oh!  It is frightful.  I expect I haf my brothers killed. YOUNG OFF.  Don't you get any news ever? GIRL.  News?  No indeed, no news of anybody in my country.  I might not haf a country; all that I ever knew is gone; fader, moder, sisters, broders, all;  never any more I shall see them, I suppose, now.  The war it breaks and breaks, it breaks hearts.  [She gives a little snarl]  Do you know what I was thinking when you came up to me?  I was thinking of my native town, and the river in the moonlight.  If I could see it again I would be glad.  Were you ever homeseeck? YOUNG OFF.  Yes, I have been--in the trenches.  But one's ashamed with all the others. GIRL.  Ah!  Yees!  Yees!  You are all comrades there.  What is it like for me here, do you think, where everybody hates and despises me, and would catch me and put me in prison, perhaps.  [Her breast heaves.] YOUNG OFF.  [Leaning forward and patting her knee]  Sorry--sorry. GIRL.  [In a smothered voice]  You are the first who has been kind to me for so long!  I will tell you the truth--I am not Rooshian at all --I am German. YOUNG OFF.  [Staring]  My dear girl, who cares.   We aren't fighting against women. GIRL.  [Peering at him]  Another man said that to me.  But he was thinkin' of his fun.  You are a veree ni-ice boy; I am so glad I met you.  You see the good in people, don't you?  That is the first thing in the world--because--there is really not much good in people, you know. YOUNG OFF.  [Smiling]  You are a dreadful little cynic!  But of course you are! GIRL.  Cyneec?  How long do you think I would live if I was not a cyneec?  I should drown myself to-morrow.  Perhaps there are good people, but, you see, I don't know them. YOUNG OFF.  I know lots. GIRL.  [Leaning towards him]  Well now--see, ni-ice boy--you haf never been in a hole, haf you? YOUNG OFF.  I suppose not a real hole. GIRL.  No, I should think not, with your face.  Well, suppose I am still a good girl, as I was once, you know; and you took me to your mother and your sisters and you said: "Here is a little German girl that has no work, and no money, and no friends."  They will say: "Oh! how sad!  A German girl!"  And they will go and wash their hands.      [The OFFICER, is silent, staring at her.] GIRL.  You see. YOUNG OFF.  [Muttering]  I'm sure there are people. GIRL.  No.  They would not take a German, even if she was good. Besides, I don't want to be good any more--I am not a humbug; I have learned to be bad.  Aren't you going to kees me, ni-ice boy? She puts her face close to his.  Her eyes trouble him; he draws back. YOUNG OFF.  Don't.  I'd rather not, if you don't mind.  [She looks at him fixedly, with a curious inquiring stare]  It's stupid.  I don't know--but you see, out there, and in hospital, life's different. It's--it's--it isn't mean, you know.  Don't come too close. GIRL.  Oh!  You are fun----[She stops]  Doesn't it light.  No Zeps to-night.  When they burn--what a 'orrble death!  And all the people cheer.  It is natural.   Do you hate us veree much? YOUNG OFF.  [Turning sharply]  Hate?  I don't know. GIRL.  I don't hate even the English--I despise them.  I despise my people too; even more, because they began this war.  Oh! I know that. I despise all the peoples.  Why haf they made the world so miserable --why haf they killed all our lives--hundreds and thousands and millions of lives--all for noting?  They haf made a bad world-- everybody hating, and looking for the worst everywhere.  They haf made me bad, I know.  I believe no more in anything.  What is there to believe in?  Is there a God?  No!  Once I was teaching little English children their prayers--isn't that funnee?  I was reading to them about Christ and love.  I believed all those things.  Now I believe noting at all--no one who is not a fool or a liar can believe.  I would like to work in a 'ospital; I would like to go and 'elp poor boys like you.  Because I am a German they would throw me out a 'undred times, even if I was good.  It is the same in Germany, in France, in Russia, everywhere.  But do you think I will believe in Love and Christ and God and all that--Not I!  I think we are animals --that's all!  Oh, yes! you fancy it is because my life has spoiled me.  It is not that at all--that is not the worst thing in life.  The men I take are not ni-ice, like you, but it's their nature; and--they help me to live, which is something for me, anyway.  No, it is the men who think themselves great and good and make the  war with their talk and their hate, killing us all--killing all the boys like you, and keeping poor People in prison, and telling us to go on hating; and all these dreadful cold-blood creatures who write in the papers --the same in my country--just the same; it is because of all of them that I think we are only animals.      [The YOUNG OFFICER gets up, acutely miserable.]      [She follows him with her eyes.] GIRL.  Don't mind me talkin', ni-ice boy.  I don't know anyone to talk to.  If you don't like it, I can be quiet as a mouse. YOUNG OFF.  Oh, go on!  Talk away; I'm not obliged to believe you, and I don't.      [She, too, is on her feet now, leaning against the wall; her      dark dress and white face just touched by the slanting      moonlight.  Her voice comes again, slow and soft and bitter.] GIRL.  Well, look here, ni-ice boy, what sort of world is it, where millions are being tortured, for no fault of theirs, at all?  A beautiful world, isn't it?  'Umbog!  Silly rot, as you boys call it. You say it is all "Comrades" and braveness out there at the front, and people don't think of themselves.  Well, I don't think of myself veree much.  What does it matter?  I am lost now, anyway.  But I think of my people at 'ome; how they suffer and grieve.  I think of all the poor people there, and here, how lose those they love, and all the poor prisoners.  Am I not to think of them?  And if I do, how am I to believe it a beautiful world, ni-ice boy?      [He stands very still, staring at her.] GIRL.  Look here!  We haf one life each, and soon it is over.  Well, I think that is lucky. YOUNG OFF.  No!  There's more than that. GIRL.  [Softly]  Ah!  You think the war is fought for the future; you are giving your lives for a better world, aren't you? YOUNG OFF.  We must fight till we win. GIRL.  Till you win.  My people think that too.  All the peoples think that if they win the world will be better.  But it will not, you know; it will be much worse, anyway.      [He turns away from her, and catches up his cap.  Her voice      follows him.] GIRL.  I don't care which win.  I don't care if my country is beaten. I despise them all--animals--animals.  Ah!  Don't go, ni-ice boy; I will be quiet now.      [He has taken some notes from his tunic pocket; he puts then on      the table and goes up to her.] YOUNG OFF.  Good-night. GIRL.  [Plaintively]  Are you really going?  Don't you like me enough? YOUNG OFF.  Yes, I like you. GIRL.  It is because I am German, then? YOUNG OFF.  No. GIRL.  Then why won't you stay? YOUNG OFF.  [With a shrug]  If you must know--because you upset me. GIRL.  Won't you kees me once?      [He bends, puts his lips to her forehead.  But as he takes them      away she throws her head back, presses her mouth to his, and      clings to him.] YOUNG OFF.  [Sitting down suddenly]  Don't!  I don't want to feel a brute. GIRL.  [Laughing]  You are a funny boy; but you are veree good.  Talk to me a little, then.  No one talks to me.  Tell me, haf you seen many German prisoners? YOUNG OFF.  [Sighing]  A good many. GIRL.  Any from the Rhine? YOUNG OFF.  Yes, I think so. GIRL.  Were they veree sad? YOUNG OFF.  Some were; some were quite glad to be taken. GIRL.  Did you ever see the Rhine?  It will be wonderful to-night. The moonlight will be the same there, and in Rooshia too, and France, everywhere; and the trees will look the same as here, and people will meet under them and make love just as here.  Oh! isn't it stupid, the war?  As if it were not good to be alive! YOUNG OFF.  You can't tell how good it is to be alive till you're facing death.  You don't live till then.  And when a whole lot of you feel like that--and are ready to give their lives for each other, it's worth all the rest of life put together.      [He stops, ashamed of such, sentiment before this girl, who      believes in nothing.] GIRL.  [Softly]  How were you wounded, ni-ice boy? YOUNG OFF.  Attacking across open ground: four machine bullets got me at one go off. GIRL.  Weren't you veree frightened when they ordered you to attack?      [He shakes his head and laughs.] YOUNG OFF.  It was great.  We did laugh that morning.  They got me much too soon, though--a swindle. GIRL.  [Staring at him]  You laughed? YOUNG OFF.  Yes.  And what do you think was the first thing I was conscious of next morning?  My old Colonel bending over me and giving me a squeeze of lemon.  If you knew my Colonel you'd still believe in things.  There is something, you know, behind all this evil.  After all, you can only die once, and, if it's for your country--all the better!      [Her face, in the moonlight, with, intent eyes touched up with      black, has a most strange, other-world look.] GIRL.  No; I believe in nothing, not even in my country.  My heart is dead. YOUNG OFF.  Yes; you think so, but it isn't, you know, or you wouldn't have 'been crying when I met you. GIRL.  If it were not dead, do you think I could live my life-walking the streets every night, pretending to like strange men; never hearing a kind word; never talking, for fear I will be known for a German?  Soon I shall take to drinking; then I shall be "Kaput" veree quick.  You see, I am practical; I see things clear.  To-night I am a little emotional; the moon is funny, you know.  But I live for myself only, now.  I don't care for anything or anybody. YOUNG OFF.  All the same; just now you were pitying your folk at home, and prisoners and that. GIRL.  Yees; because they suffer.  Those who suffer are like me--I pity myself, that's all; I am different from your English women.  I see what I am doing; I do not let my mind become a turnip just because I am no longer moral. YOUNG OFF.  Nor your heart either, for all you say. GIRL.  Ni-ice boy, you are veree obstinate.  But all that about love is 'umbog.  We love ourselves, noting more.      At that intense soft bitterness in her voice, he gets up,      feeling stifled, and stands at the window.  A newspaper boy some      way off is calling his wares.  The GIRL's fingers slip between      his own, and stay unmoving.  He looks round into her face.  In      spite of make-up it has a queer, unholy, touching beauty. YOUNG OFF.  [With an outburst]  No; we don't only love ourselves; there is more.  I can't explain, but there's something great; there's kindness--and--and-----      [The shouting of newspaper boys grows louder and their cries,      passionately vehement, clash into each other and obscure each      word.  His head goes up to listen; her hand tightens within his      arm--she too is listening.  The cries come nearer, hoarser, more      shrill and clamorous; the empty moonlight outside seems suddenly      crowded with figures, footsteps, voices, and a fierce distant      cheering.  "Great victory--great victory!  Official!  British!      'Eavy defeat of the 'Uns!  Many thousand prisoners!  'Eavy      defeat!" It speeds by, intoxicating, filling him with a fearful      joy; he leans far out, waving his cap and cheering like a      madman; the night seems to flutter and vibrate and answer.  He      turns to rush down into the street, strikes against something      soft, and recoils.  The GIRL stands with hands clenched, and      face convulsed, panting.  All confused with the desire to do      something, he stoops to kiss her hand.  She snatches away her      fingers, sweeps up the notes he has put down, and holds them out      to him.] GIRL.  Take them--I will not haf your English money--take them.      Suddenly she tears them across, twice, thrice, lets the bits.      flutter to the floor, and turns her back on him.  He stands      looking at her leaning against the plush-covered table, her head      down, a dark figure in a dark room, with the moonlight      sharpening her outline.  Hardly a moment he stays, then makes      for the door.  When he is gone, she still stands there, her chin      on her breast, with the sound in her ears of cheering, of      hurrying feet, and voices crying: "'Eavy Defeat!" stands, in the      centre of a pattern made by the fragments of the torn-up notes,      staring out unto the moonlight, seeing not this hated room and      the hated Square outside, but a German orchard, and herself, a      little girl, plucking apples, a big dog beside her; and a      hundred other pictures, such as the drowning see.  Then she      sinks down on the floor, lays her forehead on the dusty carpet,      and presses her body to it.  Mechanically, she sweeps together      the scattered fragments of notes, assembling them with the dust      into a little pile, as of fallen leaves, and dabbling in it with      her fingers, while the tears run down her cheeks. GIRL.  Defeat!  Der Vaterland!  Defeat!....  One shillin'!      [Then suddenly, in the moonlight, she sits up, and begins to      sing with all her might "Die Wacht am Rhein."  And outside men      pass, singing: "Rule, Britannia!"]                               CURTAIN THE SUN A Scene      CHARACTERS      THE GIRL.      THE MAN.      THE SOLDIER.                               THE SUN      A Girl, sits crouched over her knees on a stile close to a      river.  A MAN with a silver badge stands beside her, clutching      the worn top plank.  THE GIRL'S level brows are drawn together;      her eyes see her memories.  THE MAN's eyes see THE GIRL; he has      a dark, twisted face.  The bright sun shines; the quiet river      flows; the Cuckoo is calling; the mayflower is in bloom along      the hedge that ends in the stile on the towing-path. THE GIRL.  God knows what 'e'll say, Jim. THE MAN.  Let 'im.  'E's come too late, that's all. THE GIRL.  He couldn't come before.  I'm frightened.  'E was fond o' me. THE MAN.  And aren't I fond of you? THE GIRL.  I ought to 'a waited, Jim; with 'im in the fightin'. THE MAN.  [Passionately]  And what about me?  Aren't I been in the fightin'--earned all I could get? THE GIRL.  [Touching him]  Ah! THE MAN.  Did you--?  [He cannot speak the words.] THE GIRL.  Not like you, Jim--not like you. THE MAN.  Have a spirit, then. THE GIRL.  I promised him. THE MAN.  One man's luck's another's poison. THE GIRL.  I ought to 'a waited.  I never thought he'd come back from the fightin'. THE MAN.  [Grimly]  Maybe 'e'd better not 'ave. THE GIRL.  [Looking back along the tow-path]  What'll he be like, I wonder? THE MAN.  [Gripping her shoulder]  Daisy, don't you never go back on me, or I should kill you, and 'im too.      [THE GIRL looks at him, shivers, and puts her lips to his.] THE GIRL.  I never could. THE MAN.  Will you run for it?  'E'd never find us!      [THE GIRL shakes her head.] THE MAN [Dully]  What's the good o' stayin'?  The world's wide. THE GIRL.  I'd rather have it off me mind, with him home. THE MAN.  [Clenching his hands]  It's temptin' Providence. THE GIRL.  What's the time, Jim? THE MAN.  [Glancing at the sun]  'Alf past four. THE GIRL.  [Looking along the towing-path]  He said four o'clock. Jim, you better go. THE MAN.  Not I.  I've not got the wind up.  I've seen as much of hell as he has, any day.  What like is he? THE GIRL.  [Dully]  I dunno, just.  I've not seen him these three years.  I dunno no more, since I've known you. THE MAN.  Big or little chap? THE GIRL.  'Bout your size.  Oh! Jim, go along! THE MAN.  No fear!  What's a blighter like that to old Fritz's shells?  We didn't shift when they was comin'.  If you'll go, I'll go; not else.      [Again she shakes her head.] THE GIRL.  Jim, do you love me true?      [For answer THE MAN takes her avidly in his arms.] I ain't ashamed--I ain't ashamed.  If 'e could see me 'eart. THE MAN.  Daisy!  If I'd known you out there, I never could 'a stuck it.  They'd 'a got me for a deserter.  That's how I love you! THE GIRL.  Jim, don't lift your hand to 'im!  Promise! THE MAN.  That's according. THE GIRL.  Promise! THE MAN.  If 'e keeps quiet, I won't.  But I'm not accountable--not always, I tell you straight--not since I've been through that. THE GIRL.  [With a shiver]  Nor p'raps he isn't. THE MAN.  Like as not.  It takes the lynch pins out, I tell you. THE GIRL.  God 'elp us! THE MAN.  [Grimly]  Ah!  We said that a bit too often.  What we want we take, now; there's no one else to give it us, and there's no fear'll stop us; we seen the bottom of things. THE GIRL.  P'raps he'll say that too. THE MAN.  Then it'll be 'im or me. THE GIRL.  I'm frightened: THE MAN.  [Tenderly]  No, Daisy, no!  The river's handy.  One more or less.  'E shan't 'arm you; nor me neither.  [He takes out a knife.] THE GIRL.  [Seizing his hand]  Oh, no!  Give it to me, Jim! THE MAN.  [Smiling]  No fear!  [He puts it away]  Shan't 'ave no need for it like as not.  All right, little Daisy; you can't be expected to see things like what we do.  What's life, anyway?  I've seen a thousand lives taken in five minutes.  I've seen dead men on the wires like flies on a flypaper.  I've been as good as dead meself a hundred times.  I've killed a dozen men.  It's nothin'.  He's safe, if 'e don't get my blood up.  If he does, nobody's safe; not 'im, nor anybody else; not even you.  I'm speakin' sober. THE GIRL.  [Softly]  Jim, you won't go fightin' in the sun, with the birds all callin'? THE MAN.  That depends on 'im.  I'm not lookin' for it.  Daisy, I love you.  I love your hair.  I love your eyes.  I love you. THE GIRL.  And I love you, Jim.  I don't want nothin' more than you in all the world. THE MAN.  Amen to that, my dear.  Kiss me close!      The sound of a voice singing breaks in on their embrace.  THE      GIRL starts from his arms, and looks behind her along the      towing-path.  THE MAN draws back against, the hedge, fingering      his side, where the knife is hidden.  The song comes nearer.                    "I'll be right there to-night,                     Where the fields are snowy white;                     Banjos ringing, darkies singing,                     All the world seems bright." THE GIRL.  It's him! THE MAN.  Don't get the wind up, Daisy.  I'm here!      [The singing stops.  A man's voice says "Christ!  It's Daisy;      it's little Daisy 'erself!"  THE GIRL stands rigid.  The figure      of a soldier appears on the other side of the stile.  His cap is      tucked into his belt, his hair is bright in the sunshine; he is      lean, wasted, brown, and laughing.] SOLDIER.  Daisy!  Daisy!  Hallo, old pretty girl!      [THE GIRL does not move, barring the way, as it were.] THE GIRL.  Hallo, Jack! [Softly]  I got things to tell you! SOLDIER.  What sort o' things, this lovely day?  Why, I got things that'd take me years to tell.  Have you missed me, Daisy? THE GIRL.  You been so long. SOLDIER.  So I 'ave.  My Gawd!  It's a way they 'ave in the Army.  I said when I got out of it I'd laugh.  Like as the sun itself I used to think of you, Daisy, when the trumps was comin' over, and the wind was up.  D'you remember that last night in the wood?  "Come back and marry me quick, Jack."  Well, here I am--got me pass to heaven.  No more fightin', no more drillin', no more sleepin' rough.  We can get married now, Daisy.  We can live soft an' 'appy.  Give us a kiss, my dear. THE GIRL.  [Drawing back]  No. SOLDIER.  [Blankly]  Why not?      [THE MAN, with a swift movement steps along the hedge to THE      GIRL'S side.] THE MAN.  That's why, soldier. SOLDIER.  [Leaping over the stile]  'Oo are you, Pompey?  The sun don't shine in your inside, do it?  'Oo is he, Daisy? THE GIRL.  My man. SOLDIER.  Your-man!  Lummy!  "Taffy was a Welshman, Taffy was a thief!"  Well, mate!  So you've been through it, too.  I'm laughin' this mornin' as luck will 'ave it.  Ah!  I can see your knife. THE MAN.  [Who has half drawn his knife]  Don't laugh at me, I tell you. SOLDIER.  Not at you, not at you.  [He looks from one to the other] I'm laughin' at things in general.  Where did you get it, mate? THE MAN.  [Watchfully]  Through the lung. SOLDIER.  Think o' that!  An' I never was touched.  Four years an' never was touched.  An' so you've come an' took my girl!  Nothin' doin'!  Ha!  [Again he looks from one to the other-then away]  Well! The world's before me!  [He laughs]  I'll give you Daisy for a lung protector. THE MAN.  [Fiercely]  You won't.  I've took her. SOLDIER.  That's all right, then.  You keep 'er.  I've got a laugh in me you can't put out, black as you look!  Good-bye, little Daisy!      [THE GIRL makes a movement towards him.] THE MAN.  Don't touch 'im!      [THE GIRL stands hesitating, and suddenly bursts into tears.] SOLDIER.  Look 'ere, mate; shake 'ands!  I don't want to see a girl cry, this day of all, with the sun shinin'.  I seen too much of sorrer.  You and me've been at the back of it.  We've 'ad our whack. Shake! THE MAN.  Who are you kiddin'?  You never loved 'er! SOLDIER.  [After a long moment's pause]  Oh!  I thought I did. THE MAN.  I'll fight you for her.      [He drops his knife. ] SOLDIER.  [Slowly]  Mate, you done your bit, an' I done mine.  It's took us two ways, seemin'ly. THE GIRL.  [Pleading]  Jim! THE MAN.  [With clenched fists]  I don't want 'is charity.  I only want what I can take. SOLDIER.  Daisy, which of us will you 'ave? THE GIRL.  [Covering her face]  Oh!  Him! SOLDIER.  You see, mate!  Put your 'ands down.  There's nothin' for it but a laugh.  You an' me know that.  Laugh, mate! THE MAN.  You blarsted----!      [THE GIRL springs to him and stops his mouth.] SOLDIER.  It's no use, mate.  I can't do it.  I said I'd laugh to-day, and laugh I will.  I've come through that, an' all the stink of it; I've come through sorrer.  Never again!  Cheerio, mate!  The sun's a-shinin'!  He turns away. THE GIRL.  Jack, don't think too 'ard of me! SOLDIER.  [Looking back]  No fear, my dear!  Enjoy your fancy!  So long!  Gawd bless you both! He sings, and goes along the path, and the song fades away.               "I'll be right there to-night                Where the fields are snowy white;                Banjos ringing, darkies singing                All the world seems bright!" THE MAN.  'E's mad! THE GIRL. [Looking down the path with her hands clasped]  The sun has touched 'im, Jim!                          CURTAIN PUNCH AND GO A Little Comedy      "Orpheus with his lute made trees      And the mountain tope that freeze....."      PERSONS OF THE PLAY      JAMES G. FRUST..............The Boss      E. BLEWITT VANE.............The Producer      MR. FORESON.................The Stage Manager      "ELECTRICS"..................The Electrician      "PROPS".....................The Property Man      HERBERT.....................The Call Boy      OF THE PLAY WITHIN THE PLAY      GUY TOONE...................The Professor      VANESSA HELLGROVE...........The Wife      GEORGE FLEETWAY.............Orpheus      MAUDE HOPKINS...............The Faun SCENE: The Stage of a Theatre. Action continuous, though the curtain is momentarily lowered according to that action.                          PUNCH AND GO      The Scene is the stage of the theatre set for the dress      rehearsal of the little play: "Orpheus with his Lute." The      curtain is up and the audience, though present, is not supposed      to be.  The set scene represents the end section of a room, with      wide French windows, Back Centre, fully opened on to an apple      orchard in bloom.  The Back Wall with these French windows, is      set only about ten feet from the footlights, and the rest of the      stage is orchard.  What is visible of the room would indicate      the study of a writing man of culture.  ( Note.--If found      advantageous for scenic purposes, this section of room can be      changed to a broad verandah or porch with pillars supporting its      roof.) In the wall, Stage Left, is a curtained opening, across      which the curtain is half drawn.  Stage Right of the French      windows is a large armchair turned rather towards the window,      with a book rest attached, on which is a volume of the      Encyclopedia Britannica, while on a stool alongside are writing      materials such as a man requires when he writes with a pad on      his knees.  On a little table close by is a reading-lamp with a      dark green shade.  A crude light from the floats makes the stage      stare; the only person on it is MR FORESON, the stage manager,      who is standing in the centre looking upwards as if waiting for      someone to speak.  He is a short, broad man, rather blank, and      fatal.  From the back of the auditorium, or from an empty box,      whichever is most convenient, the producer, MR BLEWITT VANE, a      man of about thirty four, with his hair brushed back, speaks. VANE.  Mr Foreson? FORESON.  Sir? VANE.  We'll do that lighting again.      [FORESON walks straight of the Stage into the wings Right.]      [A pause.] Mr Foreson!  [Crescendo]  Mr Foreson.      [FORESON walks on again from Right and shades his eyes.] VANE.  For goodness sake, stand by!  We'll do that lighting again. Check your floats. FORESON.  [Speaking up into the prompt wings]  Electrics! VOICE OF ELECTRICS.  Hallo! FORESON.  Give it us again.  Check your floats.      [The floats go down, and there is a sudden blinding glare of      blue lights, in which FORESON looks particularly ghastly.] VANE.  Great Scott!  What the blazes!  Mr Foreson!      [FORESON walks straight out into the wings Left.  Crescendo.] Mr Foreson! FORESON.  [Re-appearing]  Sir? VANE.  Tell Miller to come down. FORESON.  Electrics!  Mr Blewitt Vane wants to speak to you.  Come down! VANE.  Tell Herbert to sit in that chair.      [FORESON walks straight out into the Right wings.] Mr Foreson! FORESON.  [Re-appearing]  Sir? VANE.  Don't go off the stage.  [FORESON mutters.]      [ELECTRICS appears from the wings, Stage Left.  He is a dark,      thin-faced man with rather spikey hair.] ELECTRICS.  Yes, Mr Vane? VANE.  Look! ELECTRICS.  That's what I'd got marked, Mr Vane. VANE.  Once for all, what I want is the orchard in full moonlight, and the room dark except for the reading lamp.  Cut off your front battens.      [ELECTRICS withdraws Left.  FORESON walks off the Stage into the      Right wings.] Mr Foreson! FORESON.  [Re-appearing]  Sir? VANE.  See this marked right.  Now, come on with it!  I want to get some beauty into this!      [While he is speaking, HERBERT, the call boy, appears from the      wings Right, a mercurial youth of about sixteen with a wide      mouth.] FORESON.  [Maliciously]  Here you are, then, Mr Vane.  Herbert, sit in that chair.      [HERBERT sits an the armchair, with an air of perfect peace.] VANE.  Now!  [All the lights go out.  In a wail]  Great Scott!      [A throaty chuckle from FORESON in the darkness.  The light      dances up, flickers, shifts, grows steady, falling on the      orchard outside.  The reading lamp darts alight and a piercing      little glare from it strikes into the auditorium away from      HERBERT.] [In a terrible voice]  Mr Foreson. FORESON.  Sir? VANE.  Look--at--that--shade!      [FORESON mutters, walks up to it and turns it round so that the      light shines on HERBERT'S legs.] On his face, on his face!      [FORESON turns the light accordingly.] FORESON.  Is that what you want, Mr Vane? VANE.  Yes.  Now, mark that! FORESON.  [Up into wings Right]  Electrics! ELECTRICS.  Hallo! FORESON.  Mark that! VANE.  My God!      [The blue suddenly becomes amber.]      [The blue returns.  All is steady.  HERBERT is seen diverting      himself with an imaginary cigar.] Mr Foreson. FORESON.  Sir? VANE.  Ask him if he's got that? FORESON.  Have you got that? ELECTRICS.  Yes. VANE.  Now pass to the change.  Take your floats off altogether. FORESON.  [Calling up]  Floats out.  [They go out.] VANE.  Cut off that lamp.  [The lamp goes out]  Put a little amber in your back batten.  Mark that!  Now pass to the end.  Mr Foreson! FORESON.  Sir? VANE.  Black out FORESON.  [Calling up]  Black out!      [The lights go out.] VANE.  Give us your first lighting-lamp on.  And then the two changes.  Quick as you can.   Put some pep into it.  Mr Foreson! FORESON.  Sir? VANE.  Stand for me where Miss Hellgrove comes in.  FORESON crosses to the window.  No, no!--by the curtain.      [FORESON takes his stand by the curtain; and suddenly the three      lighting effects are rendered quickly and with miraculous      exactness.] Good!  Leave it at that.  We'll begin.  Mr Foreson, send up to Mr Frust.      [He moves from the auditorium and ascends on to the Stage, by      some steps Stage Right.] FORESON.  Herb!  Call the boss, and tell beginners to stand by. Sharp, now!      [HERBERT gets out of the chair, and goes off Right.]      [FORESON is going off Left as VANE mounts the Stage.] VANE.  Mr Foreson. FORESON.  [Re-appearing]  Sir? VANE.  I want "Props." FORESON.  [In a stentorian voice]  "Props!"      [Another moth-eaten man appears through the French windows.] VANE.  Is that boulder firm? PROPS.  [Going to where, in front of the back-cloth, and apparently among its apple trees, lies the counterfeitment of a mossy boulder; he puts his foot on it]  If, you don't put too much weight on it, sir. VANE.  It won't creak? PROPS.  Nao.  [He mounts on it, and a dolorous creaking arises.] VANE.  Make that right.  Let me see that lute.      [PROPS produces a property lute.  While they scrutinize it, a      broad man with broad leathery clean-shaven face and small mouth,      occupied by the butt end of a cigar, has come on to the stage      from Stage Left, and stands waiting to be noticed.] PROPS.  [Attracted by the scent of the cigar]  The Boss, Sir. VANE.  [Turning to "PROPS"]  That'll do, then.      ["PROPS" goes out through the French windows.] VANE.  [To FRUST]  Now, sir, we're all ready for rehearsal of "Orpheus with his Lute." FRUST.  [In a cosmopolitan voice]  "Orphoos with his loot!"  That his loot, Mr Vane?  Why didn't he pinch something more precious?  Has this high-brow curtain-raiser of yours got any "pep" in it? VANE.  It has charm. FRUST.  I'd thought of "Pop goes the Weasel" with little Miggs.  We kind of want a cock-tail before "Louisa loses," Mr Vane. VANE.  Well, sir, you'll see. FRUST.  This your lighting?  It's a bit on the spiritool side.  I've left my glass.  Guess I'll sit in the front row.  Ha'f a minute.  Who plays this Orphoos? VANE.  George Fleetway. FRUST.  Has he got punch? VANE.  It's a very small part. FRUST.  Who are the others? VANE.  Guy Toone plays the Professor; Vanessa Hellgrove his wife; Maude Hopkins the faun. FRUST.  H'm!  Names don't draw. VANE.  They're not expensive, any of them.  Miss Hellgrove's a find, I think. FRUST.  Pretty? VANE.  Quite. FRUST.  Arty? VANE.  [Doubtfully]  No.  [With resolution]  Look here, Mr FRUST, it's no use your expecting another "Pop goes the Weasel." FRUST.  We-ell, if it's got punch and go, that'll be enough for me. Let's get to it!      [He extinguishes his cigar and descends the steps and sits in      the centre of the front row of the stalls.] VANE.  Mr Foreson? FORESON.  [Appearing through curtain, Right]  Sir? VANE.  Beginners.  Take your curtain down.      [He descends the steps and seats himself next to FRUST.  The      curtain goes down.]      [A woman's voice is heard singing very beautifully Sullivan's      song: "Orpheus with his lute, with his lute made trees and the      mountain tops that freeze'." etc.] FRUST.  Some voice!      The curtain rises. In the armchair the PROFESSOR is yawning,      tall, thin, abstracted, and slightly grizzled in the hair.  He      has a pad of paper over his knee, ink on the stool to his right      and the Encyclopedia volume on the stand to his left-barricaded      in fact by the article he is writing.  He is reading a page over      to himself, but the words are drowned in the sound of the song      his WIFE is singing in the next room, partly screened off by the      curtain.  She finishes, and stops.  His voice can then be heard      conning the words of his article. PROF.  "Orpheus symbolized the voice of Beauty, the call of life, luring us mortals with his song back from the graves we dig for ourselves.  Probably the ancients realized this neither more nor less than we moderns.  Mankind has not changed.  The civilized being still hides the faun and the dryad within its broadcloth and its silk.  And yet"--[He stops, with a dried-up air-rather impatiently]  Go on, my dear!  It helps the atmosphere.      [The voice of his WIFE begins again, gets as far as "made them      sing" and stops dead, just as the PROFESSOR's pen is beginning      to scratch.  And suddenly, drawing the curtain further aside]      [SHE appears.  Much younger than the PROFESSOR, pale, very      pretty, of a Botticellian type in face, figure, and in her      clinging cream-coloured frock.  She gazes at her abstracted      husband; then swiftly moves to the lintel of the open window,      and stands looking out.] THE WIFE.  God!  What beauty! PROF.  [Looking Up]  Umm? THE WIFE.  I said: God!  What beauty! PROF.  Aha! THE WIFE.  [Looking at him]  Do you know that I have to repeat everything to you nowadays? PROF.  What? THE WIFE.  That I have to repeat---- PROF.  Yes; I heard.  I'm sorry.  I get absorbed. THE WIFE.  In all but me. PROF.  [Startled]  My dear, your song was helping me like anything to get the mood.  This paper is the very deuce--to balance between the historical and the natural. THE WIFE.  Who wants the natural? PROF.  [Grumbling]  Umm!  Wish I thought that!  Modern taste! History may go hang; they're all for tuppence-coloured sentiment nowadays. THE WIFE.  [As if to herself]  Is the Spring sentiment? PROF.  I beg your pardon, my dear; I didn't catch. WIFE.  [As if against her will--urged by some pent-up force]  Beauty, beauty! PROF.  That's what I'm, trying to say here.  The Orpheus legend symbolizes to this day the call of Beauty!  [He takes up his pen, while she continues to stare out at the moonlight.  Yawning]  Dash it!  I get so sleepy; I wish you'd tell them to make the after-dinner coffee twice as strong. WIFE.  I will. PROF.  How does this strike you?  [Conning]  "Many Renaissance pictures, especially those of Botticelli, Francesca and Piero di Cosimo were inspired by such legends as that of Orpheus, and we owe a tiny gem--like Raphael 'Apollo and Marsyas' to the same Pagan inspiration." WIFE.  We owe it more than that--rebellion against the dry-as-dust. PROF.  Quite.  I might develop that: "We owe it our revolt against the academic; or our disgust at 'big business,' and all the grossness of commercial success.  We owe----".  [His voice peters out.] WIFE.  It--love. PROF.  [Abstracted]  Eh! WIFE.  I said: We owe it love. PROF.  [Rather startled]  Possibly.  But--er  [With a dry smile] I mustn't say that here--hardly! WIFE.  [To herself and the moonlight]  Orpheus with his lute! PROF.  Most people think a lute is a sort of flute.  [Yawning heavily]  My dear, if you're not going to sing again, d'you mind sitting down?  I want to concentrate. WIFE.  I'm going out. PROF.  Mind the dew! WIFE.  The Christian virtues and the dew. PROF.  [With a little dry laugh]  Not bad!  Not bad!  The Christian virtues and the dew.  [His hand takes up his pen, his face droops over his paper, while his wife looks at him with a very strange face] "How far we can trace the modern resurgence against the Christian virtues to the symbolic figures of Orpheus, Pan, Apollo, and Bacchus might be difficult to estimate, but----"      [During those words his WIFE has passed through the window into      the moonlight, and her voice rises, singing as she goes:      "Orpheus with his lute, with his lute made trees..."] PROF.  [Suddenly aware of something]  She'll get her throat bad. [He is silent as the voice swells in the distance]  Sounds queer at night-H'm!  [He is silent--Yawning.  The voice dies away.  Suddenly his head nods; he fights his drowsiness; writes a word or two, nods again, and in twenty seconds is asleep.]      [The Stage is darkened by a black-out.  FRUST's voice is heard      speaking.] FRUST.  What's that girl's name? VANE.  Vanessa Hellgrove. FRUST.  Aha!      [The Stage is lighted up again.  Moonlight bright on the      orchard; the room in darkness where the PROFESSOR'S figure is      just visible sleeping in the chair, and screwed a little more      round towards the window.  From behind the mossy boulder a      faun-like figure uncurls itself and peeps over with ears      standing up and elbows leaning on the stone, playing a rustic      pipe; and there are seen two rabbits and a fox sitting up and      listening.  A shiver of wind passes, blowing petals from the      apple-trees.]      [The FAUN darts his head towards where, from Right, comes slowly      the figure of a Greek youth, holding a lute or lyre which his      fingers strike, lifting out little wandering strains as of wind      whinnying in funnels and odd corners.  The FAUN darts down      behind the stone, and the youth stands by the boulder playing      his lute.  Slowly while he plays the whitened trunk of an      apple-tree is seen, to dissolve into the body of a girl with      bare arms and feet, her dark hair unbound, and the face of the      PROFESSOR'S WIFE.  Hypnotized, she slowly sways towards him,      their eyes fixed on each other, till she is quite close.  Her      arms go out to him, cling round his neck and, their lips meet.      But as they meet there comes a gasp and the PROFESSOR with      rumpled hair is seen starting from his chair, his hands thrown      up; and at his horrified "Oh!" the Stage is darkened with a      black-out.]      [The voice of FRUST is heard speaking.] FRUST.  Gee!      The Stage is lighted up again, as in the opening scene.  The      PROFESSOR is seen in his chair, with spilt sheets of paper round      him, waking from a dream.  He shakes himself, pinches his leg,      stares heavily round into the moonlight, rises. PROF.  Phew!  Beastly dream!  Boof!  H'm!  [He moves to the window and calls.]  Blanche!  Blanche!  [To himself]  Made trees-made trees! [Calling]  Blanche! WIFE's VOICE.  Yes. PROF.  Where are you? WIFE.  [Appearing by the stone with her hair down]  Here! PROF.  I say--I---I've been asleep--had a dream.  Come in.  I'll tell you.      [She comes, and they stand in the window.] PROF.  I dreamed I saw a-faun on that boulder blowing on a pipe.  [He looks nervously at the stone]  With two damned little rabbits and a fox sitting up and listening.  And then from out there came our friend Orpheus playing on his confounded lute, till he actually turned that tree there into you.  And gradually he-he drew you like a snake till you--er--put your arms round his neck and--er--kissed him. Boof!  I woke up.  Most unpleasant.  Why!  Your hair's down! WIFE.  Yes. PROF.  Why? WIFE.  It was no dream.  He was bringing me to life. PROF.  What on earth? WIFE.  Do you suppose I am alive?  I'm as dead as Euridice. PROF.  Good heavens, Blanche, what's the matter with you to-night? WIFE.  [Pointing to the litter of papers]  Why don't we live, instead of writing of it?  [She points out unto the moonlight]  What do we get out of life?  Money, fame, fashion, talk, learning?  Yes.  And what good are they?  I want to live! PROF.  [Helplessly]  My dear, I really don't know what you mean. WIFE.  [Pointing out into the moonlight]  Look!  Orpheus with his lute, and nobody can see him.  Beauty, beauty, beauty--we let it go. [With sudden passion]  Beauty, love, the spring.  They should be in us, and they're all outside. PROF.  My dear, this is--this is--awful.  [He tries to embrace her.] WIFE.  [Avoiding him--an a stilly voice]  Oh!  Go on with your writing! PROF.  I'm--I'm upset.  I've never known you so--so---- WIFE.  Hysterical?  Well!  It's over.  I'll go and sing. PROF.  [Soothingly]  There, there!  I'm sorry, darling; I really am. You're kipped--you're kipped.  [He gives and she accepts a kiss] Better?      [He gravitates towards his papers.] All right, now? WIFE.  [Standing still and looking at him]  Quite! PROF.  Well, I'll try and finish this to-night; then, to-morrow we might have a jaunt.  How about a theatre?  There's a thing--they say --called "Chinese Chops," that's been running years. WIFE.  [Softly to herself as he settles down into his chair]  Oh! God!      [While he takes up a sheet of paper and adjusts himself, she      stands at the window staring with all her might at the boulder,      till from behind it the faun's head and shoulders emerge once      more.] PROF.  Very queer the power suggestion has over the mind.  Very queer!  There's nothing really in animism, you know, except the curious shapes rocks, trees and things take in certain lights--effect they have on our imagination.  [He looks up]  What's the matter now? WIFE.  [Startled]  Nothing!  Nothing!      [Her eyes waver to him again, and the FAUN vanishes.  She turns      again to look at the boulder; there is nothing there; a little      shiver of wind blows some petals off the trees.  She catches one      of them, and turning quickly, goes out through the curtain.] PROF.  [Coming to himself and writing]  "The Orpheus legend is the-- er--apotheosis of animism.  Can we accept----" [His voice is lost in the sound of his WIFE'S voice beginning again: "Orpheus with his lute--with his lute made trees----" It dies in a sob.  The PROFESSOR looks up startled, as the curtain falls]. FRUST.  Fine!  Fine! VANE.  Take up the curtain.  Mr Foreson?      [The curtain goes up.] FORESON.  Sir? VANE.  Everybody on.      [He and FRUST leave their seats and ascend on to the Stage, on      which are collecting the four Players.] VANE.  Give us some light. FORESON.  Electrics!  Turn up your floats!      [The footlights go up, and the blue goes out; the light is crude      as at the beginning.] FRUST.  I'd like to meet Miss Hellgrove.  [She comes forward eagerly and timidly.  He grasps her hand]  Miss Hellgrove, I want to say I thought that fine--fine.  [Her evident emotion and pleasure warm him so that he increases his grasp and commendation]  Fine.  It quite got my soft spots.  Emotional.  Fine! MISS H.  Oh!  Mr Frust; it means so much to me.  Thank you! FRUST.  [A little balder in the eye, and losing warmth]  Er--fine! [His eye wanders]  Where's Mr Flatway? VANE.  Fleetway.      [FLEETWAY comes up.] FRUST.  Mr Fleetway, I want to say I thought your Orphoos very remarkable.  Fine. FLEETWAY.  Thank you, sir, indeed--so glad you liked it. FRUST.  [A little balder in the eye]  There wasn't much to it, but what there was was fine.  Mr Toone.      [FLEETWAY melts out and TOONE is precipitated.] Mr Toone, I was very pleased with your Professor--quite a character-study.  [TOONE bows and murmurs]  Yes, sir!  I thought it fine.  [His eye grows bald]  Who plays the goat? MISS HOPK.  [Appearing suddenly between the windows]  I play the faun, Mr Frost. FORESON.  [Introducing]  Miss Maude 'Opkins. FRUST.  Miss Hopkins, I guess your fawn was fine. MISS HOPK.  Oh! Thank you, Mr Frost.  How nice of you to say so.  I do so enjoy playing him. FRUST.  [His eye growing bald]  Mr Foreson, I thought the way you fixed that tree was very cunning; I certainly did.  Got a match?      [He takes a match from FORESON, and lighting a very long cigar,      walks up Stage through the French windows followed by FORESON,      and examines the apple-tree.]      [The two Actors depart, but Miss HELLGROVE runs from where she      has been lingering, by the curtain, to VANE, Stage Right.] MISS H.  Oh!  Mr Vane--do you think?  He seemed quite--Oh!  Mr Vane [ecstatically]  If only---- VANE.  [Pleased and happy]  Yes, yes.  All right--you were splendid. He liked it.  He quite---- MISS H.  [Clasping her hand]  How wonderful Oh, Mr Vane, thank you!      [She clasps his hands; but suddenly, seeing that FRUST is coming      back, fits across into the curtain and vanishes.]      [The Stage, in the crude light, as empty now save for FRUST,      who, in the French windows, Centre, is mumbling his cigar; and      VANE, Stage Right, who is looking up into the wings, Stage      Left.] VANE.  [Calling up]  That lighting's just right now, Miller.  Got it marked carefully? ELECTRICS.  Yes, Mr Vane. VANE.  Good.  [To FRUST who as coming down]  Well, sir?  So glad---- FRUST.  Mr Vane, we got little Miggs on contract? VANE.  Yes. FRUST.  Well, I liked that little pocket piece fine.  But I'm blamed if I know what it's all about. VANE.  [A little staggered]  Why!  Of course it's a little allegory. The tragedy of civilization--all real feeling for Beauty and Nature kept out, or pent up even in the cultured. FRUST.  Ye-ep.  [Meditatively]  Little Miggs'd be fine in "Pop goes the Weasel." VANE.  Yes, he'd be all right, but---- FRUST.  Get him on the 'phone, and put it into rehearsal right now. VANE.  What!  But this piece--I--I----! FRUST.  Guess we can't take liberties with our public, Mr Vane.  They want pep. VANE.  [Distressed]  But it'll break that girl's heart.  I--really--I can't---- FRUST.  Give her the part of the 'tweeny in "Pop goes". VANE.  Mr Frust, I--I beg.  I've taken a lot of trouble with this little play.  It's good.  It's that girl's chance--and I---- FRUST.  We-ell!  I certainly thought she was fine.  Now, you 'phone up Miggs, and get right along with it.  I've only one rule, sir! Give the Public what it wants; and what the Public wants is punch and go.  They've got no use for Beauty, Allegory, all that high-brow racket.  I know 'em as I know my hand.      [During this speech MISS HELLGROVE is seen listening by the      French window, in distress, unnoticed by either of them.] VANE.  Mr Frost, the Public would take this, I'm sure they would; I'm convinced of it.  You underrate them. FRUST.  Now, see here, Mr Blewitt Vane, is this my theatre?  I tell you, I can't afford luxuries. VANE.  But it--it moved you, sir; I saw it.  I was watching. FRUST.  [With unmoved finality]  Mr Vane, I judge I'm not the average man.  Before "Louisa Loses" the Public'll want a stimulant.  "Pop goes the Weasel" will suit us fine.  So--get right along with it. I'll go get some lunch.      [As he vanishes into the wings, Left, MISS HELLGROVE covers her      face with her hands.  A little sob escaping her attracts VANE'S      attention.  He takes a step towards her, but she flies.] VANE.  [Dashing his hands through his hair till it stands up] Damnation!      [FORESON walks on from the wings, Right.] FORESON.  Sir? VANE.  "Punch and go!" That superstition!      [FORESON walks straight out into the wings, Left.] VANE.  Mr Foreson! FORESON.  [Re-appearing]  Sir? VANE.  This is scrapped.  [With savagery]  Tell 'em to set the first act of "Louisa Loses," and put some pep into it.      [He goes out through the French windows with the wind still in      his hair.] FORESON.  [In the centre of the Stage]  Electrics! ELECTRICS.  Hallo! FORESON.  Where's Charlie? ELECTRICS.  Gone to his dinner. FORESON.  Anybody on the curtain? A VOICE.  Yes, Mr Foreson. FORESON.  Put your curtain down.      [He stands in the centre of the Stage with eyes uplifted as the      curtain descends.] THE END

V. PERIER Paris: 1825. Those who have attended to the practice of our literary tribunal are well aware that, by means of certain legal fictions similar to those of Westminster Hall, we are frequently enabled to take cognisance of cases lying beyond the sphere of our original jurisdiction. We need hardly say, therefore, that in the present instance M. Perier is merely a Richard Roe, who will not be mentioned in any subsequent stage of the proceedings, and whose name is used for the sole purpose of bringing Machiavelli into court. We doubt whether any name in literary history be so generally odious as that of the man whose character and writings we now propose to consider. The terms in which he is commonly described would seem to import that he was the Tempter, the Evil Principle, the discoverer of ambition and revenge, the original inventor of perjury, and that, before the publication of his fatal Prince, there had never been a hypocrite, a tyrant, or a traitor, a simulated virtue, or a convenient crime. One writer gravely assures us that Maurice of Saxony learned all his fraudulent policy from that execrable volume. Another remarks that since it was translated into Turkish, the Sultans have been more addicted than formerly to the custom of strangling their brothers. Lord Lyttelton charges the poor Florentine with the manifold treasons of the house of Guise, and with the massacre of St. Bartholomew. Several authors have hinted that the Gunpowder Plot is to be primarily attributed to his doctrines, and seem to think that his effigy ought to be substituted for that of Guy Faux, in those processions by which the ingenious youth of England annually commemorate the preservation of the Three Estates. The Church of Rome has pronounced his works accursed things. Nor have our own countrymen been backward in testifying their opinion of his merits. Out of his surname they have coined an epithet for a knave, and out of his Christian name a synonym for the Devil. [Nick Machiavel had ne'er a trick, Tho' he gave his name to our old Nick. Hudibras, Part iii. Canto i. But, we believe, there is a schism on this subject among the antiquarians.] It is indeed scarcely possible for any person, not well acquainted with the history and literature of Italy, to read without horror and amazement the celebrated treatise which has brought so much obloquy on the name of Machiavelli. Such a display of wickedness, naked yet not ashamed, such cool, judicious, scientific atrocity, seemed rather to belong to a fiend than to the most depraved of men. Principles which the most hardened ruffian would scarcely hint to his most trusted accomplice, or avow, without the disguise of some palliating sophism, even to his own mind, are professed without the slightest circumlocution, and assumed as the fundamental axioms of all political science. It is not strange that ordinary readers should regard the author of such a book as the most depraved and shameless of human beings. Wise men, however, have always been inclined to look with great suspicion on the angels and daemons of the multitude: and in the present instance, several circumstances have led even superficial observers to question the justice of the vulgar decision. It is notorious that Machiavelli was, through life, a zealous republican. In the same year in which he composed his manual of King-craft, he suffered imprisonment and torture in the cause of public liberty. It seems inconceivable that the martyr of freedom should have designedly acted as the apostle of tyranny. Several eminent writers have, therefore, endeavoured to detect in this unfortunate performance some concealed meaning, more consistent with the character and conduct of the author than that which appears at the first glance. One hypothesis is that Machiavelli intended to practise on the young Lorenzo de Medici a fraud similar to that which Sunderland is said to have employed against our James the Second, and that he urged his pupil to violent and perfidious measures, as the surest means of accelerating the moment of deliverance and revenge. Another supposition which Lord Bacon seems to countenance, is that the treatise was merely a piece of grave irony, intended to warn nations against the arts of ambitious men. It would be easy to show that neither of these solutions is consistent with many passages in The Prince itself. But the most decisive refutation is that which is furnished by the other works of Machiavelli. In all the writings which he gave to the public, and in all those which the research of editors has, in the course of three centuries, discovered, in his Comedies, designed for the entertainment of the multitude, in his Comments on Livy, intended for the perusal of the most enthusiastic patriots of Florence, in his History, inscribed to one of the most amiable and estimable of the Popes, in his public despatches, in his private memoranda, the same obliquity of moral principle for which The Prince is so severely censured is more or less discernible. We doubt whether it would be possible to find, in all the many volumes of his compositions, a single expression indicating that dissimulation and treachery had ever struck him as discreditable. After this, it may seem ridiculous to say that we are acquainted with few writings which exhibit so much elevation of sentiment, so pure and warm a zeal for the public good, or so just a view of the duties and rights of citizens, as those of Machiavelli. Yet so it is. And even from The Prince itself we could select many passages in support of this remark. To a reader of our age and country this inconsistency is, at first, perfectly bewildering. The whole man seems to be an enigma, a grotesque assemblage of incongruous qualities, selfishness and generosity, cruelty and benevolence, craft and simplicity, abject villainy and romantic heroism. One sentence is such as a veteran diplomatist would scarcely write in cipher for the direction of his most confidential spy; the next seems to be extracted from a theme composed by an ardent schoolboy on the death of Leonidas. An act of dexterous perfidy, and an act of patriotic self-devotion, call forth the same kind and the same degree of respectful admiration. The moral sensibility of the writer seems at once to be morbidly obtuse and morbidly acute. Two characters altogether dissimilar are united in him. They are not merely joined, but interwoven. They are the warp and the woof of his mind; and their combination, like that of the variegated threads in shot silk, gives to the whole texture a glancing and ever-changing appearance. The explanation might have been easy, if he had been a very weak or a very affected man. But he was evidently neither the one nor the other. His works prove, beyond all contradiction, that his understanding was strong, his taste pure, and his sense of the ridiculous exquisitely keen. This is strange: and yet the strangest is behind. There is no reason whatever to think, that those amongst whom he lived saw anything shocking or incongruous in his writings. Abundant proofs remain of the high estimation in which both his works and his person were held by the most respectable among his contemporaries. Clement the Seventh patronised the publication of those very books which the Council of Trent, in the following generation, pronounced unfit for the perusal of Christians. Some members of the democratical party censured the Secretary for dedicating The Prince to a patron who bore the unpopular name of Medici. But to those immoral doctrines which have since called forth such severe reprehensions no exception appears to have been taken. The cry against them was first raised beyond the Alps, and seems to have been heard with amazement in Italy. The earliest assailant, as far as we are aware, was a countryman of our own, Cardinal Pole. The author of the Anti-Machiavelli was a French Protestant. It is, therefore, in the state of moral feeling among the Italians of those times that we must seek for the real explanation of what seems most mysterious in the life and writings of this remarkable man. As this is a subject which suggests many interesting considerations, both political and metaphysical, we shall make no apology for discussing it at some length. During the gloomy and disastrous centuries which followed the downfall of the Roman Empire, Italy had preserved, in a far greater degree than any other part of Western Europe, the traces of ancient civilisation. The night which descended upon her was the night of an Arctic summer. The dawn began to reappear before the last reflection of the preceding sunset had faded from the horizon. It was in the time of the French Merovingians and of the Saxon Heptarchy that ignorance and ferocity seemed to have done their worst. Yet even then the Neapolitan provinces, recognising the authority of the Eastern Empire, preserved something of Eastern knowledge and refinement. Rome, protected by the sacred character of her Pontiffs, enjoyed at least comparative security and repose, Even in those regions where the sanguinary Lombards had fixed their monarchy, there was incomparably more of wealth, of information, of physical comfort, and of social order, than could be found in Gaul, Britain, or Germany. That which most distinguished Italy from the neighbouring countries was the importance which the population of the towns, at a very early period, began to acquire. Some cities had been founded in wild and remote situations, by fugitives who had escaped from the rage of the barbarians. Such were Venice and Genoa, which preserved their freedom by their obscurity, till they became able to preserve it by their power. Other cities seem to have retained, under all the changing dynasties of invaders, under Odoacer and Theodoric, Narses and Alboin, the municipal institutions which had been conferred on them by the liberal policy of the Great Republic. In provinces which the central government was too feeble either to protect or to oppress, these institutions gradually acquired stability and vigour. The citizens, defended by their walls, and governed by their own magistrates and their own by-laws, enjoyed a considerable share of republican independence. Thus a strong democratic spirit was called into action. The Carlovingian sovereigns were too imbecile to subdue it. The generous policy of Otho encouraged it. It might perhaps have been suppressed by a close coalition between the Church and the Empire. It was fostered and invigorated by their disputes. In the twelfth century it attained its full vigour, and, after a long and doubtful conflict, triumphed over the abilities and courage of the Swabian princes. The assistance of the Ecclesiastical power had greatly contributed to the success of the Guelfs. That success would, however, have been a doubtful good, if its only effect had been to substitute a moral for a political servitude, and to exalt the Popes at the expense of the Caesars. Happily the public mind of Italy had long contained the seeds of free opinions, which were now rapidly developed by the genial influence of free institutions. The people of that country had observed the whole machinery of the Church, its saints and its miracles, its lofty pretensions and its splendid ceremonial, its worthless blessings and its harmless curses, too long and too closely to be duped. They stood behind the scenes on which others were gazing with childish awe and interest. They witnessed the arrangement of the pulleys, and the manufacture of the thunders. They saw the natural faces and heard the natural voices of the actors. Distant nations looked on the Pope as the Vicegerent of the Almighty, the oracle of the All-wise, the umpire from whose decisions, in the disputes either of theologians or of kings, no Christian ought to appeal. The Italians were acquainted with all the follies of his youth, and with all the dishonest arts by which he had attained power. They knew how often he had employed the keys of the Church to release himself from the most sacred engagements, and its wealth to pamper his mistresses and nephews. The doctrines and rites of the established religion they treated with decent reverence. But though they still called themselves Catholics, they had ceased to be Papists. Those spiritual arms which carried terror into the palaces and camps of the proudest sovereigns excited only contempt in the immediate neighbourhood of the Vatican. Alexander, when he commanded our Henry the Second to submit to the lash before the tomb of a rebellious subject, was himself an exile. The Romans apprehending that he entertained designs against their liberties, had driven him from their city; and though he solemnly promised to confine himself for the future to his spiritual functions, they still refused to readmit him. In every other part of Europe, a large and powerful privileged class trampled on the people and defied the Government. But in the most flourishing parts of Italy, the feudal nobles were reduced to comparative insignificance. In some districts they took shelter under the protection of the powerful commonwealths which they were unable to oppose, and gradually sank into the mass of burghers. In other places they possessed great influence; but it was an influence widely different from that which was exercised by the aristocracy of any Transalpine kingdom. They were not petty princes, but eminent citizens. Instead of strengthening their fastnesses among the mountains, they embellished their palaces in the market-place. The state of society in the Neapolitan dominions, and in some parts of the Ecclesiastical State, more nearly resembled that which existed in the great monarchies of Europe. But the Governments of Lombardy and Tuscany, through all their revolutions, preserved a different character. A people, when assembled in a town, is far more formidable to its rulers than when dispersed over a wide extent of country. The most arbitrary of the Caesars found it necessary to feed and divert the inhabitants of their unwieldy capital at the expense of the provinces. The citizens of Madrid have more than once besieged their sovereign in his own palace, and extorted from him the most humiliating concessions. The Sultans have often been compelled to propitiate the furious rabble of Constantinople with the head of an unpopular Vizier. From the same cause there was a certain tinge of democracy in the monarchies and aristocracies of Northern Italy. Thus liberty, partially indeed and transiently, revisited Italy; and with liberty came commerce and empire, science and taste, all the comforts and all the ornaments of life. The Crusades, from which the inhabitants of other countries gained nothing but relics and wounds, brought to the rising commonwealths of the Adriatic and Tyrrhene seas a large increase of wealth, dominion, and knowledge. The moral and geographical position of those commonwealths enabled them to profit alike by the barbarism of the West and by the civilisation of the East. Italian ships covered every sea. Italian factories rose on every shore. The tables of Italian moneychangers were set in every city. Manufactures flourished. Banks were established. The operations of the commercial machine were facilitated by many useful and beautiful inventions. We doubt whether any country of Europe, our own excepted, have at the present time reached so high a point of wealth and civilisation as some parts of Italy had attained four hundred years ago. Historians rarely descend to those details from which alone the real state of a community can be collected. Hence posterity is too often deceived by the vague hyperboles of poets and rhetoricians, who mistake the splendour of a court for the happiness of a people. Fortunately, John Villani has given us an ample and precise account of the state of Florence in the early part of the fourteenth century. The revenue of the Republic amounted to three hundred thousand florins; a sum which, allowing for the depreciation of the precious metals, was at least equivalent to six hundred thousand pounds sterling; a larger sum than England and Ireland, two centuries ago, yielded annually to Elizabeth. The manufacture of wool alone employed two hundred factories and thirty thousand workmen. The cloth annually produced sold, at an average, for twelve hundred thousand florins; a sum fully equal in exchangeable value to two millions and a half of our money. Four hundred thousand florins were annually coined. Eighty banks conducted the commercial operations, not of Florence only but of all Europe. The transactions of these establishments were sometimes of a magnitude which may surprise even the contemporaries of the Barings and the Rothschilds. Two houses advanced to Edward the Third of England upwards of three hundred thousand marks, at a time when the mark contained more silver than fifty shillings of the present day, and when the value of silver was more than quadruple of what it now is. The city and its environs contained a hundred and seventy thousand inhabitants. In the various schools about ten thousand children were taught to read; twelve hundred studied arithmetic; six hundred received a learned education. The progress of elegant literature and of the fine arts was proportioned to that of the public prosperity. Under the despotic successors of Augustus, all the fields of intellect had been turned into arid wastes, still marked out by formal boundaries, still retaining the traces of old cultivation, but yielding neither flowers nor fruit. The deluge of barbarism came. It swept away all the landmarks. It obliterated all the signs of former tillage. But it fertilised while it devastated. When it receded, the wilderness was as the garden of God, rejoicing on every side, laughing, clapping its hands, pouring forth, in spontaneous abundance, everything brilliant, or fragrant, or nourishing. A new language, characterised by simple sweetness and simple energy, had attained perfection. No tongue ever furnished more gorgeous and vivid tints to poetry; nor was it long before a poet appeared who knew how to employ them. Early in the fourteenth century came forth the Divine Comedy, beyond comparison the greatest work of imagination which had appeared since the poems of Homer. The following generation produced indeed no second Dante: but it was eminently distinguished by general intellectual activity. The study of the Latin writers had never been wholly neglected in Italy. But Petrarch introduced a more profound, liberal, and elegant scholarship, and communicated to his countrymen that enthusiasm for the literature, the history, and the antiquities of Rome, which divided his own heart with a frigid mistress and a more frigid Muse. Boccaccio turned their attention to the more sublime and graceful models of Greece. From this time, the admiration of learning and genius became almost an idolatry among the people of Italy. Kings and republics, cardinals and doges, vied with each other in honouring and flattering Petrarch. Embassies from rival States solicited the honour of his instructions. His coronation agitated the Court of Naples and the people of Rome as much as the most important political transaction could have done. To collect books and antiques, to found professorships, to patronise men of learning, became almost universal fashions among the great. The spirit of literary research allied itself to that of commercial enterprise. Every place to which the merchant princes of Florence extended their gigantic traffic, from the bazars of the Tigris to the monasteries of the Clyde, was ransacked for medals and manuscripts. Architecture, painting, and sculpture, were munificently encouraged. Indeed it would be difficult to name an Italian of eminence, during the period of which we speak, who, whatever may have been his general character, did not at least affect a love of letters and of the arts. Knowledge and public prosperity continued to advance together. Both attained their meridian in the age of Lorenzo the Magnificent. We cannot refrain from quoting the splendid passage, in which the Tuscan Thucydides describes the state of Italy at that period. "Ridotta tutta in somma pace e tranquillita, coltivata non meno ne' luoghi piu montuosi e piu sterili che nelle pianure e regioni piu fertili, ne sottoposta ad altro imperio che de' suoi medesimi, non solo era abbondantissima d' abitatori e di ricchezze; ma illustrata sommamente dalla magnificenza di molti principi, dallo splendore di molte nobilissime e bellissime citta, dalla sedia e maesta della religione, fioriva d' uomini prestantissimi nell' amministrazione delle cose pubbliche, e d'ingegni molto nobili in tutte le scienze, ed in qualunque arte preclara ed industriosa." When we peruse this just and splendid description, we can scarcely persuade ourselves that we are reading of times in which the annals of England and France present us only with a frightful spectacle of poverty, barbarity, and ignorance. From the oppressions of illiterate masters, and the sufferings of a degraded peasantry, it is delightful to turn to the opulent and enlightened States of Italy, to the vast and magnificent cities, the ports, the arsenals, the villas, the museums, the libraries, the marts filled with every article of comfort or luxury, the factories swarming with artisans, the Apennines covered with rich cultivation up to their very summits, the Po wafting the harvests of Lombardy to the granaries of Venice, and carrying back the silks of Bengal and the furs of Siberia to the palaces of Milan. With peculiar pleasure, every cultivated mind must repose on the fair, the happy, the glorious Florence, the halls which rang with the mirth of Pulci, the cell where twinkled the midnight lamp of Politian, the statues on which the young eye of Michael Angelo glared with the frenzy of a kindred inspiration, the gardens in which Lorenzo meditated some sparkling song for the May-day dance of the Etrurian virgins. Alas for the beautiful city! Alas for the wit and the learning, the genius and the love! "Le donne, e i cavalier, gli affanni, e gli agi, Che ne 'nvogliava amore e cortesia La dove i cuor son fatti si malvagi." A time was at hand, when all the seven vials of the Apocalypse were to be poured forth and shaken out over those pleasant countries, a time of slaughter, famine, beggary, infamy, slavery, despair. In the Italian States, as in many natural bodies, untimely decrepitude was the penalty of precocious maturity. Their early greatness, and their early decline, are principally to be attributed to the same cause, the preponderance which the towns acquired in the political system. In a community of hunters or of shepherds, every man easily and necessarily becomes a soldier. His ordinary avocations are perfectly compatible with all the duties of military service. However remote may be the expedition on which he is bound, he finds it easy to transport with him the stock from which he derives his subsistence. The whole people is an army; the whole year a march. Such was the state of society which facilitated the gigantic conquests of Attila and Tamerlane. But a people which subsists by the cultivation of the earth is in a very different situation. The husbandman is bound to the soil on which he labours. A long campaign would be ruinous to him. Still his pursuits are such as give to his frame both the active and the passive strength necessary to a soldier. Nor do they, at least in the infancy of agricultural science, demand his uninterrupted attention. At particular times of the year he is almost wholly unemployed, and can, without injury to himself, afford the time necessary for a short expedition. Thus the legions of Rome were supplied during its earlier wars. The season during which the fields did not require the presence of the cultivators sufficed for a short inroad and a battle. These operations, too frequently interrupted to produce decisive results, yet served to keep up among the people a degree of discipline and courage which rendered them, not only secure, but formidable. The archers and billmen of the middle ages, who, with provisions for forty days at their backs, left the fields for the camp, were troops of the same description. But when commerce and manufactures begin to flourish a great change takes place. The sedentary habits of the desk and the loom render the exertions and hardships of war insupportable. The business of traders and artisans requires their constant presence and attention. In such a community there is little superfluous time; but there is generally much superfluous money. Some members of the society are, therefore, hired to relieve the rest from a task inconsistent with their habits and engagements. The history of Greece is, in this, as in many other respects, the best commentary on the history of Italy. Five hundred years before the Christian era, the citizens of the republics round the Aegean Sea formed perhaps the finest militia that ever existed. As wealth and refinement advanced, the system underwent a gradual alteration. The Ionian States were the first in which commerce and the arts were cultivated, and the first in which the ancient discipline decayed. Within eighty years after the battle of Plataea, mercenary troops were everywhere plying for battles and sieges. In the time of Demosthenes, it was scarcely possible to persuade or compel the Athenians to enlist for foreign service. The laws of Lycurgus prohibited trade and manufactures. The Spartans, therefore, continued to form a national force long after their neighbours had begun to hire soldiers. But their military spirit declined with their singular institutions. In the second century before Christ, Greece contained only one nation of warriors, the savage highlanders of Aetolia, who were some generations behind their countrymen in civilisation and intelligence. All the causes which produced these effects among the Greeks acted still more strongly on the modern Italians. Instead of a power like Sparta, in its nature warlike, they had amongst them an ecclesiastical state, in its nature pacific. Where there are numerous slaves, every freeman is induced by the strongest motives to familiarise himself with the use of arms. The commonwealths of Italy did not, like those of Greece, swarm with thousands of these household enemies. Lastly, the mode in which military operations were conducted during the prosperous times of Italy was peculiarly unfavourable to the formation of an efficient militia. Men covered with iron from head to foot, armed with ponderous lances, and mounted on horses of the largest breed, were considered as composing the strength of an army. The infantry was regarded as comparatively worthless, and was neglected till it became really so. These tactics maintained their ground for centuries in most parts of Europe. That foot- soldiers could withstand the charge of heavy cavalry was thought utterly impossible, till, towards the close of the fifteenth century, the rude mountaineers of Switzerland dissolved the spell, and astounded the most experienced generals by receiving the dreaded shock on an impenetrable forest of pikes. The use of the Grecian spear, the Roman sword, or the modern bayonet, might be acquired with comparative ease. But nothing short of the daily exercise of years could train the man-at-arms to support his ponderous panoply, and manage his unwieldy weapon. Throughout Europe this most important branch of war became a separate profession. Beyond the Alps, indeed, though a profession, it was not generally a trade. It was the duty and the amusement of a large class of country gentlemen. It was the service by which they held their lands, and the diversion by which, in the absence of mental resources, they beguiled their leisure. But in the Northern States of Italy, as we have already remarked, the growing power of the cities, where it had not exterminated this order of men, had completely changed their habits. Here, therefore, the practice of employing mercenaries became universal, at a time when it was almost unknown in other countries. When war becomes the trade of a separate class, the least dangerous course left to a government is to force that class into a standing army. It is scarcely possible, that men can pass their lives in the service of one State, without feeling some interest in its greatness. Its victories are their victories. Its defeats are their defeats. The contract loses something of its mercantile character. The services of the soldier are considered as the effects of patriotic zeal, his pay as the tribute of national gratitude. To betray the power which employs him, to be even remiss in its service, are in his eyes the most atrocious and degrading of crimes. When the princes and commonwealths of Italy began to use hired troops, their wisest course would have been to form separate military establishments. Unhappily this was not done. The mercenary warriors of the Peninsula, instead of being attached to the service of different powers, were regarded as the common property of all. The connection between the State and its defenders was reduced to the most simple and naked traffic. The adventurer brought his horse, his weapons, his strength, and his experience, into the market. Whether the King of Naples or the Duke of Milan, the Pope or the Signory of Florence, struck the bargain, was to him a matter of perfect indifference. He was for the highest wages and the longest term. When the campaign for which he had contracted was finished, there was neither law nor punctilio to prevent him from instantly turning his arms against his late masters. The soldier was altogether disjoined from the citizen and from the subject. The natural consequences followed. Left to the conduct of men who neither loved those whom they defended, nor hated those whom they opposed, who were often bound by stronger ties to the army against which they fought than to the State which they served, who lost by the termination of the conflict, and gained by its prolongation, war completely changed its character. Every man came into the field of battle impressed with the knowledge that, in a few days, he might be taking the pay of the power against which he was then employed, and, fighting by the side of his enemies against his associates. The strongest interests and the strongest feelings concurred to mitigate the hostility of those who had lately been brethren in arms, and who might soon be brethren in arms once more. Their common profession was a bond of union not to be forgotten even when they were engaged in the service of contending parties. Hence it was that operations, languid and indecisive beyond any recorded in history, marches and counter-marches, pillaging expeditions and blockades, bloodless capitulations and equally bloodless combats, make up the military history of Italy during the course of nearly two centuries. Mighty armies fight from sunrise to sunset. A great victory is won. Thousands of prisoners are taken; and hardly a life is lost. A pitched battle seems to have been really less dangerous than an ordinary civil tumult. Courage was now no longer necessary even to the military character. Men grew old in camps, and acquired the highest renown by their warlike achievements, without being once required to face serious danger. The political consequences are too well known. The richest and most enlightened part of the world was left undefended to the assaults of every barbarous invader, to the brutality of Switzerland, the insolence of France, and the fierce rapacity of Arragon. The moral effects which followed from this state of things were still more remarkable. Among the rude nations which lay beyond the Alps, valour was absolutely indispensable. Without it none could be eminent; few could be secure. Cowardice was, therefore, naturally considered as the foulest reproach. Among the polished Italians, enriched by commerce, governed by law, and passionately attached to literature, everything was done by superiority and intelligence. Their very wars, more pacific than the peace of their neighbours, required rather civil than military qualifications. Hence, while courage was the point of honour in other countries, ingenuity became the point of honour in Italy. From these principles were deduced, by processes strictly analogous, two opposite systems of fashionable morality. Through the greater part of Europe, the vices which peculiarly belong to timid dispositions, and which are the natural defence Of weakness, fraud, and hypocrisy, have always been most disreputable. On the other hand, the excesses of haughty and daring spirits have been treated with indulgence, and even with respect. The Italians regarded with corresponding lenity those crimes which require self-command, address, quick observation, fertile invention, and profound knowledge of human nature. Such a prince as our Henry the Fifth would have been the idol of the North. The follies of his youth, the selfish ambition of his manhood, the Lollards roasted at slow fires the prisoners massacred on the field of battle, the expiring lease of priestcraft renewed for another century, the dreadful legacy of a causeless and hopeless war bequeathed to a people who had no interest in its event, everything is forgotten but the victory of Agincourt. Francis Sforza, on the other hand, was the model of Italian heroes. He made his employers and his rivals alike his tools. He first overpowered his open enemies by the help of faithless allies; he then armed himself against his allies with the spoils taken from his enemies. By his incomparable dexterity, he raised himself from the precarious and dependent situation of a military adventurer to the first throne of Italy. To such a man much was forgiven, hollow friendship, ungenerous enmity, violated faith. Such are the opposite errors which men commit, when their morality is not a science but a taste, when they abandon eternal principles for accidental associations. We have illustrated our meaning by an instance taken from history. We will select another from fiction. Othello murders his wife; he gives orders for the murder of his lieutenant; he ends by murdering himself. Yet he never loses the esteem and affection of Northern readers. His intrepid and ardent spirit redeems everything. The unsuspecting confidence with which he listens to his adviser, the agony with which he shrinks from the thought of shame, the tempest of passion with which he commits his crimes, and the haughty fearlessness with which he avows them, give an extraordinary interest to his character. Iago, on the contrary, is the object of universal loathing. Many are inclined to suspect that Shakspeare has been seduced into an exaggeration unusual with him, and has drawn a monster who has no archetype in human nature. Now we suspect that an Italian audience in the fifteenth century would have felt very differently. Othello would have inspired nothing but detestation and contempt. The folly with which he trusts the friendly professions of a man whose promotion he had obstructed, the credulity with which he takes unsupported assertions, and trivial circumstances, for unanswerable proofs, the violence with which he silences the exculpation till the exculpation can only aggravate his misery, would have excited the abhorrence and disgust of the spectators. The conduct of Iago they would assuredly have condemned; but they would have condemned it as we condemn that of his victim. Something of interest and respect would have mingled with their disapprobation. The readiness of the traitor's wit, the clearness of his judgment, the skill with which he penetrates the dispositions of others and conceals his own, would have ensured to him a certain portion of their esteem. So wide was the difference between the Italians and their neighbours. A similar difference existed between the Greeks of the second century before Christ, and their masters the Romans. The conquerors, brave and resolute, faithful to their engagements, and strongly influenced by religious feelings, were, at the same time, ignorant, arbitrary, and cruel. With the vanquished people were deposited all the art, the science, and the literature of the Western world. In poetry, in philosophy, in painting, in architecture, in sculpture, they had no rivals. Their manners were polished, their perceptions acute, their invention ready; they were tolerant, affable, humane; but of courage and sincerity they were almost utterly destitute. Every rude centurion consoled himself for his intellectual inferiority, by remarking that knowledge and taste seemed only to make men atheists, cowards, and slaves. The distinction long continued to be strongly marked, and furnished an admirable subject for the fierce sarcasms of Juvenal. The citizen of an Italian commonwealth was the Greek of the time of Juvenal and the Greek of the time of Pericles, joined in one. Like the former, he was timid and pliable, artful and mean. But, like the latter, he had a country. Its independence and prosperity were dear to him. If his character were degraded by some base crimes, it was, on the other hand, ennobled by public spirit and by an honourable ambition, A vice sanctioned by the general opinion is merely a vice. The evil terminates in itself. A vice condemned by the general opinion produces a pernicious effect on the whole character. The former is a local malady, the latter a constitutional taint. When the reputation of the offender is lost, he too often flings the remains of his virtue after it in despair. The Highland gentleman who, a century ago, lived by taking blackmail from his neighbours, committed the same crime for which Wild was accompanied to Tyburn by the huzzas of two hundred thousand people. But there can be no doubt that he was a much less depraved man than Wild. The deed for which Mrs.Brownrigg was hanged sinks into nothing, when compared with theconduct of the Roman who treated the public to a hundred pair of gladiators. Yet we should greatly wrong such a Roman if we supposed that his disposition was as cruel as that of Mrs. Brownrigg. In our own country, a woman forfeits her place in society by what, in a man, is too commonly considered as an honourable distinction, and, at worst, as a venial error. The consequence is notorious. The moral principle of a woman is frequently more impaired by a single lapse from virtue than that of a man by twenty years of intrigues. Classical antiquity would furnish us with instances stronger, if possible, than those to which we have referred. We must apply this principle to the case before us. Habits of dissimulation and falsehood, no doubt, mark a man of our age and country as utterly worthless and abandoned. But it by no means follows that a similar judgment would be just in the case of an Italian of the middle ages. On the contrary, we frequently find those faults which we are accustomed to consider as certain indications of a mind altogether depraved, in company with great and good qualities, with generosity, with benevolence, with disinterestedness. From such a state of society, Palamedes, in the admirable dialogue of Hume, might have drawn illustrations of his theory as striking as any of those with which Fourli furnished him. These are not, we well know, the lessons which historians are generally most careful to teach, or readers most willing to learn. But they are not therefore useless. How Philip disposed his troops at Chaeronea, where Hannibal crossed the Alps, whether Mary blew up Darnley, or Siquier shot Charles the Twelfth, and ten thousand other questions of the same description, are in themselves unimportant. The inquiry may amuse us, but the decision leaves us no wiser. He alone reads history aright who, observing how powerfully circumstances influence the feelings and opinions of men, how often vices pass into virtues and paradoxes into axioms, learns to distinguish what is accidental and transitory in human nature from what is essential and immutable. In this respect no history suggests more important reflections than that of the Tuscan and Lombard commonwealths. The character of the Italian statesman seems, at first sight, a collection of contradictions, a phantom as monstrous as the portress of hell in Milton, half divinity, half snake, majestic and beautiful above, grovelling and poisonous below, We see a man whose thoughts and words have no connection with each other, who never hesitates at an oath when he wishes to seduce, who never wants a pretext when he is inclined to betray. His cruelties spring, not from the heat of blood, or the insanity of uncontrolled power, but from deep and cool meditation. His passions, like well-trained troops, are impetuous by rule, and in their most headstrong fury never forget the discipline to which they have been accustomed. His whole soul is occupied with vast and complicated schemes of ambition: yet his aspect and language exhibit nothing but philosophical moderation. Hatred and revenge eat into his heart: yet every look is a cordial smile, every gesture a familiar caress. He never excites the suspicion of his adversaries by petty provocations. His purpose is disclosed only when it is accomplished. His face is unruffled, his speech is courteous, till vigilance is laid asleep, till a vital point is exposed, till a sure aim is taken; and then he strikes for the first and last time. Military courage, the boast of the sottish German, of the frivolous and prating Frenchman, of the romantic and arrogant Spaniard, he neither possesses nor values. He shuns danger, not because he is insensible to shame, but because, in the society in which he lives, timidity has ceased to be shameful. To do an injury openly is, in his estimation, as wicked as to do it secretly, and far less profitable. With him the most honourable means are those which are the surest, the speediest, and the darkest. He cannot comprehend how a man should scruple to deceive those whom he does not scruple to destroy. He would think it madness to declare open hostilities against rivals whom he might stab in a friendly embrace, or poison in a consecrated wafer. Yet this man, black with the vices which we consider as most loathsome, traitor, hypocrite, coward, assassin, was by no means destitute even of those virtues which we generally consider as indicating superior elevation of character. In civil courage, in perseverance, in presence of mind, those barbarous warriors, who were foremost in the battle or the breach, were far his inferiors. Even the dangers which he avoided with a caution almost pusillanimous never confused his perceptions, never paralysed his inventive faculties, never wrung out one secret from his smooth tongue, and his inscrutable brow. Though a dangerous enemy, and a still more dangerous accomplice, he could be a just and beneficent ruler. With so much unfairness in his policy, there was an extraordinary degree of fairness in his intellect. Indifferent to truth in the transactions of life, he was honestly devoted to truth in the researches of speculation. Wanton cruelty was not in his nature. On the contrary, where no political object was at stake, his disposition was soft and humane. The susceptibility of his nerves and the activity of his imagination inclined him, to sympathise with the feelings of others, and to delight in the charities and courtesies of social life. Perpetually descending to actions which might seem to mark a mind diseased through all its faculties, he had nevertheless an exquisite sensibility, both for the natural and the moral sublime, for every graceful and every lofty conception. Habits of petty intrigue and dissimulation might have rendered him incapable of great general views, but that the expanding effect of his philosophical studies counteracted the narrowing tendency. He had the keenest enjoyment of wit, eloquence, and poetry. The fine arts profited alike by the severity of his judgment, and by the liberality of his patronage. The portraits of some of the remarkable Italians of those times are perfectly in harmony with this description. Ample and majestic foreheads, brows strong and dark, but not frowning, eyes of which the calm full gaze, while it expresses nothing, seems to discern everything, cheeks pale with thought and sedentary habits, lips formed with feminine delicacy, but compressed with more than masculine decision, mark out men at once enterprising and timid, men equally skilled in detecting the purposes of others, and in concealing their own, men who must have been formidable enemies and unsafe allies, but men, at the same time, whose tempers were mild and equable, and who possessed an amplitude and subtlety of intellect which would have rendered them eminent either in active or in contemplative life, and fitted them either to govern or to instruct mankind. Every age and every nation has certain characteristic vices, which prevail almost universally, which scarcely any person scruples to avow, and which even rigid moralists but faintly censure. Succeeding generations change the fashion of their morals, with the fashion of their hats and their coaches; take some other kind of wickedness under their patronage, and wonder at the depravity of their ancestors. Nor is this all. Posterity, that high court of appeal which is never tired of eulogising its own justice and discernment, acts on such occasions like a Roman dictator after a general mutiny. Finding the delinquents too numerous to be all punished, it selects some of them at hazard, to bear the whole penalty of an offence in which they are not more deeply implicated than those who escape, Whether decimation be a convenient mode of military execution, we know not; but we solemnly protest against the introduction of such a principle into the philosophy of history. In the present instance, the lot has fallen on Machiavelli, a man whose public conduct was upright and honourable, whose views of morality, where they differed from those of the persons around him, seemed to have differed for the better, and whose only fault was, that, having adopted some of the maxims then generally received, he arranged them more luminously, and expressed them more forcibiy, than any other writer. Having now, we hope, in some degree cleared the personal character of Machiavelli, we come to the consideration of his works. As a poet he is not entitled to a high place; but his comedies deserve attention. The Mandragola, in particular, is superior to the best of Goldoni, and inferior only to the best of Moliere. It is the work of a man who, if he had devoted himself to the drama, would probably have attained the highest eminence, and produced a permanent and salutary effect on the national taste. This we infer, not so much from the degree, as from the kind of its excellence. There are compositions which indicate still greater talent, and which are perused with still greater delight, from which we should have drawn very different conclusions. Books quite worthless are quite harmless. The sure sign of the general decline of an art is the frequent occurrence, not of deformity, but of misplaced beauty. In general, Tragedy is corrupted by eloquence, and Comedy by wit. The real object of the drama is the exhibition of human character. This, we conceive, is no arbitrary canon, originating in local and temporary associations, like those canons which regulate the number of acts in a play, or of syllables in a line. To this fundamental law every other regulation is subordinate. The situations which most signally develop character form the best plot. The mother tongue of the passions is the best style. This principle rightly understood, does not debar the poet from any grace of composition. There is no style in which some man may not under some circumstances express himself. There is therefore no style which the drama rejects, none which it does not occasionally require. It is in the discernment of place, of time, and of person, that the inferior artists fail. The fantastic rhapsody of Mercutio, the elaborate declamation of Antony, are, where Shakspeare has placed them, natural and pleasing. But Dryden would have made Mercutio challenge Tybalt in hyperboles as fanciful as those in which he describes the chariot of Mab. Corneille would have represented Antony as scolding and coaxing Cleopatra with all the measured rhetoric of a funeral oration. No writers have injured the Comedy of England so deeply as Congreve and Sheridan. Both were men of splendid wit and polished taste. Unhappily, they made all their characters in their own likeness. Their works bear the same relation to the legitimate drama which a transparency bears to a painting. There are no delicate touches, no hues imperceptibly fading into each other: the whole is lighted up with an universal glare. Outlines and tints are forgotten in the common blaze which illuminates all. The flowers and fruits of the intellect abound; but it is the abundance of a jungle, not of a garden, unwholesome, bewildering, unprofitable from its very plenty rank from its very fragrance. Every fop, every boor, every valet, is a man of wit. The very butts and dupes, Tattle, Witwould, Puff, Acres, outshine the whole Hotel of Rambouillet. To prove the whole system of this school erroneous, it is only necessary to apply the test which dissolved the enchanted Florimel, to place the true by the false Thalia, to contrast the most celebrated characters which have been drawn by the writers of whom we speak with the Bastard in King John or the Nurse in Romeo and Juliet. It was not surely from want of wit that Shakspeare adopted so different a manner. Benedick and Beatrice throw Mirabel and Millamant into the shade. All the good sayings of the facetious houses of Absolute and Surface might have been clipped from the single character of Falstaff, without being missed. It would have been easy for that fertile mind to have given Bardolph and Shallow as much wit as Prince Hal, and to have made Dogberry and Verges retort on each other in sparkling epigrams. But he knew that such indiscriminate prodigality was, to use his own admirable language, "from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was, and is, to hold, as it were, the mirror up to Nature." This digression will enable our readers to understand what we mean when we say that in the Mandragola, Machiavelli has proved that he completely understood the nature of the dramatic art, and possessed talents which would have enabled him to excel in it. By the correct and vigorous delineation of human nature, it produces interest without a pleasing or skilful plot, and laughter without the least ambition of wit. The lover, not a very delicate or generous lover, and his adviser the parasite, are drawn with spirit. The hypocritical confessor is an admirable portrait. He is, if we mistake not, the original of Father Dominic, the best comic character of Dryden. But old Nicias is the glory of the piece. We cannot call to mind anything that resembles him. The follies which Moliere ridicules are those of affection, not those of fatuity. Coxcombs and pedants, not absolute simpletons, are his game. Shakspeare has indeed a vast assortment of fools; but the precise species of which we speak is not, if we remember right, to be found there. Shallow is a fool. But his animal spirits supply, to a certain degree, the place of cleverness. His talk is to that of Sir John what soda water is to champagne. It has the effervescence though not the body or the flavour. Slender and Sir Andrew Aguecheek are fools, troubled with an uneasy consciousness of their folly, which in the latter produces meekness and docility, and in the former, awkwardness, obstinacy, and confusion. Cloten is an arrogant fool, Osric a foppish fool, Ajax a savage fool; but Nicias is, as Thersites says of Patroclus, a fool positive. His mind is occupied by no strong feeling; it takes every character, and retains none; its aspect is diversified, not by passions, but by faint and transitory semblances of passion, a mock joy, a mock fear, a mock love, a mock pride, which chase each other like shadows over its surface, and vanish as soon as they appear. He is just idiot enough to be an object, not of pity or horror, but of ridicule. He bears some resemblance to poor Calandrino, whose mishaps, as recounted by Boccaccio, have made all Europe merry for more than four centuries. He perhaps resembles still more closely Simon da Villa, to whom Bruno and Buffalmacco promised the love of the Countess Civillari. Nicias is, like Simon, of a learned profession; and the dignity with which he wears the doctoral fur, renders his absurdities infinitely more grotesque. The old Tuscan is the very language for such a being. Its peculiar simplicity gives even to the most forcible reasoning and the most brilliant wit an infantine air, generally delightful, but to a foreign reader sometimes a little ludicrous. Heroes and statesmen seem to lisp when they use it. It becomes Nicias incomparably, and renders all his silliness infinitely more silly. We may add, that the verses with which the Mandragola is interspersed, appear to us to be the most spirited and correct of all that Machiavelli has written in metre. He seems to have entertained the same opinion; for he has introduced some of them in other places. The contemporaries of the author were not blind to the merits of this striking piece. It was acted at Florence with the greatest success. Leo the Tenth was among its admirers, and by his order it was represented at Rome. [Nothing can be more evident than that Paulus Jovius designates the Mandragola under the name of the Nicias. We should not have noticed what is so perfectly obvious. were it not that this natural and palpable misnomer has led the sagacious and industrious Bayle into a gross error.] The Clizia is an imitation of the Casina of Plautus, which is itself an imitation of the lost kleroumenoi of Diphilus. Plautus was, unquestionably, one of the best Latin writers; but the Casina is by no means one of his best plays; nor is it one which offers great facilities to an imitator. The story is as alien from modern habits of life, as the manner in which it is developed from the modern fashion of composition. The lover remains in the country and the heroine in her chamber during the whole action, leaving their fate to be decided by a foolish father, a cunning mother, and two knavish servants. Machiavelli has executed his task with judgment and taste. He has accommodated the plot to a different state of society, and has very dexterously connected it with the history of his own times. The relation of the trick put on the doting old lover is exquisitely humorous. It is far superior to the corresponding passage in the Latin comedy, and scarcely yields to the account which Falstaff gives of his ducking. Two other comedies without titles, the one in prose, the other in verse, appear among the works of Machiavelli. The former is very short, lively enough, but of no great value. The latter we can scarcely believe to be genuine. Neither its merits nor its defects remind us of the reputed author. It was first printed in 1796, from a manuscript discovered in the celebrated library of the Strozzi. Its genuineness, if we have been rightly informed, is established solely by the comparison of hands. Our suspicions are strengthened by the circumstance, that the same manuscript contained a description of the plague of 1527, which has also, in consequence, been added to the works of Machiavelli. Of this last composition the strongest external evidence would scarcely induce us to believe him guilty. Nothing was ever written more detestable in matter and manner. The narrations, the reflections, the jokes, the lamentations, are all the very worst of their respective kinds, at once trite and affected, threadbare tinsel from the Rag Fairs and Monmouth Streets of literature. A foolish schoolboy might write such a piece, and, after he had written it, think it much finer than the incomparable introduction of the Decameron. But that a shrewd statesman, whose earliest works are characterised by manliness of thought and language, should, at near sixty years of age, descend to such puerility, is utterly inconceivable. The little novel of Belphegor is pleasantly conceived and pleasantly told. But the extravagance of the satire in some measure injures its effect. Machiavelli was unhappily married; and his wish to avenge his own cause and that of his brethren in misfortune, carried him beyond even the licence of fiction. Jonson seems to have combined some hints taken from this tale, with others from Boccaccio, in the plot of The Devil is an Ass, a play which, though not the most highly finished of his compositions, is perhaps that which exhibits the strongest proofs of genius. The Political Correspondence of Machiavelli, first published in 1767, is unquestionably genuine, and highly valuable. The unhappy circumstances in which his country was placed during the greater part of his public life gave extraordinary encouragement to diplomatic talents. From the moment that Charles the Eighth descended from the Alps, the whole character of Italian politics was changed. The governments of the Peninsula ceased to form an independent system. Drawn from their old orbit by the attraction of the larger bodies which now approached them, they became mere satellites of France and Spain. All their disputes, internal and external, were decided by foreign influence. The contests of opposite factions were carried on, not as formerly in the senate- house or in the marketplace, but in the antechambers of Louis and Ferdinand. Under these circumstances, the prosperity of the Italian States depended far more on the ability of their foreign agents, than on the conduct of those who were intrusted with the domestic administration. The ambassador had to discharge functions far more delicate than transmitting orders of knighthood, introducing tourists, or presenting his brethren with the homage of his high consideration. He was an advocate to whose management the dearest interests of his clients were intrusted, a spy clothed with an inviolable character. Instead of consulting, by a reserved manner and ambiguous style, the dignity of those whom he represented, he was to plunge into all the intrigues of the Court at which he resided, to discover and flatter every weakness of the prince, and of the favourite who governed the prince, and of the lacquey who governed the favourite. He was to compliment the mistress and bribe the confessor, to panegyrise or supplicate, to laugh or weep, to accommodate himself to every caprice, to lull every suspicion, to treasure every hint, to be everything, to observe everything, to endure everything. High as the art of political intrigue had been carried in Italy, these were times which required it all. On these arduous errands Machiavelli was frequently employed. He was sent to treat with the King of the Romans and with the Duke of Valentinois. He was twice ambassador of the Court of Rome, and thrice at that of France. In these missions, and in several others of inferior importance, he acquitted himself with great dexterity. His despatches form one of the most amusing and instructive collections extant. The narratives are clear and agreeably written; the remarks on men and things clever and judicious. The conversations are reported in a spirited and characteristic manner. We find ourselves introduced into the presence of the men who, during twenty eventful years, swayed the destinies of Europe. Their wit and their folly, their fretfulness and their merriment, are exposed to us. We are admitted to overhear their chat, and to watch their familiar gestures. It is interesting and curious to recognise, in circumstances which elude the notice of historians, the feeble violence and shallow cunning of Louis the Twelfth; the bustling insignificance of Maximilian, cursed with an impotent pruriency for renown, rash yet timid, obstinate yet fickle, always in a hurry, yet always too late; the fierce and haughty energy which gave dignity to the eccentricities of Julius; the soft and graceful manners which masked the insatiable ambition and the implacable hatred of Caesar Borgia. We have mentioned Caesar Borgia. It is impossible not to pause for a moment on the name of a man in whom the political morality of Italy was so strongly personified, partially blended with the sterner lineaments of the Spanish character. On two important occasions Machiavelli was admitted to his society; once, at the moment when Caesar's splendid villainy achieved its most signal triumph, when he caught in one snare and crushed at one blow all his most formidable rivals; and again when, exhausted by disease and overwhelmed by misfortunes, which no human prudence could have averted, he was the prisoner of the deadliest enemy of his house. These interviews between the greatest speculative and the greatest practical statesman of the age are fully described in the Correspondence, and form perhaps the most interesting part of it. From some passages in The Prince, and perhaps also from some indistinct traditions, several writers have supposed a connection between those remarkable men much closer than ever existed. The Envoy has even been accused of prompting the crimes of the artful and merciless tyrant. But from the official documents it is clear that their intercourse, though ostensibly amicable, was in reality hostile. It cannot be doubted, however, that the imagination of Machiavelli was strongly impressed, and his speculations on government coloured, by the observations which he made on the singular character and equally singular fortunes of a man who under such disadvantages had achieved such exploits; who, when sensuality, varied through innumerable forms, could no longer stimulate his sated mind, found a more powerful and durable excitement in the intense thirst of empire and revenge; who emerged from the sloth and luxury of the Roman purple the first prince and general of the age; who, trained in an unwarlike profession, formed a gallant army out of the dregs of an unwarlike people; who, after acquiring sovereignty by destroying his enemies, acquired popularity by destroying his tools; who had begun to employ for the most salutary ends the power which he had attained by the most atrocious means; who tolerated within the sphere of his iron despotism no plunderer or oppressor but himself; and who fell at last amidst the mingled curses and regrets of a people of whom his genius had been the wonder, and might have been the salvation. Some of those crimes of Borgia which to us appear the most odious would not, from causes which we have already considered, have struck an Italian of the fifteenth century with equal horror. Patriotic feeling also might induce Machiavelli to look with some indulgence and regret on the memory of the only leader who could have defended the independence of Italy against the confederate spoilers of Cambray. On this subject Machiavelli felt most strongly. Indeed the expulsion of the foreign tyrants, and the restoration of that golden age which had preceded the irruption of Charles the Eighth, were projects which, at that time, fascinated all the master-spirits of Italy. The magnificent vision delighted the great but ill-regulated mind of Julius. It divided with manuscripts and sauces, painters, and falcons, the attention of the frivolous Leo. It prompted the generous treason of Morone. It imparted a transient energy to the feeble mind and body of the last Sforza. It excited for one moment an honest ambition in the false heart of Pescara. Ferocity and insolence were not among the vices of the national character. To the discriminating cruelties of politicians, committed for great ends on select victims, the moral code of the Italians was too indulgent. But though they might have recourse to barbarity as an expedient, they did not require it as a stimulant. They turned with loathing from the atrocity of the strangers who seemed to love blood for its own sake, who, not content with subjugating, were impatient to destroy, who found a fiendish pleasure in razing magnificent cities, cutting the throats of enemies who cried for quarter, or suffocating an unarmed population by thousands in the caverns to which it had fled for safety. Such were the cruelties which daily excited the terror and disgust of a people among whom, till lately, the worst that a soldier had to fear in a pitched battle was the loss of his horse and the expense of his ransom. The swinish intemperance of Switzerland, the wolfish avarice of Spain, the gross licentiousness of the French, indulged in violation of hospitality, of decency, of love itself, the wanton inhumanity which was common to all the invaders, had made them objects of deadly hatred to the inhabitants of the Peninsula. The wealth which had been accumulated during centuries of prosperity and repose was rapidly melting away. The intellectual superiority of the oppressed people only rendered them more keenly sensible of their political degradation. Literature and taste, indeed, still disguised with a flush of hectic loveliness and brilliancy the ravages of an incurable decay. The iron had not yet entered into the soul. The time was not yet come when eloquence was to be gagged, and reason to be hoodwinked, when the harp of the poet was to be hung on the willows of Arno, and the right hand of the painter to forget its cunning. Yet a discerning eye might even then have seen that genius and learning would not long survive the state of things from which they had sprung, and that the great men whose talents gave lustre to that melancholy period had been formed under the influence of happier days, and would leave no successors behind them. The times which shine with the greatest splendour in literary history are not always those to which the human mind is most indebted. Of this we may be convinced, by comparing the generation which follows them with that which had preceded them. The first fruits which are reaped under a bad system often spring from seed sown under a good one. Thus it was, in some measure, with the Augustan age. Thus it was with the age of Raphael and Ariosto, of Aldus and Vida. Machiavelli deeply regretted the misfortunes of his country, and clearly discerned the cause and the remedy. It was the military system of the Italian people which had extinguished their value and discipline, and left their wealth an easy prey to every foreign plunderer. The Secretary projected a scheme alike honourable to his heart and to his intellect, for abolishing the use of mercenary troops, and for organising a national militia. The exertions which he made to effect this great object ought alone to rescue his name from obloquy. Though his situation and his habits were pacific, he studied with intense assiduity the theory of war. He made himself master of all its details. The Florentine Government entered into his views. A council of war was appointed. Levies were decreed. The indefatigable minister flew from place to place in order to superintend the execution of his design. The times were, in some respects, favourable to the experiment. The system of military tactics had undergone a great revolution. The cavalry was no longer considered as forming the strength of an army. The hours which a citizen could spare from his ordinary employments, though by no means sufficient to familiarise him with the exercise of a man-at-arms, might render him an useful foot-soldier. The dread of a foreign yoke, of plunder, massacre, and conflagration, might have conquered that repugnance to military pursuits which both the industry and the idleness of great towns commonly generate. For a time the scheme promised well. The new troops acquitted themselves respectably in the field. Machiavelli looked with parental rapture on the success of his plan, and began to hope that the arms of Italy might once more be formidable to the barbarians of the Tagus and the Rhine. But the tide of misfortune came on before the barriers which should have withstood it were prepared. For a time, indeed, Florence might be considered as peculiarly fortunate. Famine and sword and pestilence had devastated the fertile plains and stately cities of the Po. All the curses denounced of old against Tyre seemed to have fallen on Venice. Her merchants already stood afar off, lamenting for their great city. The time seemed near when the sea-weed should overgrow her silent Rialto, and the fisherman wash his nets in her deserted arsenal. Naples had been four times conquered and reconquered by tyrants equally indifferent to its welfare and equally greedy for its spoils. Florence, as yet, had only to endure degradation and extortion, to submit to the mandates of foreign powers, to buy over and over again, at an enormous price, what was already justly her own, to return thanks for being wronged, and to ask pardon for being in the right. She was at length deprived of the blessings even of this infamous and servile repose. Her military and political institutions were swept away together. The Medici returned, in the train of foreign invaders, from their long exile. The policy of Machiavelli was abandoned; and his public services were requited with poverty, imprisonment, and torture. The fallen statesman still clung to his project with unabated ardour. With the view of vindicating it from some popular objections and of refuting some prevailing errors on the subject of military science, he wrote his seven books on The Art of War. This excellent work is in the form of a dialogue. The opinions of the writer are put into the mouth of Fabrizio Colonna, a powerful nobleman of the Ecclesiastical State, and an officer of distinguished merit in the service of the King of Spain. Colonna visits Florence on his way from Lombardy to his own domains. He is invited to meet some friends at the house of Cosimo Rucellai, an amiable and accomplished young man, whose early death Machiavelli feelingly deplores. After partaking of an elegant entertainment, they retire from the heat into the most shady recesses of the garden. Fabrizio is struck by the sight of some uncommon plants. Cosimo says that, though rare, in modern days, they are frequently mentioned by the classical authors, and that his grandfather, like many other Italians, amused himself with practising the ancient methods of gardening. Fabrizio expresses his regret that those who, in later times, affected the manners of the old Romans should select for imitation the most trifling pursuits. This leads to a conversation on the decline of military discipline and on the best means of restoring it. The institution of the Florentine militia is ably defended; and several improvements are suggested in the details. The Swiss and the Spaniards were, at that time, regarded as the best soldiers in Europe. The Swiss battalion consisted of pikemen, and bore a close resemblance to the Greek phalanx. The Spaniards, like the soldiers of Rome, were armed with the sword and the shield. The victories of Flamininus and Aemilius over the Macedonian kings seem to prove the superiority of the weapons used by the legions. The same experiment had been recently tried with the same result at the battle of Ravenna, one of those tremendous days into which human folly and wickedness compress the whole devastation of a famine or a plague. In that memorable conflict, the infantry of Arragon, the old companions of Gonsalvo, deserted by all their allies, hewed a passage through the thickest of the imperial pikes, and effected an unbroken retreat, in the face of the gendarmerie of De Foix, and the renowned artillery of Este. Fabrizio, or rather Machiavelli, proposes to combine the two systems, to arm the foremost lines with the pike for the purpose of repulsing cavalry, and those in the rear with the sword, as being a weapon better adapted for every other purpose. Throughout the work, the author expresses the highest admiration of the military science of the ancient Romans, and the greatest contempt for the maxims which had been in vogue amongst the Italian commanders of the preceding generation. He prefers infantry to cavalry, and fortified camps to fortified towns. He is inclined to substitute rapid movements and decisive engagements for the languid and dilatory operations of his countrymen. He attaches very little importance to the invention of gunpowder. Indeed he seems to think that it ought scarcely to produce any change in the mode of arming or of disposing troops. The general testimony of historians, it must be allowed, seems to prove that the ill-constructed and ill-served artillery of those times, though useful in a siege, was of little value on the field of battle. Of the tactics of Machiavelli we will not venture to give an opinion: but we are certain that his book is most able and interesting. As a commentary on the history of his times, it is invaluable. The ingenuity, the grace, and the perspicuity of the style, and the eloquence and animation of particular passages, must give pleasure even to readers who take no interest in the subject. The Prince and the Discourses on Livy were written after the fall of the Republican Government. The former was dedicated to the young Lorenzo di Medici. This circumstance seems to have disgusted the contemporaries of the writer far more than the doctrines which have rendered the name of the work odious in later times. It was considered as an indication of political apostasy. The fact however seems to have been that Machiavelli, despairing of the liberty of Florence, was inclined to support any government which might preserve her independence. The interval which separated a democracy and a despotism, Soderini and Lorenzo, seemed to vanish when compared with the difference between the former and the present state of Italy, between the security, the opulence, and the repose which she had enjoyed under her native rulers, and the misery in which she had been plunged since the fatal year in which the first foreign tyrant had descended from the Alps. The noble and pathetic exhortation with which The Prince concludes shows how strongly the writer felt upon this subject. The Prince traces the progress of an ambitious man, the Discourses the progress of an ambitious people. The same principles on which, in the former work, the elevation of an individual is explained, are applied in the latter, to the longer duration and more complex interest of a society. To a modern statesman the form of the Discourses may appear to be puerile. In truth Livy is not an historian on whom implicit reliance can be placed, even in cases where he must have possessed considerable means of information. And the first Decade, to which Machiavelli has confined himself, is scarcely entitled to more credit than our Chronicle of British Kings who reigned before the Roman invasion. But the commentator is indebted to Livy for little more than a few texts which he might as easily have extracted from the Vulgate or the Decameron. The whole train of thought is original. On the peculiar immorality which has rendered The Prince unpopular, and which is almost equally discernible in the Discourses, we have already given our opinion at length. We have attempted to show that it belonged rather to the age than to the man, that it was a partial taint, and by no means implied general depravity. We cannot, however, deny that it is a great blemish, and that it considerably diminishes the pleasure which, in other respects, those works must afford to every intelligent mind. It is, indeed, impossible to conceive a more healthful and vigorous constitution of the understanding than that which these works indicate. The qualities of the active and the contemplative statesman appear to have been blended in the mind of the writer into a rare and exquisite harmony. His skill in the details of business had not been acquired at the expense of his general powers. It had not rendered his mind less comprehensive; but it had served to correct his speculations and to impart to them that vivid and practical character which so widely distinguishes them from the vague theories of most political philosophers. Every man who has seen the world knows that nothing is so useless as a general maxim. If it be very moral and very true, it may serve for a copy to a charity-boy. If, like those of Rochefoucault, it be sparkling and whimsical, it may make an excellent motto for an essay. But few indeed of the many wise apophthegms which have been uttered, from the time of the Seven Sages of Greece to that of Poor Richard, have prevented a single foolish action. We give the highest and the most peculiar praise to the precepts of Machiavelli when we say that they may frequently be of real use in regulating conduct, not so much because they are more just or more profound than those which might be culled from other authors, as because they can be more readily applied to the problems of real life. There are errors in these works. But they are errors which a writer, situated like Machiavelli, could scarcely avoid. They arise, for the most part, from a single defect which appears to us to pervade his whole system. In his political scheme, the means had been more deeply considered than the ends. The great principle, that societies and laws exist only for the purpose of increasing the sum of private happiness, is not recognised with sufficient clearness. The good of the body, distinct from the good of the members, and sometimes hardly compatible with the good of the members, seems to be the object which he proposes to himself. Of all political fallacies, this has perhaps had the widest and the most mischievous operation. The state of society in the little commonwealths of Greece, the close connection and mutual dependence of the citizens, and the severity of the laws of war, tended to encourage an opinion which, under such circumstances, could hardly be called erroneous. The interests of every individual were inseparably bound up with those of the State. An invasion destroyed his corn-fields and vineyards, drove him from his home, and compelled him to encounter all the hardships of a military life. A treaty of peace restored him to security and comfort. A victory doubled the number of his slaves. A defeat perhaps made him a slave himself. When Pericles, in the Peloponnesian war, told the Athenians, that, if their country triumphed, their private losses would speedily be repaired, but, that, if their arms failed of success, every individual amongst them would probably be ruined, he spoke no more than the truth, He spoke to men whom the tribute of vanquished cities supplied with food and clothing, with the luxury of the bath and the amusements of the theatre, on whom the greatness of their Country conferred rank, and before whom the members of less prosperous communities trembled; to men who, in case of a change in the public fortunes, would, at least, be deprived of every comfort and every distinction which they enjoyed. To be butchered on the smoking ruins of their city, to be dragged in chains to a slave- market. to see one child torn from them to dig in the quarries of Sicily, and another to guard the harams of Persepolis, these were the frequent and probable consequences of national calamities. Hence, among the Greeks, patriotism became a governing principle, or rather an ungovernable passion. Their legislators and their philosophers took it for granted that, in providing for the strength and greatness of the state, they sufficiently provided for the happiness of the people. The writers of the Roman empire lived under despots, into whose dominion a hundred nations were melted down, and whose gardens would have covered the little commonwealths of Phlius and Plataea. Yet they continued to employ the same language, and to cant about the duty of sacrificing everything to a country to which they owed nothing. Causes similar to those which had influenced the disposition of the Greeks operated powerfully on the less vigorous and daring character of the Italians. The Italians, like the Greeks, were members of small communities. Every man was deeply interested in the welfare of the society to which he belonged, a partaker in its wealth and its poverty, in its glory and its shame. In the age of Machiavelli this was peculiarly the case. Public events had produced an immense sum of misery to private citizens. The Northern invaders had brought want to their boards, infamy to their beds, fire to their roofs, and the knife to their throats. It was natural that a man who lived in times like these should overrate the importance of those measures by which a nation is rendered formidable to its neighbours, and undervalue those which make it prosperous within itself. Nothing is more remarkable in the political treatises of Machiavelli than the fairness of mind which they indicate. It appears where the author is in the wrong, almost as strongly as where he is in the right. He never advances a false opinion because it is new or splendid, because he can clothe it in a happy phrase, or defend it by an ingenious sophism. His errors are at once explained by a reference to the circumstances in which he was placed. They evidently were not sought out; they lay in his way, and could scarcely be avoided. Such mistakes must necessarily be committed by early speculators in every science. In this respect it is amusing to compare The Prince and the Discourses with the Spirit of Laws. Montesquieu enjoys, perhaps, a wider celebrity than any political writer of modern Europe. Something he doubtless owes to his merit, but much more to his fortune. He had the good luck of a Valentine. He caught the eye of the French nation, at the moment when it was waking from the long sleep of political and religious bigotry; and, in consequence, he became a favourite. The English, at that time, considered a Frenchman who talked about constitutional checks and fundamental laws as a prodigy not less astonishing than the learned pig or the musical infant. Specious but shallow, studious of effect, indifferent to truth, eager to build a system, but careless of collecting those materials out of which alone a sound and durable system can be built, the lively President constructed theories as rapidly and as slightly as card-houses, no sooner projected than completed, no sooner completed than blown away, no sooner blown away than forgotten. Machiavelli errs only because his experience, acquired in a very peculiar state of society, could not always enable him to calculate the effect of institutions differing from those of which he had observed the operation. Montesquieu errs, because he has a fine thing to say, and is resolved to say it. If the phaenomena which lie before him will not suit his purpose, all history must be ransacked. If nothing established by authentic testimony can be racked or chipped to suit his Procrustean hypothesis, he puts up with some monstrous fable about Siam, or Bantam, or Japan, told by writers compared with whom Lucian and Gulliver were veracious, liars by a double right, as travellers and as Jesuits. Propriety of thought, and propriety of diction, are commonly found together. Obscurity and affectation are the two greatest faults of style. Obscurity of expression generally springs from confusion of ideas; and the same wish to dazzle at any cost which produces affectation in the manner of a writer, is likely to produce sophistry in his reasonings. The judicious and candid mind of Machiavelli shows itself in his luminous, manly, and polished language. The style of Montesquieu, on the other hand, indicates in every page a lively and ingenious, but an unsound mind. Every trick of expression, from the mysterious conciseness of an oracle to the flippancy of a Parisian coxcomb, is employed to disguise the fallacy of some positions, and the triteness of others. Absurdities are brightened into epigrams; truisms are darkened into enigmas. It is with difficulty that the strongest eye can sustain the glare with which some parts are illuminated, or penetrate the shade in which others are concealed. The political works of Machiavelli derive a peculiar interest from the mournful earnestness which he manifests whenever he touches on topics connected with the calamities of his native land. It is difficult to conceive any situation more painful than that of a great man, condemned to watch the lingering agony of an exhausted country, to tend it during the alternate fits of stupefaction and raving which precede its dissolution, and to see the symptoms of vitality disappear one by one, till nothing is left but coldness, darkness, and corruption. To this joyless and thankless duty was Machiavelli called. In the energetic language of the prophet, he was "mad for the sight of his eye which he saw," disunion in the council, effeminacy in the camp, liberty extinguished, commerce decaying, national honour sullied, an enlightened and flourishing people given over to the ferocity of ignorant savages. Though his opinions had no escaped the contagion of that political immorality which was common among his countrymen, his natural disposition seem to have been rather stern and impetuous than pliant and artful When the misery and degradation of Florence and the foul outrage which he had himself sustained recur to his mind, the smooth craft of his profession and his nation is exchanged for the honest bitterness of scorn and anger. He speaks like one sick of the calamitous times and abject people among whom his lot is cast. He pines for the strength and glory of ancient Rome, for the fasces of Brutus, and the sword of Scipio, the gravity of the curule chair, and the bloody pomp of the triumphal sacrifice. He seems to be transported back to the days when eight hundred thousand Italian warriors sprung to arms at the rumour of a Gallic invasion. He breathes all the spirit of those intrepid and haughty senators who forgot the dearest ties of nature in the claims of public duty, who looked with disdain on the elephants and on the gold of Pyrrhus, and listened with unaltered composure to the tremendous tidings of Cannae. Like an ancient temple deformed by the barbarous architecture of a later age, his character acquires an interest from the very circumstances which debase it. The original proportions are rendered more striking by the contrast which they present to the mean and incongruous additions. The influence of the sentiments which we have described was not apparent in his writings alone. His enthusiasm, barred from the career which it would have selected for itself, seems to have found a vent in desperate levity. He enjoyed a vindictive pleasure in outraging the opinions of a society which he despised. He became careless of the decencies which were expected from a man so highly distinguished in the literary and political world. The sarcastic bitterness of his conversation disgusted those who were more inclined to accuse his licentiousness than their own degeneracy, and who were unable to conceive the strength of those emotions which are concealed by the jests of the wretched, and by the follies of the wise. The historical works of Machiavelli still remain to be considered. The Life of Castruccio Castracani will occupy us for a very short time, and would scarcely have demanded our notice, had it not attracted a much greater share of public attention than it deserves. Few books, indeed, could be more interesting than a careful and judicious account, from such a pen, of the illustrious Prince of Lucca, the most eminent of those Italian chiefs who, like Pisistratus and Gelon, acquired a power felt rather than seen, and resting, not on law or on prescription, but on the public favour and on their great personal qualities. Such a work would exhibit to us the real nature of that species of sovereignty, so singular and so often misunderstood, which the Greeks denominated tyranny, and which, modified in some degree by the feudal system, reappeared in the commonwealths of Lombardy and Tuscany. But this little composition of Machiavelli is in no sense a history. It has no pretensions to fidelity. It is a trifle, and not a very successful trifle. It is scarcely more authentic than the novel of Belphegor, and is very much duller. The last great work of this illustrious man was the history of his native city. It was written by command of the Pope, who, as chief of the house of Medici, was at that time sovereign of Florence. The characters of Cosmo, of Piero, and of Lorenzo, are, however, treated with a freedom and impartiality equally honourable to the writer and to the patron. The miseries and humiliations of dependence, the bread which is more bitter than every other food, the stairs which are more painful than every other ascent, had not broken the spirit of Machiavelli. The most corrupting post in a corrupting profession had not depraved the generous heart of Clement. The History does not appear to be the fruit of much industry or research. It is unquestionably inaccurate. But it is elegant, lively, and picturesque, beyond any other in the Italian language. The reader, we believe, carries away from it a more vivid and a more faithful impression of the national character and manners than from more correct accounts. The truth is, that the book belongs rather to ancient than to modern literature. It is in the style, not of Davila and Clarendon, but of Herodotus and Tacitus. The classical histories may almost be called romances founded in fact. The relation is, no doubt, in all its principal points, strictly true. But the numerous little incidents which heighten the interest, the words, the gestures, the looks, are evidently furnished by the imagination of the author. The fashion of later times is different. A more exact narrative is given by the writer. It may be doubted whether more exact notions are conveyed to the reader. The best portraits are perhaps those in which there is a slight mixture of caricature, and we are not certain that the best histories are not those in which a little of the exaggeration of fictitious narrative is judiciously employed. Something is lost in accuracy; but much is gained in effect. The fainter lines are neglected but the great characteristic features are imprinted on the mind for ever. The History terminates with the death of Lorenzo de' Medici. Machiavelli had, it seems, intended to continue his narrative to a later period. But his death prevented the execution of his design; and the melancholy task of recording the desolation and shame of Italy devolved on Guicciardini. Machiavelli lived long enough to see the commencement of the last struggle for Florentine liberty. Soon after his death monarchy was finally established, not such a monarchy as that of which Cosmo had laid the foundations deep in the institution and feelings of his countryman, and which Lorenzo had embellished with the trophies of every science and every art; but a loathsome tyranny, proud and mean, cruel and feeble, bigoted and lascivious. The character of Machiavelli was hateful to the new masters of Italy; and those parts of his theory which were in strict accordance with their own daily practice afforded a pretext for blackening his memory. His works were misrepresented by the learned, misconstrued by the ignorant, censured by the Church, abused with all the rancour of simulated virtue by the tools of a base government, and the priests of a baser superstition. The name of the man whose genius had illuminated all the dark places of policy, and to whose patriotic wisdom an oppressed people had owed their last chance of emancipation and revenge, passed into a proverb of infamy. For more than two hundred years his bones lay undistinguished. At length, an English nobleman paid the as honours to the greatest statesman of Florence. In the church of Santa Croce a monument was erected to his memory, which is contemplated with reverence by all who can distinguish the virtues of a great mind through the corruptions of a degenerate age, and which will be approached with still deeper homage when the object to which his public life was devoted shall be attained, when the foreign yoke shall be broken, when a second Procida shall avenge the wrongs of Naples, when a happier Rienzi shall restore the good estate of Rome, when the streets of Florence and Bologna shall again resound with their ancient war-cry, Popolo; popolo; muoiano i tiranni! VON RANKE (October 1840) The Ecclesiastical and political History of the Popes of Rome, during the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries. By LEOPOLD RANKE, Professor in the University of Berlin: Translated from the German, by SARAH AUSTIN. 3 vols. 8vo. London: 1840. It is hardly necessary for us to say that this is an excellent book excellently translated. The original work of Professor Ranke is known and esteemed wherever German literature is studied, and has been found interesting even in a most inaccurate and dishonest French version. It is, indeed, the work of a mind fitted both for minute researches and for large speculations. It is written also in an admirable spirit, equally remote from levity and bigotry, serious and earnest, yet tolerant and impartial. It is, therefore, with the greatest pleasure that we now see this book take its place among the English classics. Of the translation we need only say that it is such as might be expected from the skill, the taste, and the scrupulous integrity of the accomplished lady who, as an interpreter between the mind of Germany and the mind of Britain, has already deserved so well of both countries. The subject of this book has always appeared to us singularly interesting. How it was that Protestantism did so much, yet did no more, how it was that the Church of Rome, having lost a large part of Europe, not only ceased to lose, but actually regained nearly half of what she had lost, is certainly a most curious and important question; and on this question Professor Ranke has thrown far more light than any other person who has written on it. There is not, and there never was on this earth, a work of human policy so well deserving of examination as the Roman Catholic Church. The history of that Church joins together the two great ages of human civilisation. No other institution is left standing which carries the mind back to the times when the smoke of sacrifice rose from the Pantheon, and when camelopards and tigers bounded in the Flavian amphitheatre. The proudest royal houses are but of yesterday, when compared with the line of the Supreme Pontiffs. That line we trace back in an unbroken series, from the Pope who crowned Napoleon in the nineteenth century to the Pope who crowned Pepin in the eighth; and far beyond the time of Pepin the august dynasty extends, till it is lost in the twilight of fable. The republic of Venice came next in antiquity. But the republic of Venice was modern when compared with the Papacy; and the republic of Venice is gone, and the Papacy remains. The Papacy remains, not in decay, not a mere antique, but full of life and youthful vigour. The Catholic Church is still sending forth to the farthest ends of the world missionaries as zealous as those who landed in Kent with Augustin, and still confronting hostile kings with the same spirit with which she confronted Attila. The number of her children is greater than in any former age. Her acquisitions in the New World have more than compensated for what she has lost in the Old. Her spiritual ascendency extends over the vast countries which lie between the plains of the Missouri and Cape Horn, countries which a century hence, may not improbably contain a population as large as that which now inhabits Europe. The members of her communion are certainly not fewer than a hundred and fifty millions; and it will be difficult to show that all other Christian sects united amount to a hundred and twenty millions. Nor do we see any sign which indicates that the term of her long dominion is approaching. She saw the commencement of all the governments and of all the ecclesiastical establishments that now exist in the world; and we feel no assurance that she is not destined to see the end of them all. She was great and respected before the Saxon had set foot on Britain, before the Frank had passed the Rhine, when Grecian eloquence still flourished at Antioch, when idols were still worshipped in the temple of Mecca. And she may still exist in undiminished vigour when some traveller from New Zealand shall, in the midst of a vast solitude, take his stand on a broken arch of London Bridge to sketch the ruins of St. Paul's. We often hear it said that the world is constantly becoming more and more enlightened, and that this enlightening must be favourable to Protestantism, and unfavourable to Catholicism. We wish that we could think so. But we see great reason to doubt whether this be a well-founded expectation. We see that during the last two hundred and fifty years the human mind has been in the highest degree active, that it has made great advances in every branch of natural philosophy, that it has produced innumerable inventions tending to promote the convenience of life, that medicine, surgery, chemistry, engineering, have been very greatly improved, that government, police, and law have been improved, though not to so great an extent as the physical sciences. Yet we see that, during these two hundred and fifty years, Protestantism has made no conquests worth speaking of. Nay, we believe that, as far as there has been a change, that change has, on the whole, been in favour of the Church of Rome. We cannot, therefore, feel confident that the progress of knowledge will necessarily be fatal to a system which has, to say the least, stood its ground in spite of the immense progress made by the human race in knowledge since the days of Queen Elizabeth. Indeed the argument which we are considering, seems to us to be founded on an entire mistake. There are branches of knowledge with respect to which the law of the human mind is progress. In mathematics, when once a proposition has been demonstrated, it is never afterwards contested. Every fresh story is as solid a basis for a new superstructure as the original foundation was. Here, therefore, there is a constant addition to the stock of truth. In the inductive sciences again, the law is progress. Every day furnishes new facts, and thus brings theory nearer and nearer to perfection. There is no chance that, either in the purely demonstrative, or in the purely experimental sciences, the world will ever go back or even remain stationary. Nobody ever heard of a reaction against Taylor's theorem, or of a reaction against Harvey's doctrine of the circulation of the blood. But with theology the case is very different. As respects natural religion,--revelation being for the present altogether left out of the question,--it is not easy to see that a philosopher of the present day is more favourably situated than Thales or Simonides. He has before him just the same evidences of design in the structure of the universe which the early Greeks had. We say just the same; for the discoveries of modern astronomers and anatomists have really added nothing to the force of that argument which a reflecting mind finds in every beast, bird, insect, fish, leaf, flower and shell. The reasoning by which Socrates, in Xenophon's hearing, confuted the little atheist Aristodemus, is exactly the reasoning of Paley's Natural Theology. Socrates makes precisely the same use of the statues of Polycletus and the pictures of Zeuxis which Paley makes of the watch. As to the other great question, the question, what becomes of man after death, we do not see that a highly educated European, left to his unassisted reason, is more likely to be in the right than a Blackfoot Indian. Not a single one of the many sciences in which we surpass the Blackfoot Indians throws the smallest light on the state of the soul after the animal life is extinct. In truth all the philosophers, ancient and modern, who have attempted, without the help of revelation to prove the immortality of man, from Plato down to Franklin, appear to us to have failed deplorably. Then, again, all the great enigmas which perplex the natural theologian are the same in all ages. The ingenuity of a people just emerging from barbarism is quite sufficient to propound those enigmas. The genius of Locke or Clarke is quite unable to solve them. It is a mistake to imagine that subtle speculations touching the Divine attributes, the origin of evil, the necessity of human actions, the foundation of moral obligation, imply any high degree of intellectual culture. Such speculations, on the contrary, are in a peculiar manner the delight of intelligent children and of half civilised men. The number of boys is not small who, at fourteen, have thought enough on these questions to be fully entitled to the praise which Voltaire gives to Zadig. "Il en savait ce qu'on en a su dans tous les ages; c'est-a-dire, fort peu de chose." The book of Job shows that, long before letters and arts were known to Ionia, these vexing questions were debated with no common skill and eloquence, under the tents of the Idumean Emirs; nor has human reason, in the course of three thousand years, discovered any satisfactory solution of the riddles which perplexed Eliphaz and Zophar. Natural theology, then, is not a progressive science. That knowledge of our origin and of our destiny which we derive from revelation is indeed of very different clearness, and of very different importance. But neither is revealed religion of the nature of a progressive science. All Divine truth is, according to the doctrine of the Protestant Churches, recorded in certain books. It is equally open to all who, in any age, can read those books; nor can all the discoveries of all the philosophers in the world add a single verse to any of those books. It is plain, therefore, that in divinity there cannot be a progress analogous to that which is constantly taking place in pharmacy, geology, and navigation. A Christian of the fifth Century with a Bible is neither better nor worse situated than a Christian of the nineteenth century with a Bible, candour and natural acuteness being, of course, supposed equal. It matters not at all that the compass, printing, gunpowder, steam, gas, vaccination, and a thousand other discoveries and inventions, which were unknown in the fifth century, are familiar to the nineteenth. None of these discoveries and inventions has the smallest bearing on the question whether man is justified by faith alone, or whether the invocation of saints is an orthodox practice. It seems to us, therefore, that we have no security for the future against the prevalence of any theological error that ever has prevailed in time past among Christian men. We are confident that the world will never go back to the solar system of Ptolemy; nor is our confidence in the least shaken by the circumstance, that even so great a man as Bacon rejected the theory of Galileo with scorn; for Bacon had not all the means of arriving at a sound conclusion which are within our reach, and which secure people who would not have been worthy to mend his pens from falling into his mistakes. But when we reflect that Sir Thomas More was ready to die for the doctrine of transubstantiation, we cannot but feel some doubt whether the doctrine of transubstantiation may not triumph over all opposition. More was a man of eminent talents. He had all the information on the subject that we have, or that, while the world lasts, any human being will have. The text, "This is my body," was in his New Testament as it is in ours. The absurdity of the literal interpretation was as great and as obvious in the sixteenth century as it is now. No progress that science has made, or will make, can add to what seems to us the overwhelming force of the argument against the real presence. We are, therefore, unable to understand why what Sir Thomas More believed respecting transubstantiation may not be believed to the end of time by men equal in abilities and honesty to Sir Thomas More. But Sir Thomas More is one of the choice specimens of human wisdom and virtue; and the doctrine of transubstantiation is a kind of proof charge. A faith which stands that test will stand any test. The prophecies of Brothers and the miracles of Prince Hohenlohe sink to trifles in the comparison. One reservation, indeed, must be made. The books and traditions of a sect may contain, mingled with propositions strictly theological, other propositions, purporting to rest on the same authority, which relate to physics. If new discoveries should throw discredit on the physical propositions, the theological propositions, unless they can be separated from the physical propositions, will share in that discredit. In this way, undoubtedly, the progress of science may indirectly serve the cause of religious truth. The Hindoo mythology, for example, is bound up with a most absurd geography. Every young Brahmin, therefore, who learns geography in our colleges learns to smile at the Hindoo mythology. If Catholicism has not suffered to an equal degree from the Papal decision that the sun goes round the earth, this is because all intelligent Catholics now hold, with Pascal, that, in deciding the point at all, the Church exceeded her powers, and was, therefore, justly left destitute of that supernatural assistance which, in the exercise of her legitimate functions, the promise of her Founder authorised her to expect. This reservation affects not at all the truth of our proposition, that divinity, properly so called, is not a progressive science. A very common knowledge of history, a very little observation of life, will suffice to prove that no learning, no sagacity, affords a security against the greatest errors on subjects relating to the invisible world. Bayle and Chillingworth, two of the most sceptical of mankind, turned Catholics from sincere conviction. Johnson, incredulous on all other points, was a ready believer in miracles and apparitions. He would not believe in Ossian; but he was willing to believe in the second sight. He would not believe in the earthquake of Lisbon; but he was willing to believe in the Cock Lane ghost. For these reasons we have ceased to wonder at any vagaries of superstition. We have seen men, not of mean intellect or neglected education, but qualified by their talents and acquirements to attain eminence either in active or speculative pursuits, well-read scholars, expert logicians, keen observers of life and manners, prophesying, interpreting, talking unknown tongues, working miraculous cures, coming down with messages from God to the House of Commons. We have seen an old woman, with no talents beyond the cunning of a fortune-teller, and with the education of a scullion, exalted into a prophetess, and surrounded by tens of thousands of devoted followers, many of whom were, in station and knowledge, immeasurably her superiors; and all this in the nineteenth century; and all this in London. Yet why not? For of the dealings of God with man no more has been revealed to the nineteenth century than to the first, or to London than to the wildest parish in the Hebrides. It is true that, in those things which concern this life and this world, man constantly becomes wiser and wiser. But it is no less true that, as respects a higher power and a future state, man, in the language of Goethe's scoffing friend,           "bleibt stets von gleichem Schlag, Und ist so wunderlich als wie am ersten Tag." The history of Catholicism strikingly illustrates these observations. During the last seven centuries the public mind of Europe has made constant progress in every department of secular knowledge. But in religion we can trace no constant progress. The ecclesiastical history of that long period is a history of movement to and fro. Four times, since the authority of the Church of Rome was established in Western Christendom, has the human intellect risen up against her yoke. Twice that Church remained completely victorious. Twice she came forth from the conflict bearing the marks of cruel wounds, but with the principle of life still strong within her. When we reflect on the tremendous assaults which she has survived, we find it difficult to conceive in what way she is to perish. The first of these insurrections broke out in the region where the beautiful language of Oc was spoken. That country, singularly favoured by nature, was, in the twelfth century, the most flourishing and civilised portion of Western Europe. It was in no wise a part of France. It had a distinct political existence, a distinct national character, distinct usages, and a distinct speech. The soil was fruitful and well cultivated; and amidst the cornfields and vineyards arose many rich cities each of which was a little republic, and many stately castles: each of which contained a miniature of an imperial court. It was there that the spirit of chivalry first laid aside its terrors, first took a humane and graceful form, first appeared as the inseparable associate of art and literature, of courtesy and love. The other vernacular dialects which, since the fifth century, had sprung up in the ancient provinces of the Roman empire, were still rude and imperfect. The sweet Tuscan, the rich and energetic English, were abandoned to artisans and shepherds. No clerk had ever condescended to use such barbarous jargon for the teaching of science, for the recording of great events, or for the painting of life and manners. But the language of Provence was already the language of the learned and polite, and was employed by numerous writers, studious of all the arts of composition and versification. A literature rich in ballads, in war-songs, in satire, and, above all, in amatory poetry amused the leisure of the knights and ladies whose fortified mansions adorned the banks of the Rhone and Garonne. With civilisation had come freedom of thought. Use had taken away the horror with which misbelievers were elsewhere regarded. No Norman or Breton ever saw a Mussulman, except to give and receive blows on some Syrian field of battle. But the people of the rich countries which lay under the Pyrenees lived in habits of courteous and profitable intercourse with the Moorish kingdoms of Spain, and gave a hospitable welcome to skilful leeches and mathematicians who, in the schools of Cordova and Granada, had become versed in all the learning of the Arabians. The Greek, still preserving, in the midst of political degradation, the ready wit and the inquiring spirit of his fathers, still able to read the most perfect of human compositions, still speaking the most powerful and flexible of human languages, brought to the marts of Narbonne and Toulouse, together with the drugs and silks of remote climates, bold and subtle theories long unknown to the ignorant and credulous West. The Paulician theology, a theology in which, as it should seem, many of the doctrines of the modern Calvinists were mingled with some doctrines derived from the ancient Manichees, spread rapidly through Provence and Languedoc. The clergy of the Catholic Church were regarded with loathing and contempt. "Viler than a priest," "I would as soon be a priest," became proverbial expressions. The Papacy had lost all authority with all classes, from the great feudal princes down to the cultivators of the soil. The danger to the hierarchy was indeed formidable. Only one transalpine nation had emerged from barbarism; and that nation had thrown off all respect for Rome. Only one of the vernacular languages of Europe had yet been extensively employed for literary purposes; and that language was a machine in the hands of heretics. The geographical position of the sectaries made the danger peculiarly formidable. They occupied a central region communicating directly with France, with Italy, and with Spain. The provinces which were still untainted were separated from each other by this infected district. Under these circumstances, it seemed probable that a single generation would suffice to spread the reformed doctrine to Lisbon, to London, and to Naples. But this was not to be. Rome cried for help to the warriors of northern France. She appealed at once to their superstition and to their cupidity. To the devout believer she promised pardons as ample as those with which she had rewarded the deliverers of the Holy Sepulchre. To the rapacious and profligate she offered the plunder of fertile plains and wealthy cities. Unhappily, the ingenious and polished inhabitants of the Languedocian provinces were far better qualified to enrich and embellish their country than to defend it. Eminent in the arts of peace, unrivalled in the "gay science," elevated above many vulgar superstitions, they wanted that iron courage, and that skill in martial exercises, which distinguished the chivalry of the region beyond the Loire, and were ill fitted to face enemies who, in every country from Ireland to Palestine, had been victorious against tenfold odds. A war, distinguished even among wars of religion by merciless atrocity, destroyed the Albigensian heresy, and with that heresy the prosperity the civilisation, the literature, the national existence, of what was once the most opulent and enlightened part of the great European family. Rome, in the meantime, warned by that fearful danger from which the exterminating swords of her crusaders had narrowly saved her, proceeded to revise and to strengthen her whole system of polity. At this period were instituted the Order of Francis, the Order of Dominic, the Tribunal of the Inquisition. The new spiritual police was everywhere. No alley in a great city, no hamlet on a remote mountain, was unvisited by the begging friar. The simple Catholic, who was content to be no wiser than his fathers, found, wherever he turned, a friendly voice to encourage him. The path of the heretic was beset by innumerable spies; and the Church, lately in danger of utter subversion, now appeared to be impregnably fortified by the love, the reverence, and the terror of mankind. A century and a half passed away; and then came the second great rising up of the human intellect against the spiritual domination of Rome. During the two generations which followed the Albigensian crusade, the power of the Papacy had been at the height. Frederic the Second, the ablest and most accomplished of the long line of German Caesars, had in vain exhausted all the resources of military and political skill in the attempt to defend the rights of the civil power against the encroachments of the Church. The vengeance of the priesthood had pursued his house to the third generation. Manfred had perished on the field of battle, Conradin on the scaffold. Then a turn took place. The secular authority, long unduly depressed, regained the ascendant with startling rapidity. The change is doubtless to be ascribed chiefly to the general disgust excited by the way in which the Church had abused its power and its success. But something must be attributed to the character and situation of individuals. The man who bore the chief part in effecting this revolution was Philip the Fourth of France, surnamed the Beautiful, a despot by position, a despot by temperament, stern, implacable, and unscrupulous, equally prepared for violence and for chicanery, and surrounded by a devoted band of men of the sword and of men of law. The fiercest and most high minded of the Roman Pontiffs, while bestowing kingdoms and citing great princes to his judgment-seat, was seized in his palace by armed men, and so foully outraged that he died mad with rage and terror. "Thus," sang the great Florentine poet, "was Christ, in the person of his vicar, a second time seized by ruffians, a second time mocked, a second time drenched with the vinegar and the gall." The seat of the Papal court was carried beyond the Alps, and the Bishops of Rome became dependants of France. Then came the great schism of the West. Two Popes, each with a doubtful title, made all Europe ring with their mutual invectives and anathemas. Rome cried out against the corruptions of Avignon; and Avignon, with equal justice, recriminated on Rome. The plain Christian people, brought up in the belief that it was a sacred duty to be in communion with the head of the Church, were unable to discover, amidst conflicting testimonies and conflicting arguments, to which of the two worthless priests who were cursing and reviling each other, the headship of the Church rightfully belonged. It was nearly at this juncture that the voice of John Wickliffe began to make itself heard. The public mind of England was soon stirred to its inmost depths: and the influence of the new doctrines was soon felt, even in the distant kingdom of Bohemia. In Bohemia, indeed, there had long been a predisposition to heresy. Merchants from the Lower Danube were often seen in the fairs of Prague; and the Lower Danube was peculiarly the seat of the Paulician theology. The Church, torn by schism, and fiercely assailed at once in England and in the German Empire, was in a situation scarcely less perilous than at the crisis which preceded the Albigensian crusade. But this danger also passed by. The civil power gave its strenuous support to the Church; and the Church made some show of reforming itself. The Council of Constance put an end to the schism. The whole Catholic world was again united under a single chief; and rules were laid down which seemed to make it improbable that the power of that chief would be grossly abused. The most distinguished teachers of the new doctrine were slaughtered. The English Government put down the Lollards with merciless rigour; and in the next generation, scarcely one trace of the second great revolt against the Papacy could be found, except among the rude population of the mountains of Bohemia. Another century went by; and then began the third and the most memorable struggle for spiritual freedom. The times were changed. The great remains of Athenian and Roman genius were studied by thousands. The Church had no longer a monopoly of learning. The powers of the modern languages had at length been developed. The invention of printing had given new facilities to the intercourse of mind with mind. With such auspices commenced the great Reformation. We will attempt to lay before our readers, in a short compass, what appears to us to be the real history of the contest which began with the preaching of Luther against the Indulgences, and which may, in one sense, be said, to have been terminated, a hundred and thirty years later, by the treaty of Westphalia. In the northern parts of Europe the victory of Protestantism was rapid and decisive. The dominion of the Papacy was felt by the nations of Teutonic blood as the dominion of Italians, of foreigners, of men who were aliens in language, manners, and intellectual constitution. The large jurisdiction exercised by the spiritual tribunals of Rome seemed to be a degrading badge of servitude. The sums which, under a thousand pretexts, were exacted by a distant court, were regarded both as a humiliating and as a ruinous tribute. The character of that court excited the scorn and disgust of a grave, earnest, sincere, and devout people. The new theology spread with a rapidity never known before. All ranks, all varieties of character, joined the ranks of the innovators. Sovereigns impatient to appropriate to themselves the prerogatives of the Pope, nobles desirous to share the plunder of abbeys, suitors exasperated by the extortions of the Roman Camera, patriots impatient of a foreign rule, good men scandalised by the corruptions of the Church, bad men desirous of the licence inseparable from great moral revolutions, wise men eager in the pursuit of truth, weak men allured by the glitter of novelty, all were found on one side. Alone among the northern nations the Irish adhered to the ancient faith: and the cause of this seems to have been that the national feeling which, in happier countries, was directed against Rome, was in Ireland directed against England. Within fifty years from the day on which Luther publicly renounced communion with the Papacy, and burned the bull of Leo before the gates of Wittenberg, Protestantism attained its highest ascendency, an ascendency which it soon lost, and which it has never regained. Hundreds, who could well remember Brother Martin a devout Catholic, lived to see the revolution of which he was the chief author, victorious in half the states of Europe. In England, Scotland, Denmark, Sweden, Livonia, Prussia, Saxony, Hesse, Wurtemburg, the Palatinate, in several cantons of Switzerland, in the Northern Netherlands, the Reformation had completely triumphed; and in all the other countries on this side of the Alps and the Pyrenees, it seemed on the point of triumphing. But while this mighty work was proceeding in the north of Europe, a revolution of a very different kind had taken place in the south. The temper of Italy and Spain was widely different from that of Germany and England. As the national feeling of the Teutonic nations impelled them to throw off the Italian supremacy, so the national feeling of the Italians impelled them to resist any change which might deprive their country of the honours and advantages which she enjoyed as the seat of the government of the Universal Church. It was in Italy that the tributes were spent of which foreign nations so bitterly complained. It was to adorn Italy that the traffic in Indulgences had been carried to that scandalous excess which had roused the indignation of Luther. There was among the Italians both much piety and much impiety; but, with very few exceptions, neither the piety nor the impiety took the turn of Protestantism. The religious Italians desired a reform of morals and discipline, but not a reform of doctrine, and least of all a schism. The irreligious Italians simply disbelieved Christianity, without hating it. They looked at it as artists or as statesmen; and, so looking at it, they liked it better in the established form than in any other. It was to them what the old Pagan worship was to Trajan and Pliny. Neither the spirit of Savonarola nor the spirit of Machiavelli had anything in common with the spirit of the religious or political Protestants of the North. Spain again was, with respect to the Catholic Church, in a situation very different from that of the Teutonic nations. Italy was, in truth, a part of the empire of Charles the Fifth; and the Court of Rome was, on many important occasions, his tool. He had not, therefore, like the distant princes of the North, a strong selfish motive for attacking the Papacy. In fact, the very measures which provoked the Sovereign of England to renounce all connection with Rome were dictated by the Sovereign of Spain. The feeling of the Spanish people concurred with the interest of the Spanish Government. The attachment of the Castilian to the faith of his ancestors was peculiarly strong and ardent. With that faith were inseparably bound up the institutions, the independence, and the glory of his country. Between the day when the last Gothic king was vanquished on the banks of the Xeres, and the day when Ferdinand and Isabella entered Granada in triumph, near eight hundred years had elapsed; and during those years the Spanish nation had been engaged in a desperate struggle against misbelievers. The Crusades had been merely an episode in the history of other nations. The existence of Spain had been one long Crusade. After fighting Mussulmans in the Old World, she began to fight heathens in the New. It was under the authority of a Papal bull that her children steered into unknown seas. It was under the standard of the cross that they marched fearlessly into the heart of great kingdoms. It was with the cry of "St. James for Spain," that they charged armies which outnumbered them a hundredfold. And men said that the Saint had heard the call, and had himself, in arms, on a grey war-horse, led the onset before which the worshippers of false gods had given way. After the battle, every excess of rapacity or cruelty was sufficiently vindicated by the plea that the sufferers were unbaptized. Avarice stimulated zeal. Zeal consecrated avarice. Proselytes and gold mines were sought with equal ardour. In the very year in which the Saxons, maddened by the exactions of Rome, broke loose from her yoke, the Spaniards, under the authority of Rome, made themselves masters of the empire and of the treasures of Montezuma. Thus Catholicism which, in the public mind of Northern Europe, was associated with spoliation and oppression, was in the public mind of Spain associated with liberty, victory, dominion, wealth, and glory. It is not, therefore, strange that the effect of the great outbreak of Protestantism in one part of Christendom should have been to produce an equally violent outbreak of Catholic zeal in another. Two reformations were pushed on at once with equal energy and effect, a reformation of doctrine in the North, a reformation of manners and discipline in the South. In the course of a single generation, the whole spirit of the Church of Rome underwent a change. From the halls of the Vatican to the most secluded hermitage of the Apennines, the great revival was everywhere felt and seen. All the institutions anciently devised for the propagation and defence of the faith were furbished up and made efficient. Fresh engines of still more formidable power were constructed. Everywhere old religious communities were remodelled and new religious communities called into existence. Within a year after the death of Leo, the order of Camaldoli was purified. The Capuchins restored the old Franciscan discipline, the midnight prayer and the life of silence. The Barnabites and the society of Somasca devoted themselves to the relief and education of the poor. To the Theatine order a still higher interest belongs. Its great object was the same with that of our early Methodists, namely to supply the deficiencies of the parochial clergy. The Church of Rome, wiser than the Church of England, gave every countenance to the good work. The members of the new brotherhood preached to great multitudes in the streets and in the fields, prayed by the beds of the sick, and administered the last sacraments to the dying. Foremost among them in zeal and devotion was Gian Pietro Caraffa, afterwards Pope Paul the Fourth. In the convent of the Theatines at Venice, under the eye of Caraffa, a Spanish gentleman took up his abode, tended the poor in the hospitals, went about in rags, starved himself almost to death, and often sallied into the streets, mounted on stones, and, waving his hat to invite the passers-by, began to preach in a strange jargon of mingled Castilian and Tuscan. The Theatines were among the most zealous and rigid of men; but to this enthusiastic neophyte their discipline seemed lax, and their movements sluggish; for his own mind, naturally passionate and imaginative, had passed through a training which had given to all its peculiarities a morbid intensity and energy. In his early life he had been the very prototype of the hero of Cervantes. The single study of the young Hidalgo had been chivalrous romance; and his existence had been one gorgeous day- dream of princesses rescued and infidels subdued. He had chosen a Dulcinea, "no countess, no duchess,"--these are his own words,-- "but one of far higher station"; and he flattered himself with the hope of laying at her feet the keys of Moorish castles and the jewelled turbans of Asiatic kings. In the midst of these visions of martial glory and prosperous love, a severe wound stretched him on a bed of sickness. His constitution was shattered and he was doomed to be a cripple for life. The palm of strength, grace, and skill in knightly exercises, was no longer for him. He could no longer hope to strike down gigantic soldans, or to find favour in the sight of beautiful women. A new vision then arose in his mind, and mingled itself with his old delusions in a manner which to most Englishmen must seem singular, but which those who know how close was the union between religion and chivalry in Spain will be at no loss to understand. He would still be a soldier; he would still be a knight errant; but the soldier and knight errant of the spouse of Christ. He would smite the Great Red Dragon. He would be the champion of the Woman clothed with the Sun. He would break the charm under which false prophets held the souls of men in bondage. His restless spirit led him to the Syrian deserts, and to the chapel of the Holy Sepulchre. Thence he wandered back to the farthest West, and astonished the convents of Spain and the schools of France by his penances and vigils. The same lively imagination which had been employed in picturing the tumult of unreal battles, and the charms of unreal queens, now peopled his solitude with saints and angels. The Holy Virgin descended to commune with him. He saw the Saviour face to face with the eye of flesh. Even those mysteries of religion which are the hardest trial of faith were in his case palpable to sight. It is difficult to relate without a pitying smile that, in the sacrifice of the mass, he saw transubstantiation take place, and that, as he stood praying on the steps of the Church of St. Dominic, he saw the Trinity in Unity, and wept aloud with joy and wonder. Such was the celebrated Ignatius Loyola, who, in the great Catholic reaction, bore the same part which Luther bore in the great Protestant movement. Dissatisfied with the system of the Theatines, the enthusiastic Spaniard turned his face towards Rome. Poor, obscure, without a patron, without recommendations, he entered the city where now two princely temples, rich with painting and many-coloured marble, commemorate his great services to the Church; where his form stands sculptured in massive silver; where his bones, enshrined amidst jewels, are placed beneath the altar of God. His activity and zeal bore down all opposition; and under his rule the order of Jesuits began to exist, and grew rapidly to the full measure of his gigantic powers. With what vehemence, with what policy, with what exact discipline, with what dauntless courage, with what self-denial, with what forgetfulness of the dearest private ties, with what intense and stubborn devotion to a single end, with what unscrupulous laxity and versatility in the choice of means, the Jesuits fought the battle of their Church, is written in every page of the annals of Europe during several generations. In the order of Jesus was concentrated the quintessence of the Catholic spirit; and the history of the order of Jesus is the history of the great Catholic reaction. That order possessed itself at once of all the strongholds which command the public mind, of the pulpit, of the press, of the confessional, of the academies. Wherever the Jesuit preached, the church was too small for the audience. The name of Jesuit on a title-page secured the circulation of a book. It was in the ears of the Jesuit that the powerful, the noble, and the beautiful, breathed the secret history of their lives. It was at the feet of the Jesuit that the youth of the higher and middle classes were brought up from childhood to manhood, from the first rudiments to the courses of rhetoric and philosophy. Literature and science, lately associated with infidelity or with heresy, now became the allies of orthodoxy. Dominant in the South of Europe, the great order soon went forth conquering and to conquer. In spite of oceans and deserts, of hunger and pestilence, of spies and penal laws, of dungeons and racks, of gibbets and quartering-blocks, Jesuits were to be found under every disguise, and in every country; scholars, physicians, merchants, serving-men; in the hostile Court of Sweden, in the old manor-houses of Cheshire, among the hovels of Connaught; arguing, instructing, consoling, stealing away the hearts of the young, animating the courage of the timid, holding up the crucifix before the eyes of the dying. Nor was it less their office to plot against the thrones and lives of apostate kings, to spread evil rumours, to raise tumults, to inflame civil wars, to arm the hand of the assassin. Inflexible in nothing but in their fidelity to the Church, they were equally ready to appeal in her cause to the spirit of loyalty and to the spirit of freedom. Extreme doctrines of obedience and extreme doctrines of liberty, the right of rulers to misgovern the people, the right of every one of the people to plunge his knife in the heart of a bad ruler, were inculcated by the same man, according as he addressed himself to the subject of Philip or to the subject of Elizabeth. Some described these divines as the most rigid, others as the most indulgent of spiritual directors; and both descriptions were correct. The truly devout listened with awe to the high and saintly morality of the Jesuit. The gay cavalier who had run his rival through the body, the frail beauty who had forgotten her marriage-vow, found in the Jesuit an easy well-bred man of the world, who knew how to make allowance for the little irregularities of people of fashion. The confessor was strict or lax, according to the temper of the penitent. The first object was to drive no person out of the pale of the Church. Since there were bad people, it was better that they should be bad Catholics than bad Protestants. If a person was so unfortunate as to be a bravo, a libertine, or a gambler, that was no reason for making him a heretic too. The Old World was not wide enough for this strange activity. The Jesuits invaded all the countries which the great maritime discoveries of the preceding age had laid open to European enterprise. They were to be found in the depths of the Peruvian mines, at the marts of the African slave-caravans, on the shores of the Spice Islands, in the observatories of China. They made converts in regions which neither avarice nor curiosity had tempted any of their countrymen to enter; and preached and disputed in tongues of which no other native of the West understood a word. The spirit which appeared so eminently in this order animated the whole Catholic world. The Court of Rome itself was purified. During the generation which preceded the Reformation, that Court had been a scandal to the Christian name. Its annals are black with treason, murder, and incest. Even its more respectable members were utterly unfit to be ministers of religion. They were men like Leo the Tenth; men who, with the Latinity of the Augustan age, had acquired its atheistical and scoffing spirit. They regarded those Christian mysteries, of which they were stewards, just as the Augur Cicero and the high Pontiff Caesar regarded the Sibylline books and the pecking of the sacred chickens. Among themselves, they spoke of the Incarnation, the Eucharist, and the Trinity, in the same tone in which Cotta and Velleius talked of the oracle of Delphi or the voice of Faunus in the mountains. Their years glided by in a soft dream of sensual and intellectual voluptuousness. Choice cookery, delicious wines, lovely women, hounds, falcons, horses, newly-discovered manuscripts of the classics, sonnets, and burlesque romances in the sweetest Tuscan, just as licentious as a fine sense of the graceful would permit, plate from the hand of Benvenuto, designs for palaces by Michael Angelo, frescoes by Raphael, busts, mosaics, and gems just dug up from among the ruins of ancient temples and villas, these things were the delight and even the serious business of their lives. Letters and the fine arts undoubtedly owe much to this not inelegant sloth. But when the great stirring of the mind of Europe began, when doctrine after doctrine was assailed, when nation after nation withdrew from communion with the successor of St. Peter, it was felt that the Church could not be safely confided to chiefs whose highest praise was that they were good judges of Latin compositions, of paintings, and of statues, whose severest studies had a pagan character, and who were suspected of laughing in secret at the sacraments which they administered, and of believing no more of the Gospel than of the Morgante Maggiore. Men of a very different class now rose to the direction of ecclesiastical affairs, men whose spirit resembled that of Dunstan and of Becket. The Roman Pontiffs exhibited in their own persons all the austerity of the early anchorites of Syria. Paul the Fourth brought to the Papal throne the same fervent zeal which had carried him into the Theatine convent. Pius the Fifth, under his gorgeous vestments, wore day and night the hair shirt of a simple friar, walked barefoot in the streets at the head of processions, found, even in the midst of his most pressing avocations, time for private prayer, often regretted that the public duties of his station were unfavourable to growth in holiness, and edified his flock by innumerable instances of humility, charity, and forgiveness of personal injuries, while at the same time he upheld the authority of his see, and the unadulterated doctrines of his Church, with all the stubbornness and vehemence of Hildebrand. Gregory the Thirteenth exerted himself not only to imitate but to surpass Pius in the severe virtues of his sacred profession. As was the head, such were the members. The change in the spirit of the Catholic world may be traced in every walk of literature and of art. It will be at once perceived by every person who compares the poem of Tasso with that of Ariosto, or the monuments Of Sixtus the Fifth with those of Leo the Tenth. But it was not on moral influence alone that the Catholic Church relied. The civil sword in Spain and Italy was unsparingly employed in her support. The Inquisition was armed with new powers and inspired with a new energy. If Protestantism, or the semblance of Protestantism, showed itself in any quarter, it was instantly met, not by petty, teasing persecution, but by persecution of that sort which bows down and crushes all but a very few select spirits. Whoever was suspected of heresy, whatever his rank, his learning, or his reputation, knew that he must purge himself to the satisfaction of a severe and vigilant tribunal, or die by fire. Heretical books were sought out and destroyed with similar rigour. Works which were once in every house were so effectually suppressed that no copy of them is now to be found in the most extensive libraries. One book in particular, entitled Of the Benefits of the Death of Christ, had this fate. It was written in Tuscan, was many times reprinted, and was eagerly read in every part of Italy. But the inquisitors detected in it the Lutheran doctrine of justification by faith alone. They proscribed it; and it is now as hopelessly lost as the second decade of Livy. Thus, while the Protestant reformation proceeded rapidly at one extremity of Europe, the Catholic revival went on as rapidly at the other. About half a century after the great separation, there were, throughout the North, Protestant governments and Protestant nations. In the South were governments and nations actuated by the most intense zeal for the ancient Church. Between these two hostile regions lay, morally as well as geographically, a great debatable land. In France, Belgium, Southern Germany, Hungary, and Poland, the contest was still undecided. The governments of those countries had not renounced their connection with Rome; but the Protestants were numerous, powerful, bold, and active. In France, they formed a commonwealth within the realm, held fortresses, were able to bring great armies into the field, and had treated with their sovereign on terms of equality. In Poland, the King was still a Catholic; but the Protestants had the upper hand in the Diet, filled the chief offices in the administration, and, in the large towns, took possession of the parish churches. "It appeared," says the Papal nuncio, "that in Poland, Protestantism would completely supersede Catholicism." In Bavaria, the state of things was nearly the same. The Protestants had a majority in the Assembly of the States, and demanded from the duke concessions in favour of their religion, as the price of their subsidies. In Transylvania, the House of Austria was unable to prevent the Diet from confiscating, by one sweeping decree, the estates of the Church. In Austria Proper it was generally said that only one-thirtieth part of the population could be counted on as good Catholics. In Belgium the adherents of the new opinions were reckoned by hundreds of thousands. The history of the two succeeding generations is the history of the struggle between Protestantism possessed of the North of Europe, and Catholicism possessed of the South, for the doubtful territory which lay between. All the weapons of carnal and of spiritual warfare were employed. Both sides may boast of great talents and of great virtues. Both have to blush for many follies and crimes. At first, the chances seemed to be decidedly in favour of Protestantism; but the victory remained with the Church of Rome. On every point she was successful. If we overleap, another half century, we find her victorious and dominant in France, Belgium, Bavaria, Bohemia, Austria, Poland, and Hungary. Nor has Protestantism, in the course of two hundred years, been able to reconquer any portion of what was then lost. It is, moreover, not to be dissembled that this triumph of the Papacy is to be chiefly attributed, not to the force of arms, but to a great reflux in public opinion. During the first half century after the commencement of the Reformation, the current of feeling, in the countries on this side of the Alps and of the Pyrenees, ran impetuously towards the new doctrines. Then the tide turned, and rushed as fiercely in the opposite direction. Neither during the one period, nor during the other, did much depend upon the event of battles or sieges. The Protestant movement was hardly checked for an instant by the defeat at Muhlberg. The Catholic reaction went on at full speed in spite of the destruction of the Armada. It is difficult to say whether the violence of the first blow or of the recoil was the greater. Fifty years after the Lutheran separation, Catholicism could scarcely maintain itself on the shores of the Mediterranean. A hundred years after the separation, Protestantism could scarcely maintain itself on the shores of the Baltic. The causes of this memorable turn in human affairs well deserve to be investigated. The contest between the two parties bore some resemblance to the fencing-match in Shakspeare; "Laertes wounds Hamlet; then, in scuffling, they change rapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes." The war between Luther and Leo was a war between firm faith and unbelief, between zeal and apathy, between energy and indolence, between seriousness and frivolity, between a pure morality and vice. Very different was the war which degenerate Protestantism had to wage against regenerate Catholicism. To the debauchees, the poisoners, the atheists, who had worn the tiara during the generation which preceded the Reformation, had succeeded Popes who, in religious fervour and severe sanctity of manners, might bear a comparison with Cyprian or Ambrose. The order of Jesuits alone could show many men not inferior in sincerity, constancy, courage, and austerity of life, to the apostles of the Reformation. But while danger had thus called forth in the bosom of the Church of Rome many of the highest qualities of the Reformers, the Reformers had contracted some of the corruptions which had been justly censured in the Church of Rome. They had become lukewarm and worldly. Their great old leaders had been borne to the grave, and had left no successors. Among the Protestant princes there was little or no hearty Protestant feeling. Elizabeth herself was a Protestant rather from policy than from firm conviction. James the First, in order to effect his favourite object of marrying his son into one of the great continental houses, was ready to make immense concessions to Rome, and even to admit a modified primacy in the Pope. Henry the Fourth twice abjured the reformed doctrines from interested motives. The Elector of Saxony, the natural head Of the Protestant party in Germany, submitted to become, at the most important crisis of the struggle, a tool in the hands of the Papists. Among the Catholic sovereigns, on the other hand, we find a religious zeal often amounting to fanaticism. Philip the Second was a Papist in a very different sense from that in which Elizabeth was a Protestant. Maximilian of Bavaria, brought up under the teaching of the Jesuits, was a fervent missionary wielding the powers of a prince. The Emperor Ferdinand the Second deliberately put his throne to hazard over and over again, rather than make the smallest concession to the spirit of religious innovation. Sigismund of Sweden lost a crown which he might have preserved if he would have renounced the Catholic faith. In short, everywhere on the Protestant side we see languor; everywhere on the Catholic side we see ardour and devotion. Not only was there, at this time, a much more intense zeal among the Catholics than among the Protestants; but the whole zeal of the Catholics was directed against the Protestants, while almost the whole zeal of the Protestants was directed against each other. Within the Catholic Church there were no serious disputes on points of doctrine. The decisions of the Council of Trent were received; and the Jansenian controversy had not yet arisen. The whole force of Rome was, therefore, effective for the purpose of carrying on the war against the Reformation. On the other hand, the force which ought to have fought the battle of the Reformation was exhausted in civil conflict. While Jesuit preachers, Jesuit confessors, Jesuit teachers of youth, overspread Europe, eager to expend every faculty of their minds and every drop of their blood in the cause of their Church, Protestant doctors were confuting, and Protestant rulers were punishing, sectaries who were just as good Protestants as themselves. "Cumque superba foret BABYLON spolianda tropaeis, Bella geri placuit nullos habitura triumphos." In the Palatinate, a Calvinistic prince persecuted the Lutherans. In Saxony, a Lutheran prince persecuted the Calvinists. Everybody who objected to any of the articles of the Confession of Augsburg was banished from Sweden. In Scotland, Melville was disputing with other Protestants on questions of ecclesiastical government. In England the gaols were filled with men, who, though zealous for the Reformation, did not exactly agree with the Court on all points of discipline and doctrine. Some were persecuted for denying the tenet of reprobation; some for not wearing surplices. The Irish people might at that time have been, in all probability, reclaimed from Popery, at the expense of half the zeal and activity which Whitgift employed in oppressing Puritans, and Martin Marprelate in reviling bishops. As the Catholics in zeal and in union had a great advantage over the Protestants, so had they also an infinitely superior organisation. In truth, Protestantism, for aggressive purposes, had no organisation at all. The Reformed Churches were mere national Churches. The Church of England existed for England alone. It was an institution as purely local as the Court of Common Pleas, and was utterly without any machinery for foreign operations. The Church of Scotland, in the same manner, existed for Scotland alone. The operations of the Catholic Church, on the other hand, took in the whole world. Nobody at Lambeth or at Edinburgh troubled himself about what was doing in Poland or Bavaria. But Cracow and Munich were at Rome objects of as much interest as the purlieus of St. John Lateran. Our island, the head of the Protestant interest, did not send out a single missionary or a single instructor of youth to the scene of the great spiritual war. Not a single seminary was established here for the purpose of furnishing a supply of such persons to foreign countries. On the other hand, Germany, Hungary, and Poland were filled with able and active Catholic emissaries of Spanish or Italian birth; and colleges for the instruction of the northern youth were founded at Rome. The spiritual force of Protestantism was a mere local militia, which might be useful in case of an invasion, but could not be sent abroad, and could therefore make no conquests. Rome had such a local militia; but she had also a force disposable at a moment's notice for foreign service, however dangerous or disagreeable. If it was thought at head- quarters that a Jesuit at Palermo was qualified by his talents and character to withstand the Reformers in Lithuania, the order was instantly given and instantly obeyed. In a month, the faithful servant of the Church was preaching, catechising, confessing, beyond the Niemen. It is impossible to deny that the polity of the Church of Rome is the very master-piece of human wisdom. In truth, nothing but such a polity could, against such assaults, have borne up such doctrines. The experience of twelve hundred eventful years, the ingenuity and patient care of forty generations of statesmen, have improved that polity to such perfection that, among the contrivances which have been devised for deceiving and oppressing mankind, it occupies the highest place. The stronger our conviction that reason and scripture were decidedly on the side of Protestantism, the greater is the reluctant admiration with which we regard that system of tactics against which reason and scripture were employed in vain. If we went at large into this most interesting subject we should fill volumes. We will, therefore, at present, advert to only one important part of the policy of the Church of Rome. She thoroughly understands, what no other Church has ever understood, how to deal with enthusiasts. In some sects, particularly in infant sects, enthusiasm is suffered to be rampant. In other sects, particularly in sects long established and richly endowed, it is regarded with aversion. The Catholic Church neither submits to enthusiasm nor proscribes it, but uses it. She considers it as a great moving force which in itself, like the muscular power of a fine horse, is neither good nor evil, but which may be so directed as to produce great good or great evil; and she assumes the direction to herself. It would be absurd to run down a horse like a wolf. It would be still more absurd to let him run wild, breaking fences, and trampling down passengers. The rational course is to subjugate his will without impairing his vigour, to teach him to obey the rein, and then to urge him to full speed. When once he knows his master, he is valuable in proportion to his strength and spirit. Just such has been the system of the Church of Rome with regard to enthusiasts. She knows that, when religious feelings have obtained the complete empire of the mind, they impart a strange energy, that they raise men above the dominion of pain and pleasure, that obloquy becomes glory, that death itself is contemplated only as the beginning of a higher and happier life. She knows that a person in this state is no object of contempt. He may be vulgar, ignorant, visionary, extravagant; but he will do and suffer things which it is for her interest that somebody should do and suffer, yet from which calm and sober-minded men would shrink. She accordingly enlists him in her service, assigns to him some forlorn hope, in which intrepidity and impetuosity are more wanted than judgment and self-command, and sends him forth with her benedictions and her applause. In England it not unfrequently happens that a tinker or coal- heaver hears a sermon or falls in with a tract which alarms him about the state of his soul. If he be a man of excitable nerves and strong imagination, he thinks himself given over to the Evil Power. He doubts whether he has not committed the unpardonable sin. He imputes every wild fancy that springs up in his mind to the whisper of a fiend. His sleep is broken by dreams of the great judgment-seat, the open books, and the unquenchable fire. If, in order to escape from these vexing thoughts, he flies to amusement or to licentious indulgence, the delusive relief only makes his misery darker and more hopeless. At length a turn takes place. He is reconciled to his offended Maker. To borrow the fine imagery of one who had himself been thus tried, he emerges from the Valley of the Shadow of Death, from the dark land of gins and snares, of quagmires and precipices, of evil spirits and ravenous beasts. The sunshine is on his path. He ascends the Delectable Mountains, and catches from their summit a distant view of the shining city which is the end of his pilgrimage. Then arises in his mind a natural and surely not a censurable desire, to impart to others the thoughts of which his own heart is full, to warn the careless, to comfort those who are troubled in spirit. The impulse which urges him to devote his whole life to the teaching of religion is a strong passion in the guise of a duty. He exhorts his neighbours; and, if he be a man of strong parts, he often does so with great effect. He pleads as if he were pleading for his life, with tears, and pathetic gestures, and burning words; and he soon finds with delight, not perhaps wholly unmixed with the alloy of human infirmity, that his rude eloquence rouses and melts hearers who sleep very composedly while the rector preaches on the apostolical succession. Zeal for God, love for his fellow-creatures, pleasure in the exercise of his newly discovered powers, impel him to become a preacher. He has no quarrel with the establishment, no objection to its formularies, its government, or its vestments. He would gladly be admitted among its humblest ministers, but, admitted or rejected, he feels that his vocation is determined. His orders have come down to him, not through a long and doubtful series of Arian and Popish bishops, but direct from on high. His commission is the same that on the Mountain of Ascension was given to the Eleven. Nor will he, for lack of human credentials, spare to deliver the glorious message with which he is charged by the true Head of the Church. For a man thus minded, there is within the pale of the establishment no place. He has been at no college; he cannot construe a Greek author or write a Latin theme; and he is told that, if he remains in the communion of the Church, he must do so as a hearer, and that, if he is resolved to be a teacher, he must begin by being a schismatic. His choice is soon made. He harangues on Tower Hill or in Smithfield. A congregation is formed. A licence is obtained. A plain brick building, with a desk and benches, is run up, and named Ebenezer or Bethel. In a few weeks the Church has lost for ever a hundred families, not one of which entertained the least scruple about her articles, her liturgy, her government, or her ceremonies. Far different is the policy of Rome. The ignorant enthusiast whom the Anglican Church makes an enemy, and whatever the polite and learned may think, a most dangerous enemy, the Catholic Church makes a champion. She bids him nurse his beard, covers him with a gown and hood of coarse dark stuff, ties a rope round his waist, and sends him forth to teach in her name. He costs her nothing. He takes not a ducat away from the revenues of her beneficed clergy. He lives by the alms of those who respect his spiritual character, and are grateful for his instructions. He preaches, not exactly in the style of Massillon, but in a way which moves the passions of uneducated hearers; and all his influence is employed to strengthen the Church of which he is a minister. To that Church he becomes as strongly attached as any of the cardinals whose scarlet carriages and liveries crowd the entrance of the palace on the Quirinal. In this way the Church of Rome unites in herself all the strength of establishment, and all the strength of dissent. With the utmost pomp of a dominant hierarchy above, she has all the energy of the voluntary system below. It would be easy to mention very recent instances in which the hearts of hundreds of thousands, estranged from her by the selfishness, sloth, and cowardice of the beneficed clergy, have been brought back by the zeal of the begging friars. Even for female agency there is a place in her system. To devout women she assigns spiritual functions, dignities, and magistracies. In our country, if a noble lady is moved by more than ordinary zeal for the propagation of religion, the chance is that, though she may disapprove of no doctrine or ceremony of the Established Church, she will end by giving her name to a new schism. If a pious and benevolent woman enters the cells of a prison to pray with the most unhappy and degraded of her own sex, she does so without any authority from the Church. No line of action is traced out for her; and it is well if the Ordinary does not complain of her intrusion, and if the Bishop does not shake his head at such irregular benevolence. At Rome, the Countess of Huntingdon would have a place in the calendar as St. Selina, and Mrs. Fry would be foundress and first Superior of the Blessed Order of Sisters of the Gaols. Place Ignatius Loyola at Oxford. He is certain to become the head of a formidable secession. Place John Wesley at Rome. He is certain to be the first General of a new society devoted to the interests and honour of the Church. Place St. Theresa in London. Her restless enthusiasm ferments into madness, not untinctured with craft. She becomes the prophetess, the mother of the faithful, holds disputations with the devil, issues sealed pardons to her adorers, and lies in of the Shiloh. Place Joanna Southcote at Rome. She founds an order of barefooted Carmelites, every one of whom is ready to suffer martyrdom for the Church; a solemn service is consecrated to her memory; and her statue, placed over the holy water, strikes the eye of every stranger who enters St. Peter's. We have dwelt long on this subject, because we believe that of the many causes to which the Church of Rome owed her safety and her triumph at the close of the sixteenth century, the chief was the profound policy with which she used the fanaticism of such persons as St. Ignatius and St. Theresa. The Protestant party was now indeed vanquished and humbled. In France, so strong had been the Catholic reaction that Henry the Fourth found it necessary to choose between his religion and his crown. In spite of his clear hereditary right, in spite of his eminent personal qualities, he saw that, unless he reconciled himself to the Church of Rome, he could not count on the fidelity even of those gallant gentlemen whose impetuous valour had turned the tide of battle at Ivry. In Belgium, Poland, and Southern Germany, Catholicism had obtained complete ascendency. The resistance of Bohemia was put down. The Palatinate was conquered. Upper and Lower Saxony were overflowed by Catholic invaders. The King of Denmark stood forth as the Protector of the Reformed Churches: he was defeated, driven out of the empire, and attacked in his own possessions. The armies of the House of Austria pressed on, subjugated Pomerania, and were stopped in their progress only by the ramparts of Stralsund. And now again the tide turned. Two violent outbreaks of religious feeling in opposite directions had given a character to the whole history of a whole century. Protestantism had at first driven back Catholicism to the Alps and the Pyrenees. Catholicism had rallied, and had driven back Protestantism even to the German Ocean. Then the great southern reaction began to slacken, as the great northern movement had slackened before. The zeal of the Catholics waxed cool. Their union was dissolved. The paroxysm of religious excitement was over on both sides. One party had degenerated as far from the spirit of Loyola as the other from the spirit of Luther. During three generations religion had been the mainspring of politics. The revolutions and civil wars of France, Scotland, Holland, Sweden, the long struggle between Philip and Elizabeth, the bloody competition for the Bohemian crown, had all originated in theological disputes. But a great change now took place. The contest which was raging in Germany lost its religious character. It was now, on one side, less a contest for the spiritual ascendency of the Church of Rome than for the temporal ascendency of the House of Austria. On the other side, it was less a contest for the reformed doctrines than for national independence. Governments began to form themselves into new combinations, in which community of political interest was far more regarded than community of religious belief. Even at Rome the progress of the Catholic arms was observed with mixed feelings. The Supreme Pontiff was a sovereign prince of the second rank, and was anxious about the balance of power as well as about the propagation of truth. It was known that he dreaded the rise of an universal monarchy even more than he desired the prosperity of the Universal Church. At length a great event announced to the world that the war of sects had ceased, and that the war of states had succeeded. A coalition, including Calvinists, Lutherans, and Catholics, was formed against the House of Austria. At the head of that coalition were the first statesman and the first warrior of the age; the former a prince of the Catholic Church, distinguished by the vigour and success with which he had put down the Huguenots; the latter a Protestant king who owed his throne to a revolution caused by hatred of Popery. The alliance of Richelieu and Gustavus marks the time at which the great religious struggle terminated. The war which followed was a war for the equilibrium of Europe. When, at length, the peace of Westphalia was concluded, it appeared that the Church of Rome remained in full possession of a vast dominion which in the middle of the preceding century she seemed to be on the point of losing. No part of Europe remained Protestant, except that part which had become thoroughly Protestant before the generation which heard Luther preach had passed away. Since that time there has been no religious war between Catholics and Protestants as such. In the time of Cromwell, Protestant England was united with Catholic France, then governed by a priest, against Catholic Spain. William the Third, the eminently Protestant hero, was at the head of a coalition which included many Catholic powers, and which was secretly favoured even by Rome, against the Catholic Lewis. In the time of Anne, Protestant England and Protestant Holland joined with Catholic Savoy and Catholic Portugal, for the purpose of transferring the crown of Spain from one bigoted Catholic to another. The geographical frontier between the two religions has continued to run almost precisely where it ran at the close of the Thirty Years' War; nor has Protestantism given any proofs of that "expansive power" which has been ascribed to it. But the Protestant boasts, and boasts most justly, that wealth, civilisation, and intelligence, have increased far more on the northern than on the southern side of the boundary, and that countries so little favoured by nature as Scotland and Prussia are now among the most flourishing and best governed portions of the world, while the marble palaces of Genoa are deserted, while banditti infest the beautiful shores of Campania, while the fertile sea-coast of the Pontifical State is abandoned to buffaloes and wild boars. It cannot be doubted that, since the sixteenth century, the Protestant nations have made decidedly greater progress than their neighbours. The progress made by those nations in which Protestantism, though not finally successful, yet maintained a long struggle, and left permanent traces, has generally been considerable. But when we come to the Catholic Land, to the part of Europe in which the first spark of reformation was trodden out as soon as it appeared, and from which proceeded the impulse which drove Protestantism back, we find, at best, a very slow progress, and on the whole a retrogression. Compare Denmark and Portugal. When Luther began to preach, the superiority of the Portuguese was unquestionable. At present, the superiority of the Danes is no less so. Compare Edinburgh and Florence. Edinburgh has owed less to climate, to soil, and to the fostering care of rulers than any capital, Protestant or Catholic. In all these respects, Florence has been singularly happy. Yet whoever knows what Florence and Edinburgh were in the generation preceding the Reformation, and what they are now, will acknowledge that some great cause has, during the last three Centuries, operated to raise one part of the European family, and to depress the other. Compare the history of England and that of Spain during the last century. In arms, arts, sciences, letters, commerce, agriculture, the contrast is most striking. The distinction is not confined to this side of the Atlantic. The colonies planted by England in America have immeasurably outgrown in power those planted by Spain. Yet we have no reason to believe that, at the beginning of the sixteenth century, the Castilian was in any respect inferior to the Englishman. Our firm belief is, that the North owes its great civilisation and prosperity chiefly to the moral effect of the Protestant Reformation, and that the decay of the southern countries of Europe is to be mainly ascribed to the great Catholic revival. About a hundred years after the final settlement of the boundary line between Protestantism and Catholicism, began to appear the signs of the fourth great peril of the Church of Rome. The storm which was now rising against her was of a very different kind from those which had preceded it. Those who had formerly attacked her had questioned only a part of her doctrines. A school was now growing up which rejected the whole. The Albigenses, the Lollards, the Lutherans, the Calvinists, had a positive religious system, and were strongly attached to it. The creed of the new sectaries was altogether negative. They took one of their premises from the Protestants, and one from the Catholics. From the latter they borrowed the principle, that Catholicism was the only pure and genuine Christianity. With the former, they held that some parts of the Catholic system were contrary to reason. The conclusion was obvious. Two propositions, each of which separately is compatible with the most exalted piety, formed, when held in conjunction, the ground-work of a system of irreligion. The doctrine of Bossuet, that transubstantiation is affirmed in the Gospel, and the doctrine of Tillotson, that transubstantiation is an absurdity, when put together, produced by logical necessity, the inferences of Voltaire. Had the sect which was rising at Paris been a sect of mere scoffers, it is very improbable that it would have left deep traces of its existence in the institutions and manners of Europe. Mere negation, mere Epicurean infidelity, as Lord Bacon most justly observes, has never disturbed the peace of the world. It furnishes no motive for action. It inspires no enthusiasm. It has no missionaries, no crusaders, no martyrs. If the Patriarch of the Holy Philosophical Church had contented himself with making jokes about Saul's asses and David's wives, and with criticising the poetry of Ezekiel in the same narrow spirit in which he criticised that of Shakspeare, Rome would have had little to fear. But it is due to him and to his compeers to say that the real secret of their strength lay in the truth which was mingled with their errors, and in the generous enthusiasm which was hidden under their flippancy. They were men who, with all their faults, moral and intellectual, sincerely and earnestly desired the improvement of the condition of the human race, whose blood boiled at the sight of cruelty and injustice, who made manful war, with every faculty which they possessed, on what they considered as abuses, and who on many signal occasions placed themselves gallantly between the powerful and the oppressed. While they assailed Christianity with a rancour and an unfairness disgraceful to men who called themselves philosophers, they yet had, in far greater measure than their opponents, that charity towards men of all classes and races which Christianity enjoins. Religious persecution, judicial torture, arbitrary imprisonment, the unnecessary multiplication of capital punishments, the delay and chicanery of tribunals, the exactions of farmers of the revenue, slavery, the slave trade, were the constant subjects of their lively satire and eloquent disquisitions. When an innocent man was broken on the wheel at Toulouse, when a youth, guilty only of an indiscretion, was beheaded at Abbeville, when a brave officer, borne down by public injustice, was dragged, with a gag in his mouth, to die on the Place de Greve, a voice instantly went forth from the banks of Lake Leman, which made itself heard from Moscow to Cadiz, and which sentenced the unjust judges to the contempt and detestation of all Europe. The really efficient weapons with which the philosophers assailed the evangelical faith were borrowed from the evangelical morality. The ethical and dogmatical parts of the Gospel were unhappily turned against each other. On one side was a Church boasting of the purity of a doctrine derived from the Apostles, but disgraced by the massacre of St. Bartholomew, by the murder of the best of kings, by the war of Cevennes, by the destruction of Port-Royal. On the other side was a sect laughing at the Scriptures, shooting out the tongue at the sacraments, but ready to encounter principalities and powers in the cause of justice, mercy and toleration. Irreligion, accidentally associated with philanthropy, triumphed for a time over religion accidentally associated with political and social abuses. Everything gave way to the zeal and activity of the new reformers. In France, every man distinguished in letters was found in their ranks. Every year gave birth to works in which the fundamental principles of the Church were attacked with argument, invective, and ridicule. The Church made no defence, except by acts of power. Censures were pronounced: books were seized: insults were offered  to the remains of infidel writers; but no Bossuet, no Pascal, came forth to encounter Voltaire. There appeared not a single defence of the Catholic doctrine which produced any considerable effect, or which is now even remembered. A bloody and unsparing persecution, like that which put down the Albigenses, might have put down the philosophers. But the time for De Montforts and Dominics had gone by. The punishments which the priests were still able to inflict were suffficient to irritate, but not sufficient to destroy. The war was between power on one side, and wit on the other; and the power was under far more restraint than the wit. Orthodoxy soon became a synonyme for ignorance and stupidity. It was as necessary to the character of an accomplished man that he should despise the religion of his country, as that he should know his letters. The new doctrines spread rapidly through Christendom. Paris was the capital of the whole Continent. French was everywhere the language of polite circles. The literary glory of Italy and Spain had departed. That of Germany had not dawned. That of England shone, as yet, for the English alone. The teachers of France were the teachers of Europe. The Parisian opinions spread fast among the educated classes beyond the Alps: nor could the vigilance of the Inquisition prevent the contraband importation of the new heresy into Castile and Portugal. Governments, even arbitrary governments, saw with pleasure the progress of this philosophy. Numerous reforms, generally laudable, sometimes hurried on without sufficient regard to time, to place, and to public feeling, showed the extent of its influence. The rulers of Prussia, of Russia, of Austria, and of many smaller states, were supposed to be among the initiated. The Church of Rome was still, in outward show, as stately and splendid as ever; but her foundation was undermined. No state had quitted her communion or confiscated her revenues; but the reverence of the people was everywhere departing from her. The first great warning-stroke was the fall of that society which, in the conflict with Protestantism, had saved the Catholic Church from destruction. The Order of Jesus had never recovered from the injury received in the struggle with Port-Royal. It was now still more rudely assailed by the philosophers. Its spirit was broken; its reputation was tainted. Insulted by all the men of genius in Europe, condemned by the civil magistrate, feebly defended by the chiefs of the hierarchy, it fell: and great was the fall of it. The movement went on with increasing speed. The first generation of the new sect passed away. The doctrines of Voltaire were inherited and exaggerated by successors, who bore to him the same relation which the Anabaptists bore to Luther, or the Fifth- Monarchy men to Pym. At length the Revolution came. Down went the old Church of France, with all its pomp and wealth. Some of its priests purchased a maintenance by separating themselves from Rome, and by becoming the authors of a fresh schism. Some, rejoicing in the new licence, flung away their sacred vestments, proclaimed that their whole life had been an imposture, insulted and persecuted the religion of which they had been ministers, and distinguished themselves, even in the Jacobin Club and the Commune of Paris, by the excess of their impudence and ferocity. Others, more faithful to their principles, were butchered by scores without a trial, drowned, shot, hung on lamp-posts. Thousands fled from their country to take sanctuary under the shade of hostile altars. The churches were closed; the bells were silent; the shrines were plundered; the silver crucifixes were melted down. Buffoons, dressed in copes and surplices, came dancing the carmagnole even to the bar of the Convention. The bust of Marat was substituted for the statues of the martyrs of Christianity. A prostitute, seated on a chair of state in the chancel of Notre Dame, received the adoration of thousands, who exclaimed that at length, for the first time, those ancient Gothic arches had resounded with the accents of truth. The new unbelief was as intolerant as the old superstition. To show reverence for religion was to incur the suspicion of disaffection. It was not without imminent danger that the priest baptized the infant, joined the hands of lovers, or listened to the confession of the dying. The absurd worship of the Goddess of Reason was, indeed, of short duration; but the deism of Robespierre and Lepaux was not less hostile to the Catholic faith than the atheism of Clootz and Chaumette. Nor were the calamities of the Church confined to France. The revolutionary spirit, attacked by all Europe, beat all Europe back, became conqueror in its turn, and, not satisfied with the Belgian cities and the rich domains of the spiritual electors, went raging over the Rhine and through the passes of the Alps. Throughout the whole of the great war against Protestantism, Italy and Spain had been the base of the Catholic operations. Spain was now the obsequious vassal of the infidels. Italy was subjugated by them. To her ancient principalities succeeded the Cisalpine republic, and the Ligurian republic, and the Parthenopean republic. The shrine of Loretto was stripped of the treasures piled up by the devotion of six hundred years. The convents of Rome were pillaged. The tricoloured flag floated on the top of the Castle of St. Angelo. The successor of St. Peter was carried away captive by the unbelievers. He died a prisoner in their hands; and even the honours of sepulture were long withheld from his remains. It is not strange that in the year 1799, even sagacious observers should have thought that, at length, the hour of the Church of Rome was come. An infidel power ascendant, the Pope dying in captivity, the most illustrious prelates of France living in a foreign country on Protestant alms, the noblest edifices which the munificence of former ages had consecrated to the worship of God turned into temples of Victory, or into banqueting-houses for political societies, or into Theophilanthropic chapels, such signs might well be supposed to indicate the approaching end of that long domination. But the end was not yet. Again doomed to death, the milk-white hind was still fated not to die. Even before the funeral rites had been performed over the ashes of Pius the Sixth, a great reaction had commenced, which, after the lapse of more than forty years, appears to be still in progress. Anarchy had had its day. A new order of things rose out of the confusion, new dynasties, new laws, new titles; and amidst them emerged the ancient religion. The Arabs have a fable that the Great Pyramid was built by antediluvian kings, and alone, of all the works of men, bore the weight of the flood. Such as this was the fate of the Papacy. It had been buried under the great inundation; but its deep foundations had remained unshaken; and when the waters abated, it appeared alone amidst the ruins of a world which had passed away. The republic of Holland was gone, and the empire of Germany, and the great Council of Venice, and the old Helvetian League, and the House of Bourbon, and the parliaments and aristocracy of France. Europe was full of young creations, a French empire, a kingdom of Italy, a Confederation of the Rhine. Nor had the late events affected only territorial limits and political institutions. The distribution of property, the composition and spirit of society, had, through great part of Catholic Europe, undergone a complete change. But the unchangeable Church was still there. Some future historian, as able and temperate as Professor Ranke, will, we hope, trace the progress of the Catholic revival of the nineteenth century. We feel that we are drawing too near our own time, and that, if we go on, we shall be in danger of saying much which may be supposed to indicate, and which will certainly excite, angry feelings. We will, therefore, make only one more observation, which, in our opinion, is deserving of serious attention. During the eighteenth century, the influence of the Church of Rome was constantly on the decline. Unbelief made extensive conquests in all the Catholic countries of Europe, and in some countries obtained a complete ascendency. The Papacy was at length brought so low as to be an object of derision to infidels, and of pity rather than of hatred to Protestants. During the nineteenth century, this fallen Church has been gradually rising from her depressed state and reconquering her old dominion. No person who calmly reflects on what, within the last few years, has passed in Spain, in Italy, in South America, in Ireland, in the Netherlands, in Prussia, even in France, can doubt that the power of this Church over the hearts and minds of men, is now greater far than it was when the Encyclopaedia and the Philosophical Dictionary appeared. It is surely remarkable, that neither the moral revolution of the eighteenth century, nor the moral counter-revolution of the nineteenth, should, in any perceptible degree, have added to the domain of Protestantism. During the former period, whatever was lost to Catholicism was lost also to Christianity; during the latter, whatever was regained by Christianity in Catholic countries was regained also by Catholicism. We should naturally have expected that many minds, on the way from superstition to infidelity, or on the way back from infidelity to superstition, would have stopped at an intermediate point. Between the doctrines taught in the schools of the Jesuits, and those which were maintained at the little supper parties of the Baron Holbach, there is a vast interval, in which the human mind, it should seem, might find for itself some resting-place more satisfactory than either of the two extremes. And at the time of the Reformation, millions found such a resting-place. Whole nations then renounced Popery without ceasing to believe in a first cause, in a future life, or in the Divine mission of Jesus. In the last century, on the other hand, when a Catholic renounced his belief in the real Presence, it was a thousand to one that he renounced his belief in the Gospel too; and, when the reaction took place, with belief in the Gospel came back belief in the real presence. We by no means venture to deduce from these phenomena any general law; but we think it a most remarkable fact, that no Christian nation, which did not adopt the principles of the Reformation before the end of the sixteenth century, should ever have adopted them. Catholic communities have, since that time, become infidel and become Catholic again; but none has become Protestant. Here we close this hasty sketch of one of the most important portions of the history of mankind. Our readers will have great reason to feel obliged to us if we have interested them sufficiently to induce them to peruse Professor Ranke's book. We will only caution them against the French translation, a performance which, in our opinion, is just as discreditable to the moral character of the person from whom it proceeds as a false affidavit or a forged bill of exchange would have been, and advise them to study either the original, or the English version, in which the sense and spirit of the original are admirably preserved. WAR OF THE SUCCESSION IN SPAIN (January 1833) History of the War of the Succession in Spain. By LORD MAHON. 8vo. London: 1832. The days when Miscellanies in Prose and Verse by a Person of Honour, and Romances of M. Scuderi, done into English by a Person of Quality, were attractive to readers and profitable to booksellers, have long gone by. The literary privileges once enjoyed by lords are as obsolete as their right to kill the king's deer on their way to Parliament, or as their old remedy of scandalum magnatum. Yet we must acknowledge that, though our political opinions are by no means aristocratical, we always feel kindly disposed towards noble authors. Industry, and a taste for intellectual pleasures, are peculiarly respectable in those who can afford to be idle and who have every temptation to be dissipated. It is impossible not to wish success to a man who, finding himself placed, without any exertion or any merit on his part, above the mass of society, voluntarily descends from his eminence in search of distinctions which he may justly call his own. This is, we think, the second appearance of Lord Mahon in the character of an author. His first book was creditable to him, but was in every respect inferior to the work which now lies before us. He has undoubtedly some of the most valuable qualities of a historian, great diligence in examining authorities, great judgment in weighing testimony, and great impartiality in estimating characters. We are not aware that he has in any instance forgotten the duties belonging to his literary functions in the feelings of a kinsman. He does no more than justice to his ancestor Stanhope; he does full justice to Stanhope's enemies and rivals. His narrative is very perspicuous, and is also entitled to the praise, seldom, we grieve to say, deserved by modern writers, of being very concise. It must be admitted, however, that, with many of the best qualities of a literary veteran, he has some of the faults of a literary novice. He has not yet acquired a great command of words. His style is seldom easy, and is now and then unpleasantly stiff. He is so bigoted a purist that he transforms the Abbe d'Estrees into an Abbot. We do not like to see French words introduced into English composition; but, after all, the first law of writing, that law to which all other laws are subordinate, is this, that the words employed shall be such as convey to the reader the meaning of the writer. Now an Abbot is the head of a religious house; an Abbe is quite a different sort of person. It is better undoubtedly to use an English word than a French word; but it is better to use a French word than to misuse an English word. Lord Mahon is also a little too fond of uttering moral reflections in a style too sententious and oracular. We shall give one instance: "Strange as it seems, experience shows that we usually feel far more animosity against those whom we have injured than against those who injure us: and this remark holds good with every degree of intellect, with every class of fortune, with a prince or a peasant, a stripling or an elder, a hero or a prince." This remark might have seemed strange at the Court of Nimrod or Chedorlaomer; but it has now been for many generations considered as a truism rather than a paradox. Every boy has written on the thesis "Odisse quem loeseris." Scarcely any lines in English poetry are better known than that vigorous couplet, "Forgiveness to the injured does belong; But they ne'er pardon who have done the wrong." The historians and philosophers have quite done with this maxim, and have abandoned it, like other maxims which have lost their gloss, to bad novelists, by whom it will very soon be worn to rags. It is no more than justice to say that the faults of Lord Mahon's book are precisely the faults which time seldom fails to cure, and that the book, in spite of those faults, is a valuable addition to our historical literature. Whoever wishes to be well acquainted with the morbid anatomy of governments, whoever wishes to know how great states may be made feeble and wretched, should study the history of Spain. The empire of Philip the Second was undoubtedly one of the most powerful and splendid that ever existed in the world. In Europe, he ruled Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands on both sides of the Rhine, Franche Comte, Roussillon, the Milanese, and the Two Sicilies. Tuscany, Parma, and the other small states of Italy, were as completely dependent on him as the Nizam and the Rajah of Berar now are on the East India Company. In Asia, the King of Spain was master of the Philippines and of all those rich settlements which the Portuguese had made on the coast of Malabar and Coromandel, in the Peninsula of Malacca, and in the Spice- islands of the Eastern Archipelago. In America his dominions extended on each side of the equator into the temperate zone. There is reason to believe that his annual revenue amounted, in the season of his greatest power, to a sum near ten times as large as that which England yielded to Elizabeth. He had a standing army of fifty thousand excellent troops, at a time when England had not a single battalion in constant pay. His ordinary naval force consisted of a hundred and forty galleys. He held, what no other prince in modern times has held, the dominion both of the land and of the sea. During the greater part of his reign, he was supreme on both elements. His soldiers marched up to the capital of France; his ships menaced the shores of England. It is no exaggeration to say that, during several years, his power over Europe was greater than even that of Napoleon. The influence of the French conqueror never extended beyond low-water mark. The narrowest strait was to his power what it was of old believed that a running stream was to the sorceries of a witch. While his army entered every metropolis from Moscow to Lisbon, the English fleets blockaded every port from Dantzic to Trieste. Sicily, Sardinia, Majorca, Guernsey, enjoyed security through the whole course of a war which endangered every throne on the Continent. The victorious and imperial nation which had filled its museums with the spoils of Antwerp, of Florence, and of Rome, was suffering painfully from the want of luxuries which use had made necessaries. While pillars and arches were rising to commemorate the French conquests, the conquerors were trying to manufacture coffee out of succory and sugar out of beet-root. The influence of Philip on the Continent was as great as that of Napoleon. The Emperor of Germany was his kinsman. France, torn by religious dissensions, was never a formidable opponent, and was sometimes a dependent ally. At the same time, Spain had what Napoleon desired in vain, ships, colonies, and commerce. She long monopolised the trade of America and of the Indian Ocean. All the gold of the West, and all the spices of the East, were received and distributed by her. During many years of war, her commerce was interrupted only by the predatory enterprises of a few roving privateers. Even after the defeat of the Armada, English statesmen continued to look with great dread on the maritime power of Philip. "The King of Spain," said the Lord Keeper to the two Houses in 1593, "since he hath usurped upon the Kingdom of Portugal, hath thereby grown mighty, by gaining the East Indies: so as, how great soever he was before, he is now thereby manifestly more great: . . . He keepeth a navy armed to impeach all trade of merchandise from England to Gascoigne and Guienne which he attempted to do this last vintage; so as he is now become as a frontier enemy to all the west of England, as well as all the south parts, as Sussex, Hampshire, and the Isle of Wight. Yea, by means of his interest in St. Maloes, a port full of shipping for the war, he is a dangerous neighbour to the Queen's isles of Jersey and Guernsey, ancient possessions of this Crown, and never conquered in the greatest wars with France." The ascendency which Spain then had in Europe was, in one sense, well deserved. It was an ascendency which had been gained by unquestioned superiority in all the arts of policy and of war. In the sixteenth century, Italy was not more decidedly the land of the fine arts, Germany was not more decidedly the land of bold theological speculation, than Spain was the land of statesmen and of soldiers. The character which Virgil has ascribed to his countrymen might have been claimed by the grave and haughty chiefs, who surrounded the throne of Ferdinand the Catholic, and of his immediate successors. That majestic art, "regere imperio populos," was not better understood by the Romans in the proudest days of their republic, than by Gonsalvo and Ximenes, Cortes and Alva. The skill of the Spanish diplomatists was renowned throughout Europe. In England the name of Gondomar is still remembered.  The sovereign nation was unrivalled both in regular and irregular warfare. The impetuous chivalry of France, the serried phalanx of Switzerland, were alike found wanting when brought face to face with the Spanish infantry. In the wars of the New World, where something different from ordinary strategy was required in the general and something different from ordinary discipline in the soldier, where it was every day necessary to meet by some new expedient the varying tactics of a barbarous enemy, the Spanish adventurers, sprung from the common people, displayed a fertility of resource, and a talent for negotiation and command, to which history scarcely affords a parallel. The Castilian of those times was to the Italian what the Roman, in the days of the greatness of Rome, was to the Greek. The conqueror had less ingenuity, less taste, less delicacy of perception than the conquered; but far more pride, firmness, and courage, a more solemn demeanour, a stronger sense of honour. The subject had more subtlety in speculation, the ruler more energy in action. The vices of the former were those of a coward; the vices of the latter were those of a tyrant. It may be added, that the Spaniard, like the Roman, did not disdain to study the arts and the language of those whom he oppressed. A revolution took place in the literature of Spain, not unlike that revolution which, as Horace tells us, took place in the poetry of Latium: "Capta ferum victorem cepit." The slave took prisoner the enslaver. The old Castilian ballads gave place to sonnets in the style of Petrarch, and to heroic poems in the stanza of Ariosto, as the national songs of Rome were driven out by imitations of Theocritus, and translations from Menander. In no modern society, not even in England during the reign of Elizabeth, has there been so great a number of men eminent at once in literature and in the pursuits of active life, as Spain produced during the sixteenth century. Almost every distinguished writer was also distinguished as a soldier or a politician. Boscan bore arms with high reputation. Garcilaso de Vega, the author of the sweetest and most graceful pastoral poem of modern times, after a short but splendid military career, fell sword in hand at the head of a storming party. Alonzo de Ercilla bore a conspicuous part in that war of Arauco, which he afterwards celebrated in one of the best heroic poems that Spain has produced. Hurtado de Mendoza, whose poems have been compared to those of Horace, and whose charming little novel is evidently the model of Gil-Blas, has been handed down to us by history as one of the sternest of those iron proconsuls who were employed by the House of Austria to crush the lingering public spirit of Italy. Lope sailed in the Armada; Cervantes was wounded at Lepanto. It is curious to consider with how much awe our ancestors in those times regarded a Spaniard. He was, in their apprehension, a kind of daemon, horribly malevolent, but withal most sagacious and powerful. "They be verye wyse and politicke," says an honest Englishman, in a memorial addressed to Mary, "and can, thorowe ther wysdome, reform and brydell theyr owne natures for a tyme, and applye their conditions to the maners of those men with whom they meddell gladlye by friendshippe; whose mischievous maners a man shall never knowe untyll he come under ther subjection: but then shall he parfectlye parceyve and fele them: which thynge I praye God England never do: for in dissimulations untyll they have ther purposes, and afterwards in oppression and tyrarnnye, when they can obtayne them, they do exceed all other nations upon the earthe." This is just such language as Arminius would have used about the Romans, or as an Indian statesman of our times might use about the English. It is the language of a man burning with hatred, but cowed by those whom he hates; and painfully sensible of their superiority, not only in power, but in intelligence. But how art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer son of the morning! How art thou cut down to the ground, that didst weaken the nations! If we overleap a hundred years, and look at Spain towards the close of the seventeenth century, what a change do we find! The contrast is as great as that which the Rome of Gallienus and Honorius presents to the Rome of Marius and Caesar. Foreign conquest had begun to eat into every part of that gigantic monarchy on which the sun never set. Holland was gone, and Portugal, and Artois, and Roussillon, and Franche Comte. In the East, the empire founded by the Dutch far surpassed in wealth and splendour that which their old tyrants still retained. In the West, England had seized, and still held, settlements in the midst of the Mexican sea. The mere loss of territory was, however, of little moment. The reluctant obedience of distant provinces generally costs more than it is worth. Empires which branch out widely are often more flourishing for a little timely pruning. Adrian acted judiciously when he abandoned the conquests of Trajan; and England was never so rich, so great, so formidable to foreign princes, so absolutely mistress of the sea, as since the loss of her American colonies. The Spanish Empire was still, in outward appearance, great and magnificent. The European dominions subject to the last feeble Prince of the House of Austria were far more extensive than those of Lewis the Fourteenth. The American dependencies of the Castilian Crown still extended far to the North of Cancer and far to the South of Capricorn. But within this immense body there was an incurable decay, an utter want of tone, an utter prostration of strength. An ingenious and diligent population, eminently skilled in arts and manufactures, had been driven into exile by stupid and remorseless bigots. The glory of the Spanish pencil had departed with Velasquez and Murillo. The splendid age of Spanish literature had closed with Solis and Calderon. During the seventeenth century many states had formed great military establishments. But the Spanish army, so formidable under the command of Alva and Farnese, had dwindled away to a few thousand men, ill paid and ill disciplined. England, Holland, and France had great navies. But the Spanish navy was scarcely equal to the tenth part of that mighty force which, in the time of Philip the Second, had been the terror of the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. The arsenals were deserted. The magazines were unprovided. The frontier fortresses were ungarrisoned. The police was utterly inefficient for the protection of the people. Murders were committed in the face of day with perfect impunity. Bravoes and discarded serving-men, with swords at their sides,. swaggered every day through the most public streets and squares of the capital, disturbing the public peace, and setting at defiance the ministers of justice. The finances were in frightful disorder. The people paid much. The Government received little. The American viceroys and the farmers of the revenue became rich, while the merchants broke, while the peasantry starved, while the body-servants of the sovereign remained unpaid, while the soldiers of the royal guard repaired daily to the doors of convents, and battled there with the crowd of beggars for a porringer of broth and a morsel of bread. Every remedy which was tried aggravated the disease. The currency was altered; and this frantic measure produced its never-failing effects. It destroyed all credit, and increased the misery which it was intended to relieve. The American gold, to use the words of Ortiz, was to the necessities of the State but as a drop of water to the lips of a man raging with thirst. Heaps of unopened despatches accumulated in the offices, while the ministers were concerting with bedchamber-women and Jesuits the means of tripping up each other. Every foreign power could plunder and insult with impunity the heir of Charles the Fifth. Into such a state had the mighty kingdom of Spain fallen, while one of its smallest dependencies, a country not so large as the province of Estremadura or Andalusia, situated under an inclement sky, and preserved only by artificial means from the inroads of the ocean, had become a power of the first class, and treated on terms of equality with the Courts of London and Versailles. The manner in which Lord Mahon explains the financial situation of Spain by no means satisfies us. "It will be found," says he, "that those individuals deriving their chief income from mines, whose yearly produce is uncertain and varying, and seems rather to spring from fortune than to follow industry, are usually careless, unthrifty, and irregular in their expenditure. The example of Spain might tempt us to apply the same remark to states." Lord Mahon would find it difficult, we suspect, to make out his analogy. Nothing could be more uncertain and varying than the gains and losses of those who were in the habit of putting into the State lotteries. But no part of the public income was more certain than that which was derived from the lotteries. We believe that this case is very similar to that of the American mines. Some veins of ore exceeded expectation; some fell below it. Some of the private speculators drew blanks, and others gained prizes. But the revenue of the State depended, not on any particular vein, but on the whole annual produce of two great continents. This annual produce seems to have been almost constantly on the increase during the seventeenth century. The Mexican mines were, through the reigns of Philip the Fourth and Charles the Second, in a steady course of improvement; and in South America, though the district of Potosi was not so productive as formerly, other places more than made up for the deficiency. We very much doubt whether Lord Mahon can prove that the income which the Spanish Government derived from the mines of America fluctuated more than the income derived from the internal taxes of Spain itself. All the causes of the decay of Spain resolve themselves into one cause, bad government. The valour, the intelligence, the energy which, at the close of the fifteenth and the beginning of the sixteenth century, had made the Spaniards the first nation in the world, were the fruits of the old institutions of Castile and Arragon, institutions eminently favourable to public liberty. These institutions the first Princes of the House of Austria attacked and almost wholly destroyed. Their successors expiated the crime. The effects of a change from good government to bad government are not fully felt for some time after the change has taken place. The talents and the virtues which a good constitution generates may for a time survive that constitution. Thus the reigns of princes, who have established absolute monarchy on the ruins of popular forms of government often shine in history with a peculiar brilliancy. But when a generation or two has passed away, then comes signally to pass that which was written by Montesquieu, that despotic governments resemble those savages who cut down the tree in order to get at the fruit. During the first years of tyranny, is reaped the harvest sown during the last years of liberty. Thus the Augustan age was rich in great minds formed in the generation of Cicero and Caesar. The fruits of the policy of Augustus were reserved for posterity. Philip the Second was the heir of the Cortes and of the Justiza Mayor; and they left him a nation which seemed able to conquer all the world. What Philip left to his successors is well known. The shock which the great religious schism of the sixteenth century gave to Europe, was scarcely felt in Spain. In England, Germany, Holland, France, Denmark, Switzerland, Sweden, that shock had produced, with some temporary evil, much durable good. The principles of the Reformation had triumphed in some of those countries. The Catholic Church had maintained its ascendency in others. But though the event had not been the same in all, all had been agitated by the conflict. Even in France, in Southern Germany, and in the Catholic cantons of Switzerland, the public mind had been stirred to its inmost depths. The hold of ancient prejudice had been somewhat loosened. The Church of Rome, warned by the danger which she had narrowly escaped, had, in those parts of her dominion, assumed a milder and more liberal character. She sometimes condescended to submit her high pretensions to the scrutiny of reason, and availed herself more sparingly than in former times of the aid of the secular arm. Even when persecution was employed, it was not persecution in the worst and most frightful shape. The severities of Lewis the Fourteenth, odious as they were, cannot be compared with those which, at the first dawn of the Reformation, had been inflicted on the heretics in many parts of Europe. The only effect which the Reformation had produced in Spain had been to make the Inquisition more vigilant and the commonalty more bigoted. The times of refreshing came to all neighbouring countries. One people alone remained, like the fleece of the Hebrew warrior, dry in the midst of that benignant and fertilising dew. While other nations were putting away childish things, the Spaniard still thought as a child and understood as a child. Among the men of the seventeenth century, he was the man of the fifteenth century or of a still darker period, delighted to behold an Auto da fe, and ready to volunteer on a Crusade. The evils produced by a bad government and a bad religion, seemed to have attained their greatest height during the last years of the seventeenth century. While the kingdom was in this deplorable state, the King, Charles, second of the name, was hastening to an early grave. His days had been few and evil. He had been unfortunate in all his wars, in every part of his internal administration, and in all his domestic relations. His first wife, whom he tenderly loved, died very young. His second wife exercised great influence over him, but seems to have been regarded by him rather with fear than with love. He was childless; and his constitution was so completely shattered that, at little more than thirty years of age, he had given up all hopes of posterity. His mind was even more distempered than his body. He was sometimes sunk in listless melancholy, and sometimes harassed by the wildest and most extravagant fancies. He was not, however, wholly destitute of the feelings which became his station. His sufferings were aggravated by the thought that his own dissolution might not improbably be followed by the dissolution of his empire. Several princes laid claim to the succession. The King's eldest sister had married Lewis the Fourteenth. The Dauphin would, therefore, in the common course of inheritance, have succeeded to the crown. But the Infanta had, at the time of her espousals, solemnly renounced, in her own name, and in that of her posterity, all claim to the succession. This renunciation had been confirmed in due form by the Cortes. A younger sister of the King had been the first wife of Leopold, Emperor of Germany. She too had at her marriage renounced her claims to the Spanish crown; but the Cortes had not sanctioned the renunciation, and it was therefore considered as invalid by the Spanish jurists. The fruit of this marriage was a daughter, who had espoused the Elector of Bavaria. The Electoral Prince of Bavaria inherited her claim to the throne of Spain. The Emperor Leopold was son of a daughter of Philip the Third, and was therefore first cousin to Charles. No renunciation whatever had been exacted from his mother at the time of her marriage. The question was certainly very complicated. That claim which, according to the ordinary rules of inheritance, was the strongest, had been barred by a contract executed in the most binding form. The claim of the Electoral Prince of Bavaria was weaker. But so also was the contract which bound him not to prosecute his claim. The only party against whom no instrument of renunciation could be produced was the party who, in respect of blood, had the weakest claim of all. As it was clear that great alarm would be excited throughout Europe if either the Emperor or the Dauphin should become King of Spain, each of those Princes offered to waive his pretensions in favour of his second son, the Emperor, in favour of the Archduke Charles, the Dauphin, in favour of Philip Duke of Anjou. Soon after the peace of Ryswick, William the Third and Lewis the Fourteenth determined to settle the question of the succession without consulting either Charles or the Emperor. France, England, and Holland, became parties to a treaty by which it was stipulated that the Electoral Prince of Bavaria should succeed to Spain, the Indies, and the Netherlands. The Imperial family were to be bought off with the Milanese; and the Dauphin was to have the Two Sicilies. The great object of the King of Spain and of all his counsellors was to avert the dismemberment of the monarchy. In the hope of attaining this end, Charles determined to name a successor. A will was accordingly framed by which the crown was bequeathed to the Bavarian Prince. Unhappily, this will had scarcely been signed when the Prince died. The question was again unsettled, and presented greater difficulties than before. A new Treaty of Partition was concluded between France, England, and Holland. It was agreed that Spain, the Indies, and the Netherlands, should descend to the Archduke Charles. In return for this great concession made by the Bourbons to a rival house, it was agreed that France should have the Milanese, or an equivalent in a more commodious situation, The equivalent in view was the province of Lorraine. Arbuthnot, some years later, ridiculed the Partition Treaty with exquisite humour and ingenuity. Everybody must remember his description of the paroxysm of rage into which poor old Lord Strutt fell, on hearing that his runaway servant Nick Frog, his clothier John Bull, and his old enemy Lewis Baboon, had come with quadrants, poles, and inkhorns, to survey his estate, and to draw his will for him. Lord Mahon speaks of the arrangement with grave severity. He calls it "an iniquitous compact, concluded without the slightest reference to the welfare of the states so readily parcelled and allotted; insulting to the pride of Spain, and tending to strip that country of its hard-won conquests." The most serious part of this charge would apply to half the treaties which have been concluded in Europe quite as strongly as to the Partition Treaty. What regard was shown in the Treaty of the Pyrenees to the welfare of the people of Dunkirk and Roussillon, in the Treaty of Nimeguen to the welfare of the people of Franche Comte, in the Treaty of Utrecht to the welfare of the people of Flanders, in the treaty of 1735 to the welfare of the people of Tuscany? All Europe remembers, and our latest posterity will, we fear, have reason to remember how coolly, at the last great pacification of Christendom, the people of Poland, of Norway, of Belgium, and of Lombardy, were allotted to masters whom they abhorred. The statesmen who negotiated the Partition Treaty were not so far beyond their age and ours in wisdom and virtue as to trouble themselves much about the happiness of the people whom they were apportioning among foreign rulers. But it will be difficult to prove that the stipulations which Lord Mahon condemns were in any respect unfavourable to the happiness of those who were to be transferred to new sovereigns. The Neapolitans would certainly have lost nothing by being given to the Dauphin, or to the Great Turk. Addison, who visited Naples about the time at which the Partition Treaty was signed, has left us a frightful description of the misgovernment under which that part of the Spanish Empire groaned. As to the people of Lorraine, an union with France would have been the happiest event which could have befallen them. Lewis was already their sovereign for all purposes of cruelty and exaction. He had kept their country during many years in his own hands. At the peace of Ryswick, indeed, their Duke had been allowed to return. But the conditions which had been imposed on him made him a mere vassal of France. We cannot admit that the Treaty of Partition was objectionable because it "tended to strip Spain of hard-won conquests." The inheritance was so vast, and the claimants so mighty, that without some dismemberment it was scarcely possible to make a peaceable arrangement. If any dismemberment was to take place, the best way of effecting it surely was to separate from the monarchy those provinces which were at a great distance from Spain, which were not Spanish in manners, in language, or in feelings, which were both worse governed and less valuable than the old kingdoms of Castile and Arragon, and which, having always been governed by foreigners, would not be likely to feel acutely the humiliation of being turned over from one master to another. That England and Holland had a right to interfere is plain. The question of the Spanish succession was not an internal question, but an European question. And this Lord Mahon admits. He thinks that when the evil had been done, and a French prince was reigning at the Escurial, England and Holland were justified in attempting, not merely to strip Spain of its remote dependencies, but to conquer Spain itself; that they were justified in attempting to put, not merely the passive Flemings and Italians, but the reluctant Castilians and Asturians, under the dominion of a stranger. The danger against which the Partition Treaty was intended to guard was precisely the same danger which afterwards was made the ground of war. It will be difficult to prove that a danger which was sufficient to justify the war was insufficient to justify the provisions of the treaty. If, as Lord Mahon contends, it was better that Spain should be subjugated by main force than that she should be governed by a Bourbon, it was surely better that she should be deprived of Sicily and the Milanese than that she should be governed by a Bourbon. Whether the treaty was judiciously framed is quite another question. We disapprove of the stipulations. But we disapprove of them, not because we think them bad, but because we think that there was no chance of their being executed. Lewis was the most faithless of politicians. He hated the Dutch. He hated the Government which the Revolution had established in England. He had every disposition to quarrel with his new allies. It was quite certain that he would not observe his engagements, if it should be for his interest to violate them. Even if it should be for his interest to observe them, it might well be doubted whether the strongest and clearest interest would induce a man so haughty and self-willed to co-operate heartily with two governments which had always been the objects of his scorn and aversion. When intelligence of the second Partition Treaty arrived at Madrid, it roused to momentary energy the languishing ruler of a languishing state. The Spanish ambassador at the Court of London was directed to remonstrate with the Government of William; and his remonstrances were so insolent that he was commanded to leave England. Charles retaliated by dismissing the English and Dutch ambassadors. The French King, though the chief author of the Partition Treaty, succeeded in turning the whole wrath of Charles and of the Spanish people from himself, and in directing it against the two maritime powers. Those powers had now no agent at Madrid. Their perfidious ally was at liberty to carry on his intrigues unchecked; and he fully availed himself of this advantage. A long contest was maintained with varying success by the factions which surrounded the miserable King. On the side of the Imperial family was the Queen, herself a Princess of that family. With her were allied the confessor of the King, and most of the ministers. On the other side were two of the most dexterous politicians of that age, Cardinal Porto Carrero, Archbishop of Toledo, and Harcourt, the ambassador of Lewis. Harcourt was a noble specimen of the French aristocracy in the days of its highest splendour, a finished gentleman, a brave soldier, and a skilful diplomatist. His courteous and insinuating manners, his Parisian vivacity tempered with Castilian gravity, made him the favourite of the whole Court. He became intimate with the grandees. He caressed the clergy. He dazzled the multitude by his magnificent style of living. The prejudices which the people of Madrid had conceived against the French character, the vindictive feelings generated during centuries of national rivalry, gradually yielded to his arts; while the Austrian ambassador, a surly, pompous, niggardly German, made himself and his country more and more unpopular every day. Harcourt won over the Court and the city: Porto Carrero managed the King. Never were knave and dupe better suited to each other. Charles was sick, nervous, and extravagantly superstitious. Porto Carrero had learned in the exercise of his profession the art of exciting and soothing such minds; and he employed that art with the calm and demure cruelty which is the characteristic of wicked and ambitious priests. He first supplanted the confessor. The state of the poor King, during the conflict between his two spiritual advisers, was horrible. At one time he was induced to believe that his malady was the same with that of the wretches described in the New Testament, who dwelt among the tombs, whom no chains could bind, and whom no man dared to approach. At another time a sorceress who lived in the mountains of the Asturias was consulted about his malady. Several persons were accused of having bewitched him. Porto Carrero recommended the appalling rite of exorcism, which was actually performed. The ceremony made the poor King more nervous and miserable than ever. But it served the turn of the Cardinal, who, after much secret trickery, succeeded in casting out, not the devil, but the confessor. The next object was to get rid of the ministers. Madrid was supplied with provisions by a monopoly. The Government looked after this most delicate concern as it looked after everything else. The partisans of the House of Bourbon took advantage of the negligence of the administration. On a sudden the supply of food failed. Exorbitant prices were demanded. The people rose. The royal residence was surrounded by an immense multitude. The Queen harangued them. The priests exhibited the host. All was in vain. It was necessary to awaken the King from his uneasy sleep, and to carry him to the balcony. There a solemn promise was given that the unpopular advisers of the Crown should be forthwith dismissed. The mob left the palace and proceeded to pull down the houses of the ministers. The adherents of the Austrian line were thus driven from power, and the government was intrusted to the creatures of Porto Carrero. The King left the city in which he had suffered so cruel an insult for the magnificent retreat of the Escurial. Here his hypochondriac fancy took a new turn. Like his ancestor Charles the Fifth, he was haunted by the strange curiosity to pry into the secrets of that grave to which he was hastening. In the cemetery which Philip the Second had formed beneath the pavement of the church of St. Lawrence, reposed three generations of Castilian princes. Into these dark vaults the unhappy monarch descended by torchlight, and penetrated to that superb and gloomy chamber where, round the great black crucifix, were ranged the coffins of the kings and queens of Spain. There he commanded his attendants to open the massy chests of bronze in which the relics of his predecessors decayed. He looked on the ghastly spectacle with little emotion till the coffin of his first wife was unclosed, and she appeared before him--such was the skill of the embalmer--in all her well-remembered beauty. He cast one glance on those beloved features, unseen for eighteen years, those features over which corruption seemed to have no power, and rushed from the vault, exclaiming, "She is with God; and I shall soon be with her." The awful sight completed the ruin of his body and mind. The Escurial became hateful to him; and he hastened to Aranjuez. But the shades and waters of that delicious island-garden, so fondly celebrated in the sparkling verse of Calderon, brought no solace to their unfortunate master. Having tried medicine, exercise, and amusement in, vain, he returned to Madrid to die. He was now beset on every side by the bold and skilful agents of the House of Bourbon. The leading politicians of his Court assured him that Lewis, and Lewis alone, was sufficiently powerful to preserve the Spanish monarchy undivided, and that Austria would be utterly unable to prevent the Treaty of Partition from being carried into effect. Some celebrated lawyers gave it as their opinion that the act of renunciation executed by the late Queen of France ought to be construed according to the spirit, and not according to the letter. The letter undoubtedly excluded the French princes. The spirit was merely this, that ample security should be taken against the union of the French and Spanish Crowns on one head. In all probability, neither political nor legal reasonings would have sufficed to overcome the partiality which Charles felt for the House of Austria. There had always been a close connection between the two great royal lines which sprang from the marriage of Philip and Juana. Both had always regarded the French as their natural enemies. It was necessary to have recourse to religious terrors; and Porto Carrero employed those terrors with true professional skill. The King's life was drawing to a close. Would the most Catholic prince commit a great sin on the brink of the grave? And what could be a greater sin than, from an unreasonable attachment to a family name, from an unchristian antipathy to a rival house, to set aside the rightful heir of an immense monarchy? The tender conscience and the feeble intellect of Charles were strongly wrought upon by these appeals. At length Porto Carrero ventured on a master-stroke. He advised Charles to apply for counsel to the Pope. The King, who, in the simplicity of his heart, considered the successor of St. Peter as an infallible guide in spiritual matters, adopted the suggestion; and Porto Carrero, who knew that his Holiness was a mere tool of France, awaited with perfect confidence the result of the application. In the answer which arrived from Rome, the King was solemnly reminded of the great account which he was soon to render, and cautioned against the flagrant injustice which he was tempted to commit. He was assured that the right was with the House of Bourbon, and reminded that his own salvation ought to be dearer to him than the House of Austria. Yet he still continued irresolute. His attachment to his family, his aversion to France, were not to be overcome even by Papal authority. At length he thought himself actually dying. Then the cardinal redoubled his efforts. Divine after divine, well tutored for the occasion, was brought to the bed of the trembling penitent. He was dying in the commission of known sin. He was defrauding his relatives. He was bequeathing civil war to his people. He yielded, and signed that memorable testament, the cause of many calamities to Europe. As he affixed his name to the instrument, he burst into tears. "God," he said, "gives kingdoms and takes them away. I am already one of the dead." The will was kept secret during the short remainder of his life. On the third of November 1700 he expired. All Madrid crowded to the palace. The gates were thronged. The antechamber was filled with ambassadors and grandees, eager to learn what dispositions the deceased sovereign had made. At length the folding doors were flung open. The Duke of Abrantes came forth, and announced that the whole Spanish monarchy was bequeathed to Philip, Duke of Anjou. Charles had directed that, during the interval which might elapse between his death and the arrival of his successor, the government should be administered by a council, of which Porto Carrero was the chief member. Lewis acted, as the English ministers might have guessed that he would act. With scarcely the show of hesitation, he broke through all the obligations of the Partition Treaty, and accepted for his grandson the splendid legacy of Charles. The new sovereign hastened to take possession of his dominions. The whole Court of France accompanied him to Sceaux. His brothers escorted him to that frontier which, as they weakly imagined, was to be a frontier no longer. "The Pyrenees," said Lewis, "have ceased to exist." Those very Pyrenees, a few years later, were the theatre of a war between the heir of Lewis and the prince whom France was now sending to govern Spain. If Charles had ransacked Europe to find a successor whose moral and intellectual character resembled his own, he could not have chosen better. Philip was not so sickly as his predecessor, but he was quite as weak, as indolent, and as superstitious; he very soon became quite as hypochondriacal and eccentric; and he was even more uxorious. He was indeed a husband of ten thousand. His first object, when he became King of Spain, was to procure a wife. From the day of his marriage to the day of her death, his first object was to have her near him, and to do what she wished. As soon as his wife died, his first object was to procure another. Another was found, as unlike the former as possible. But she was a wife; and Philip was content. Neither by day nor by night, neither in sickness nor in health, neither in time of business nor in time of relaxation, did he ever suffer her to be absent from him for half an hour. His mind was naturally feeble; and he had received an enfeebling education. He had been brought up amidst the dull magnificence of Versailles. His grandfather was as imperious and as ostentatious in his intercourse with the royal family as in public acts. All those who grew up immediately under the eye of Lewis had the manners of persons who had never known what it was to be at ease. They were all taciturn, shy, and awkward. In all of them, except the Duke of Burgundy, the evil went further than the manners. The Dauphin, the Duke Of Berri, Philip of Anjou, were men of insignificant characters. They had no energy, no force of will. They had been so little accustomed to judge or to act for themselves that implicit dependence had become necessary to their comfort. The new King of Spain, emancipated from control, resembled that wretched German captive who, when the irons which he had worn for years were knocked off, fell prostrate on the floor of his prison. The restraints which had enfeebled the mind of the young Prince were required to support it. Till he had a wife he could do nothing; and when he had a wife he did whatever she chose. While this lounging, moping boy was on his way to Madrid, his grandfather was all activity. Lewis had no reason to fear a contest with the Empire single-handed. He made vigorous preparations to encounter Leopold. He overawed the States-General by means of a great army. He attempted to soothe the English Government by fair professions. William was not deceived. He fully returned the hatred of Lewis; and, if he had been free to act according to his own inclinations, he would have declared war as soon as the contents of the will were known. But he was bound by constitutional restraints. Both his person and his measures were unpopular in England. His secluded life and his cold manners disgusted a people accustomed to the graceful affability of Charles the Second. His foreign accent and his foreign attachments were offensive to the national prejudices. His reign had been a season of distress, following a season of rapidly increasing prosperity. The burdens of the late war and the expense of restoring the currency had been severely felt. Nine clergymen out of ten were Jacobites at heart, and had sworn allegiance to the new dynasty, only in order to save their benefices. A large proportion of the country gentlemen belonged to the same party. The whole body of agricultural proprietors was hostile to that interest which the creation of the national debt had brought into notice, and which was believed to be peculiarly favoured by the Court, the monied interest. The middle classes were fully determined to keep out James and his family. But they regarded William only as the less of two evils; and, as long as there was no imminent danger of a counter-revolution, were disposed to thwart and mortify the sovereign by whom they were, nevertheless, ready to stand, in case of necessity, with their lives and fortunes. They were sullen and dissatisfied. "There was," as Somers expressed it in a remarkable letter to William, "a deadness and want of spirit in the nation universally." Everything in England was going on as Lewis could have wished. The leaders of the Whig party had retired from power, and were extremely unpopular on account of the unfortunate issue of the Partition Treaty. The Tories, some of whom still cast a lingering look towards St. Germains, were in office, and had a decided majority in the House of Commons. William was so much embarrassed by the state of parties in England that he could not venture to make war on the House of Bourbon. He was suffering under a complication of severe and incurable diseases. There was every reason to believe that a few months would dissolve the fragile tie which bound up that feeble body with that ardent and unconquerable soul. If Lewis could succeed in preserving peace for a short time, it was probable that all his vast designs would be securely accomplished. Just at this crisis, the most important crisis of his life, his pride and his passions hurried him into an error, which undid all that forty years of victory and intrigue had done, which produced the dismemberment of the kingdom of his grandson, and brought invasion, bankruptcy, and famine on his own. James the Second died at St. Germains. Lewis paid him a farewell visit, and was so much moved by the solemn parting, and by the grief of the exiled queen, that, losing sight of all considerations of policy, and actuated, as it should seem, merely by compassion and by a not ungenerous vanity, he acknowledged the Prince of Wales as King of England. The indignation which the Castilians had felt when they heard that three foreign powers had undertaken to regulate the Spanish succession was nothing to the rage with which the English learned that their good neighbour had taken the trouble to provide them with a king. Whigs and Tories joined in condemning the proceedings of the French Court. The cry for war was raised by the city of London, and echoed and re-echoed from every corner of the realm. William saw that his time was come. Though his wasted and suffering body could hardly move without support, his spirit was as energetic and resolute as when, at twenty-three, he bade defiance to the combined forces of England and France. He left the Hague, where he had been engaged in negotiating with the States and the Emperor a defensive treaty against the ambitious designs of the Bourbons. He flew to London. He remodelled the Ministry. He dissolved the Parliament. The majority of the new House of Commons was with the King; and the most vigorous preparations were made for war. Before the commencement of active hostilities William was no more. But the Grand Alliance of the European Princes against the Bourbons was already constructed. "The master workman died," says Mr. Burke; "but the work was formed on true mechanical principles, and it was as truly wrought." On the fifteenth of May, 1702, war was proclaimed by concert at Vienna, at London, and at the Hague. Thus commenced that great struggle by which Europe, from the Vistula to the Atlantic Ocean, was agitated during twelve years. The two hostile coalitions were, in respect of territory, wealth, and population, not unequally matched. On the one side were France, Spain, and Bavaria; on the other, England, Holland, the Empire, and a crowd of inferior Powers. That part of the war which Lord Mahon has undertaken to relate, though not the least important, is certainly the least attractive. In Italy, in Germany, and in the Netherlands, great means were at the disposal of great generals. Mighty battles were fought. Fortress after fortress was subdued. The iron chain of the Belgian strongholds was broken. By a regular and connected series of operations extending through several years, the French were driven back from the Danube and the Po into their own provinces. The war in Spain, on the contrary, is made up of events which seem to have no dependence on each other. The turns of fortune resemble those which take place in a dream. Victory and defeat are not followed by their usual consequences. Armies spring out of nothing, and melt into nothing. Yet, to judicious readers of history, the Spanish conflict is perhaps more interesting than the campaigns of Marlborough and Eugene. The fate of the Milanese and of the Low Countries was decided by military skill. The fate of Spain was decided by the peculiarities of the national character. When the war commenced, the young King was in a most deplorable situation. On his arrival at Madrid, he found Porto Carrero at the head of affairs, and he did not think fit to displace the man to whom he owed his crown. The Cardinal was a mere intriguer, and in no sense a statesman. He had acquired, in the Court and in the confessional, a rare degree of skill in all the tricks by which. weak minds are managed. But of the noble science of government, of the sources of national prosperity, of the causes of national decay, he knew no more than his master. It is curious to observe the contrast between the dexterity with which he ruled the conscience of a foolish valetudinarian, and the imbecility which he showed when placed at the head of an empire. On what grounds Lord Mahon represents the Cardinal as a man "of splendid genius," "of vast abilities," we are unable to discover. Lewis was of a very different opinion, and Lewis was very seldom mistaken in his judgment of character. "Everybody," says he, in a letter to his ambassador, "knows how incapable the Cardinal is. He is an object of contempt to his countrymen." A few miserable savings were made, which ruined individuals without producing any perceptible benefit to the State. The police became more and more inefficient. The disorders of the capital were increased by the arrival of French adventurers, the refuse of Parisian brothels and gaming-houses. These wretches considered the Spaniards as a subjugated race whom the countrymen of the new sovereign might cheat and insult with impunity. The King sate eating and drinking all night, lay in bed all day, yawned at the council table, and suffered the most important papers to lie unopened for weeks. At length he was roused by the only excitement of which his sluggish nature was susceptible. His grandfather consented to let him have a wife. The choice was fortunate. Maria Louisa, Princess of Savoy, a beautiful and graceful girl of thirteen, already a woman in person and mind at an age when the females of colder climates are still children, was the person selected. The King resolved to give her the meeting in Catalonia. He left his capital, of which he was already thoroughly tired. At setting out he was mobbed by a gang of beggars. He, however, made his way through them, and repaired to Barcelona. Lewis was perfectly aware that the Queen would govern Philip. He, accordingly, looked about for somebody to govern the Queen. He selected the Princess Orsini to be first lady of the bedchamber, no insignificant post in the household of a very young wife, and a very uxorious husband. The Princess was the daughter of a French peer, and the widow of a Spanish grandee. She was, therefore, admirably fitted by her position to be the instrument of the Court of Versailles at the Court of Madrid. The Duke of Orleans called her, in words too coarse for translation, the Lieutenant of Captain Maintenon: and the appellation was well deserved. She aspired to play in Spain the part which Madame de Maintenon had played in France. But, though at least equal to her model in wit, information, and talents for intrigue, she had not that self-command, that patience, that imperturbable evenness of temper, which had raised the widow of a buffoon to be the consort of the proudest of kings. The Princess was more than fifty years old, but was still vain of her fine eyes, and her fine shape; she still dressed in the style of a girl; and she still carried her flirtations so far as to give occasion for scandal. She was, however, polite, eloquent, and not deficient in strength of mind. The bitter Saint Simon owns that no person whom she wished to attach could long resist the graces of her manners and of her conversation. We have not time to relate how she obtained, and how she preserved, her empire over the young couple in whose household she was placed, how she became so powerful, that neither minister of Spain nor ambassador from France could stand against her, how Lewis himself was compelled to court her, how she received orders from Versailles to retire, how the Queen took part with her favourite attendant, how the King took part with the Queen, and how, after much squabbling, lying, shuffling, bullying, and coaxing, the dispute was adjusted. We turn to the events of the war. When hostilities were proclaimed at London, Vienna, and the Hague, Philip was at Naples. He had been with great difficulty prevailed upon, by the most urgent representations from Versailles, to separate himself from his wife, and to repair without her to his Italian dominions, which were then menaced by the Emperor. The Queen acted as Regent, and, child as she was, seems to have been quite as competent to govern the kingdom as her husband or any of his ministers. In August 1702, an armament, under the command of the Duke of Ormond, appeared off Cadiz. The Spanish authorities had no funds and no regular troops. The national spirit, however, supplied, in some degree, what was wanting. The nobles and farmers advanced money. The peasantry were formed into what the Spanish writers call bands of heroic patriots, and what General Stanhope calls "a rascally foot militia." If the invaders had acted with vigour and judgment, Cadiz would probably have fallen. But the chiefs of the expedition were divided by national and professional feelings, Dutch against English, and land against sea. Sparre, the Dutch general, was sulky and perverse. Bellasys, the English general, embezzled the stores. Lord Mahon imputes the ill-temper of Sparre to the influence of the republican institutions of Holland. By parity of reason, we suppose that he would impute the peculations of Bellasys to the influence of the monarchical and aristocratical institutions of England. The Duke of Ormond, who had the command of the whole expedition, proved on this occasion, as on every other, destitute of the qualities which great emergencies require. No discipline was kept; the soldiers were suffered to rob and insult those whom it was most desirable to conciliate. Churches were robbed, images were pulled down; nuns were violated. The officers shared the spoil instead of punishing the spoilers; and at last the armament, loaded, to use the words of Stanhope, "with a great deal of plunder and infamy," quitted the scene of Essex's glory, leaving the only Spaniard of note who had declared for them to be hanged by his countrymen. The fleet was off the coast of Portugal, on the way back to England, when the Duke of Ormond received intelligence that the treasure-ships from America had just arrived in Europe, and had, in order to avoid his armament, repaired to the harbour of Vigo. The cargo consisted, it was said, of more than three millions sterling in gold and silver, besides much valuable merchandise. The prospect of plunder reconciled all disputes. Dutch and English admirals and generals, were equally eager for action. The Spaniards might with the greatest ease have secured the treasure by simply landing it; but it was a fundamental law of Spanish trade that the galleons should unload at Cadiz, and at Cadiz only. The Chamber of Commerce at Cadiz, in the true spirit of monopoly, refused, even at this conjuncture, to bate one jot of its privilege. The matter was referred to the Council of the Indies. That body deliberated and hesitated just a day too long. Some feeble preparations for defence were made. Two ruined towers at the mouth of the bay of Vigo were garrisoned by a few ill-armed and untrained rustics; a boom was thrown across the entrance of the basin; and a few French ships of war, which had convoyed the galleons from America, were moored within. But all was to no purpose. The English ships broke the boom; Ormond and his soldiers scaled the forts; the French burned their ships, and escaped to the shore. The conquerors shared some millions of dollars; some millions more were sunk. When all the galleons had been captured or destroyed came an order in due form allowing them to unload. When Philip returned to Madrid in the beginning of 1703, he found the finances more embarrassed, the people more discontented and the hostile coalition more formidable than ever. The loss of the galleons had occasioned a great deficiency in the revenue. The Admiral of Castile, one of the greatest subjects in Europe, had fled to Lisbon and sworn allegiance to the Archduke. The King of Portugal soon after acknowledged Charles as King of Spain, and prepared to support the title of the House of Austria by arms. On the other side, Lewis sent to the assistance of his grandson an army of 12,000 men, commanded by the Duke of Berwick. Berwick was the son of James the Second and Arabella Churchill. He had been brought up to expect the highest honours which an English subject could enjoy; but the whole course of his life was changed by the revolution which overthrew his infatuated father. Berwick became an exile, a man without a country; and from that time forward his camp was to him in the place of a country, and professional honour was his patriotism. He ennobled his wretched calling. There was a stern, cold, Brutus-like virtue in the manner in which he discharged the duties of a soldier of fortune. His military fidelity was tried by the strongest temptations, and was found invincible. At one time he fought against his uncle; at another time he fought against the cause of his brother; yet he was never suspected of treachery or even of slackness. Early in 1704 an army, composed of English, Dutch, and Portuguese, was assembled on the western frontier of Spain. The Archduke Charles had arrived at Lisbon, and appeared in person at the head of his troops. The military skill of Berwick held the Allies, who were commanded by Lord Galway, in check through the whole campaign. On the south, however, a great blow was struck. An English fleet, under Sir George Rooke, having on board several regiments commanded by the Prince of Hesse Darmstadt, appeared before the rock of Gibraltar. That celebrated stronghold, which nature has made all but impregnable, and against which all the resources of the military art have been employed in vain, was taken as easily as if it had been an open village in a plain. The garrison went to say their prayers instead of standing on their guard. A few English sailors climbed the rock. The Spaniards capitulated; and the British flag was placed on those ramparts from which the combined armies and navies of France and Spain have never been able to pull it down. Rooke proceeded to Malaga, gave battle in the neighbourhood of that port to a French squadron, and after a doubtful action returned to England. But greater events were at hand. The English Government had determined to send an expedition to Spain, under the command of Charles Mordaunt, Earl of Peterborough. This man was, if not the greatest, yet assuredly the most extraordinary character of that age, the King of Sweden himself not excepted. Indeed, Peterborough may be described as a polite, learned, and amorous Charles the Twelfth. His courage had all the French impetuosity, and all the English steadiness. His fertility and activity of mind were almost beyond belief. They appeared in everything that he did, in his campaigns, in his negotiations, in his familiar correspondence, in his lightest and most unstudied conversation. He was a kind friend, a generous enemy, and in deportment a thorough gentleman. But his splendid talents and virtues were rendered almost useless to his country, by his levity, his restlessness, his irritability, his morbid craving for novelty and for excitement. His weaknesses had not only brought him, on more than one occasion, into serious trouble; but had impelled him to some actions altogether unworthy of his humane and noble nature. Repose was insupportable to him. He loved to fly round Europe faster than a travelling courier. He was at the Hague one week, at Vienna the next. Then he took a fancy to see Madrid; and he had scarcely reached Madrid, when he ordered horses and set off for Copenhagen. No attendants could keep up with his speed. No bodily infirmities could confine him. Old age, disease, imminent death, produced scarcely any effect on his intrepid spirit. Just before he underwent the most horrible of surgical operations, his conversation was as sprightly as that of a young man in the full vigour of health. On the day after the operation, in spite of the entreaties of his medical advisers, he would set out on a journey. His figure was that of a skeleton. But his elastic mind supported him under fatigues and sufferings which seemed sufficient to bring the most robust man to the grave. Change of employment was as necessary to him as change of place. He loved to dictate six or seven letters at once. Those who had to transact business with him complained that though he talked with great ability on every subject, he could never be kept to the point. "Lord Peterborough," said Pope, "would say very pretty and lively things in his letters, but they would be rather too gay and wandering; whereas, were Lord Bolingbroke to write to an emperor, or to a statesman, he would fix on that point which was the most material, would set it in the strongest and fiercest light, and manage it so as to make it the most serviceable to his purpose." What Peterborough was to Bolingbroke as a writer, he was to Marlborough as a general. He was, in truth, the last of the knights-errant, brave to temerity, liberal to profusion, courteous in his dealings with enemies, the Protector of the oppressed, the adorer of women. His virtues and vices were those of the Round Table. Indeed, his character can hardly be better summed up, than in the lines in which the author of that clever little poem, Monks and Giants, has described Sir Tristram. "His birth, it seems, by Merlin's calculation, Was under Venus, Mercury, and Mars; His mind with all their attributes was mixed, And, like those planets, wandering and unfixed. "From realm to realm he ran, and never staid: Kingdoms and crowns he won, and gave away: It seemed as if his labours were repaid By the mere noise and movement of the fray: No conquests or acquirements had he made; His chief delight was, on some festive day To ride triumphant, prodigal, and proud, And shower his wealth amidst the shouting crowd. "His schemes of war were sudden, unforeseen, Inexplicable both to friend and foe; It seemed as if some momentary spleen Inspired the project, and impelled the blow; And most his fortune and success were seen With means the most inadequate and low; Most master of himself, and least encumbered, When overmatched, entangled, and outnumbered." In June 1705, this remarkable man arrived in Lisbon with five thousand Dutch and English soldiers. There the Archduke embarked with a large train of attendants, whom Peterborough entertained magnificently during the voyage at his own expense. From Lisbon the armament proceeded to Gibraltar, and, having taken the Prince of Hesse Darmstadt on board, steered towards the north-east along the coast of Spain. The first place at which the expedition touched, after leaving Gibraltar, was Altea in Valencia. The wretched misgovernment of Philip had excited great discontent throughout this province. The invaders were eagerly welcomed. The peasantry flocked to the shore, bearing provisions, and shouting, "Long live Charles the Third." The neighbouring fortress of Denia surrendered without a blow. The imagination of Peterborough took fire. He conceived the hope of finishing the war at one blow. Madrid was but a hundred and fifty miles distant. There was scarcely one fortified place on the road. The troops of Philip were either on the frontiers of Portugal or on the coast of Catalonia. At the capital there was no military force, except a few horse who formed a guard of honour round the person of Philip. But the scheme of pushing into the heart of a great kingdom with an army of only seven thousand men, was too daring to please the Archduke. The Prince of Hesse Darmstadt, who, in the reign of the late King of Spain, had been Governor of Catalonia, and who overrated his own influence in that province, was of opinion that they ought instantly to proceed thither, and to attack Barcelona, Peterborough was hampered by his instructions, and found it necessary to submit. On the sixteenth of August the fleet arrived before Barcelona; and Peterborough found that the task assigned to him by the Archduke and the Prince was one of almost insuperable difficulty. One side of the city was protected by the sea; the other by the strong fortifications of Monjuich. The walls were so extensive, that thirty thousand men would scarcely have been sufficient to invest them. The garrison was as numerous as the besieging army. The best officers in the Spanish service were in the town. The hopes which the Prince of Darmstadt had formed of a general rising in Catalonia were grievously disappointed. The invaders were joined only by about fifteen hundred armed peasants, whose services cost more than they were worth. No general was ever in a more deplorable situation than that in which Peterborough was now placed. He had always objected to the scheme of besieging Barcelona. His objections had been overruled. He had to execute a project which he had constantly represented as impracticable. His camp was divided into hostile factions and he was censured by all. The Archduke and the Prince blamed him for not proceeding instantly to take the town; but suggested no plan by which seven thousand men could be enabled to do the work of thirty thousand. Others blamed their general for giving up his own opinion to the childish whims of Charles, and for sacrificing his men in an attempt to perform what was impossible. The Dutch commander positively declared that his soldiers should not stir: Lord Peterborough might give what orders he chose; but to engage in such a siege was madness; and the men should not be sent to certain death when there was no chance of obtaining any advantage. At length, after three weeks of inaction, Peterborough announced his fixed determination to raise the siege. The heavy cannon were sent on board. Preparations were made for re-embarking the troops. Charles and the Prince of Hesse were furious, but most of the officers blamed their general for having delayed so long the measure which he had at last found it necessary to take. On the twelfth of September there were rejoicings and public entertainments in Barcelona for this great deliverance. On the following morning the English flag was flying on the ramparts of Monjuich. The genius and energy of one man had supplied the place of forty battalions. At midnight Peterborough had called out the Prince of Hesse, with whom he had not for some time been on speaking terms, "I have resolved, sir," said the Earl, "to attempt an assault; you may accompany us, if you think fit, and see whether I and my men deserve what you have been pleased to say of us." The Prince was startled. The attempt, he said, was hopeless; but he was ready to take his share; and, without further discussion, he called for his horse. Fifteen hundred English soldiers were assembled under the Earl. A thousand more had been posted as a body of reserve, at a neighbouring convent, under the command of Stanhope. After a winding march along the foot of the hills, Peterborough and his little army reached the walls of Monjuich. There they halted till daybreak. As soon as they were descried, the enemy advanced into the outer ditch to meet them. This was the event on which Peterborough had reckoned, and for which his men were prepared. The English received the fire, rushed forward, leaped into the ditch, put the Spaniards to flight, and entered the works together with the fugitives. Before the garrison had recovered from their first surprise, the Earl was master of the outworks, had taken several pieces of cannon, and had thrown up a breastwork to defend his men. He then sent off for Stanhope's reserve. While he was waiting for this reinforcement, news arrived that three thousand men were marching from Barcelona towards Monjuich. He instantly rode out to take a view of them; but no sooner had he left his troops than they were seized with a panic. Their situation was indeed full of danger; they had been brought into Monjuich, they scarcely knew how; their numbers were small; their general was gone: their hearts failed them, and they were proceeding to evacuate the fort. Peterborough received information of these occurrences in time to stop the retreat. He galloped up to the fugitives, addressed a few words to them, and put himself at their head. The sound of his voice and the sight of his face restored all their courage, and they marched back to their former position. The Prince of Hesse had fallen in the confusion of the assault; but everything else went well. Stanhope arrived; the detachment which had marched out of Barcelona retreated; the heavy cannon were disembarked, and brought to bear on the inner fortifications of Monjuich, which speedily fell. Peterborough, with his usual generosity, rescued the Spanish soldiers from the ferocity of his victorious army, and paid the last honours with great pomp to his rival the Prince of Hesse. The reduction of Monjuich was the first of a series of brilliant exploits. Barcelona fell; and Peterborough had the glory of taking, with a handful of men, one of the largest and strongest towns of Europe. He had also the glory, not less dear to his chivalrous temper, of saving the life and honour of the beautiful Duchess of Popoli, whom he met flying with dishevelled hair from the fury of the soldiers. He availed himself dexterously of the jealousy with which the Catalonians regarded the inhabitants of Castile. He guaranteed to the province in the capital of which he was now quartered all its ancient rights and liberties, and thus succeeded in attaching the population to the Austrian cause. The open country now declared in favour of Charles. Tarragona, Tortosa, Gerona, Lerida, San Mateo, threw open their gates. The Spanish Government sent the Count of Las Torres with seven thousand men to reduce San Mateo. The Earl of Peterborough, with only twelve hundred men, raised the siege. His officers advised him to be content with this extraordinary success. Charles urged him to return to Barcelona; but no remonstrances could stop such a spirit in the midst of such a career. It was the depth of winter. The country was mountainous. The roads were almost impassable. The men were ill-clothed. The horses were knocked up. The retreating army was far more numerous than the pursuing army. But difficulties and dangers vanished before the energy of Peterborough. He pushed on, driving Las Torres before him. Nules surrendered to the mere terror of his name; and, on the fourth of February, 1706 he arrived in triumph at Valencia. There he learned that a body of four thousand men was on the march to join Las Torres. He set out at dead of night from Valencia, passed the Xucar, came unexpectedly on the encampment of the enemy, and slaughtered, dispersed, or took the whole reinforcement. The Valencians could scarcely believe their eyes when they saw the prisoners brought in. In the meantime the Courts of Madrid and Versailles, exasperated and alarmed by the fall of Barcelona and by the revolt of the surrounding country, determined to make a great effort. A large army, nominally commanded by Philip, but really under the orders of Marshal Tesse, entered Catalonia. A fleet under the Count of Toulouse, one of the natural children of Lewis the Fourteenth, appeared before the port of Barcelona, The city was attacked at once by sea and land. The person of the Archduke was in considerable danger. Peterborough, at the head of about three thousand men, marched with great rapidity from Valencia. To give battle, with so small a force, to a great regular army under the conduct of a Marshal of France, would have been madness. The Earl therefore made war after the fashion of the Minas and Empecinados of our own time. He took his post on the neighbouring mountains, harassed the enemy with incessant alarms, cut off their stragglers, intercepted their communications with the interior, and introduced supplies, both of men and provisions, into the town. He saw, however, that the only hope of the besieged was on the side of the sea. His commission from the British Government gave him supreme power, not only over the army, but, whenever he should be actually on board, over the navy also. He put out to sea at night in an open boat, without communicating his design to any person. He was picked up several leagues from the shore, by one of the ships of the English squadron. As soon as he was on board, he announced himself as first in command, and sent a pinnace with his orders to the Admiral. Had these orders been given a few hours earlier, it is probable that the whole French fleet would have been taken. As it was, the Count of Toulouse put out to sea. The port was open. The town was relieved. On the following night the enemy raised the siege and retreated to Roussillon. Peterborough returned to Valencia, a place which he preferred to every other in Spain; and Philip, who had been some weeks absent from his wife, could endure the misery of separation no longer, and flew to rejoin her at Madrid. At Madrid, however, it was impossible for him or for her to remain. The splendid success which Peterborough had obtained on the eastern coast of the Peninsula had inspired the sluggish Galway with emulation. He advanced into the heart of Spain. Berwick retreated. Alcantara, Ciudad Rodrigo, and Salamanca fell, and the conquerors marched towards the capital. Philip was earnestly pressed by his advisers to remove the seat of government to Burgos. The advance guard of the allied army was already seen on the heights above Madrid. It was known that the main body was at hand. The unfortunate Prince fled with his Queen and his household. The royal wanderers, after travelling eight days on bad roads, under a burning sun, and sleeping eight nights in miserable hovels, one of which fell down and nearly crushed them both to death, reached the metropolis of Old Castile. In the meantime the invaders had entered Madrid in triumph, and had proclaimed the Archduke in the streets of the imperial city. Arragon, ever jealous of the Castilian ascendency, followed the example of Catalonia. Saragossa revolted without seeing an enemy. The governor whom Philip had set over Carthagena betrayed his trust, and surrendered to the Allies the best arsenal and the last ships which Spain possessed. Toledo had been for some time the retreat of two ambitious, turbulent and vindicative intriguers, the Queen Dowager and Cardinal Porto Carrero. They had long been deadly enemies. They had led the adverse factions of Austria and France. Each had in turn domineered over the weak and disordered mind of the late King. At length the impostures of the priest had triumphed over the blandishments of the woman; Porto Carrero had remained victorious; and the Queen had fled in shame and mortification, from the Court where she had once been supreme. In her retirement she was soon joined by him whose arts had destroyed her influence. The Cardinal, having held power just long enough to convince all parties of his incompetency, had been dismissed to his See, cursing his own folly and the ingratitude of the House which he had served too well. Common interests and common enmities reconciled the fallen rivals. The Austrian troops were admitted into Toledo without opposition. The Queen Dowager flung off that mournful garb which the widow of a King of Spain wears through her whole life, and blazed forth in jewels. The Cardinal blessed the standards of the invaders in his magnificent cathedral, and lighted up his palace in honour of the great deliverance. It seemed that the struggle had terminated in favour of the Archduke, and that nothing remained for Philip but a prompt flight into the dominions of his grandfather. So judged those who were ignorant of the character and habits of the Spanish people. There is no country in Europe which it is so easy to overrun as Spain, there is no country in Europe which it is more difficult to conquer. Nothing can be more contemptible than the regular military resistance which Spain offers to an invader; nothing more formidable than the energy which she puts forth when her regular military resistance has been beaten down. Her armies have long borne too much resemblance to mobs; but her mobs have had, in an unusual degree, the spirit of armies. The soldier, as compared with other soldiers, is deficient in military qualities; but the peasant has as much of those qualities as the soldier. In no country have such strong fortresses been taken by surprise: in no country have unfortified towns made so furious and obstinate a resistance to great armies. War in Spain has, from the days of the Romans, had a character of its own; it is a fire which cannot be raked out; it burns fiercely under the embers; and long after it has, to all seeming, been extinguished, bursts forth more violently than ever. This was seen in the last war. Spain had no army which could have looked in the face an equal number of French or Prussian soldiers; but one day laid the Prussian monarchy in the dust; one day put the crown of France at the disposal of invaders. No Jena, no Waterloo, would have enabled Joseph to reign in quiet at Madrid. The conduct of the Castilians throughout the War of the Succession was most characteristic. With all the odds of number and situation on their side, they had been ignominiously beaten. All the European dependencies of the Spanish crown were lost. Catalonia, Arragon, and Valencia had acknowledged the Austrian Prince. Gibraltar had been taken by a few sailors; Barcelona stormed by a few dismounted dragoons. The invaders had penetrated into the centre of the Peninsula, and were quartered at Madrid and Toledo. While these events had been in progress, the nation had scarcely given a sign of life. The rich could hardly be prevailed on to give or to lend for the support of war; the troops had shown neither discipline nor courage; and now at last, when it seemed that all was lost, when it seemed that the most sanguine must relinquish all hope, the national spirit awoke, fierce, proud, and unconquerable. The people had been sluggish when the circumstances might well have inspired hope; they reserved all their energy for what appeared to be a season of despair. Castile, Leon, Andalusia, Estremadura, rose at once; every peasant procured a firelock or a pike; the Allies were masters only of the ground on which they trod. No soldier could wander a hundred yards from the main body of the invading army without imminent risk of being poniarded. The country through which the conquerors had passed to Madrid, and which, as they thought, they had subdued, was all in arms behind them. Their communications with Portugal were cut off. In the meantime, money began, for the first time, to flow rapidly into the treasury of the fugitive King. "The day before yesterday," says the Princess Orsini, in a letter written at this time, "the priest of a village which contains only a hundred and twenty houses brought a hundred and twenty pistoles to the Queen. 'My flock,' said he, 'are ashamed to send you so little; but they beg you to believe that in this purse there are a hundred and twenty hearts faithful even to the death.' The good man wept as he spoke; and indeed we wept too. Yesterday another small village, in which there are only twenty houses, sent us fifty pistoles." While the Castilians were everywhere arming in the cause of Philip, the Allies were serving that cause as effectually by their mismanagement. Galway staid at Madrid, where his soldiers indulged in such boundless licentiousness that one half of them were in the hospitals. Charles remained dawdling in Catalonia. Peterborough had taken Requena, and wished to march from Valencia towards Madrid, and to effect a junction with Galway; but the Archduke refused his consent to the plan. The indignant general remained accordingly in his favourite city, on the beautiful shores of the Mediterranean, reading Don Quixote, giving balls and suppers, trying in vain to get some good sport out of the Valencia bulls, and making love, not in vain, to the Valencian women. At length the Archduke advanced into Castile, and ordered Peterborough to join him. But it was too late. Berwick had already compelled Galway to evacuate Madrid; and, when the whole force of the Allies was collected at Guadalaxara, it was found to be decidedly inferior in numbers to that of the enemy. Peterborough formed a plan for regaining possession of the capital. His plan was rejected by Charles. The patience of the sensitive and vainglorious hero was worn out. He had none of that serenity of temper which enabled Marlborough to act in perfect harmony with Eugene, and to endure the vexatious interference of the Dutch deputies. He demanded permission to leave the army. Permission was readily granted; and he set out for Italy. That there might be some pretext for his departure, he was commissioned by the Archduke to raise a loan in Genoa, on the credit of the revenues of Spain. From that moment to the end of the campaign the tide of fortune ran strong against the Austrian cause. Berwick had placed his army between the Allies and the frontiers of Portugal. They retreated on Valencia, and arrived in that Province, leaving about ten thousand prisoners in the hands of the enemy. In January 1707, Peterborough arrived at Valencia from Italy, no longer bearing a public character, but merely as a volunteer. His advice was asked, and it seems to have been most judicious. He gave it as his decided opinion that no offensive operations against Castile ought to be undertaken. It would be easy, he said, to defend Arragon, Catalonia, and Valencia, against Philip. The inhabitants of those parts of Spain were attached to the cause of the Archduke; and the armies of the House of Bourbon would be resisted by the whole population. In a short time the enthusiasm of the Castilians might abate. The government of Philip might commit unpopular acts. Defeats in the Netherlands might compel Lewis to withdraw the succours which he had furnished to his grandson. Then would be the time to strike a decisive blow. This excellent advice was rejected. Peterborough, who had now received formal letters of recall from England, departed before the opening of the campaign; and with him departed the good fortune of the Allies. Scarcely any general had ever done so much with means so small. Scarcely any general had ever displayed equal originality and boldness. He possessed, in the highest degree, the art of conciliating those whom he had subdued. But he was not equally successful in winning the attachment of those with whom he acted. He was adored by the Catalonians and Valencians; but he was hated by the prince whom he had all but made a great king, and by the generals whose fortune and reputation were staked on the same venture with his own. The English Government could not understand him. He was so eccentric that they gave him no credit for the judgment which he really possessed. One day he took towns with horse-soldiers; then again he turned some hundreds of infantry into cavalry at a minute's notice. He obtained his political intelligence chiefly by means of love affairs, and filled his despatches with epigrams. The ministers thought that it would be highly impolitic to intrust the conduct of the Spanish war to so volatile and romantic a person. They therefore gave the command to Lord Galway, an experienced veteran, a man who was in war what Moliere's doctors were in medicine, who thought it much more honourable to fail according to rule, than to succeed by innovation, and who would have been very much ashamed of himself if he had taken Monjuich by means so strange as those which Peterborough employed. This great commander conducted the campaign of 1707 in the most scientific manner. On the plain of Almanza he encountered the army of the Bourbons. He drew up his troops according to the methods prescribed by the best writers, and in a few hours lost eighteen thousand men, a hundred and twenty standards, all his baggage and all his artillery. Valencia and Arragon were instantly conquered by the French, and, at the close of the year, the mountainous province of Catalonia was the only part of Spain which still adhered to Charles. "Do you remember, child," says the foolish woman in the Spectator to her husband, "that the pigeon-house fell the very afternoon that our careless wench spilt the salt upon the table?" "Yes, my dear," replies the gentleman, "and the next post brought us an account of the battle of Almanza." The approach of disaster in Spain had been for some time indicated by omens much clearer than the mishap of the salt-cellar; an ungrateful prince, an undisciplined army, a divided council, envy triumphant over merit, a man of genius recalled, a pedant and a sluggard intrusted with supreme command. The battle of Almanza decided the fate of Spain. The loss was such as Marlborough or Eugene could scarcely have retrieved, and was certainly not to be retrieved by Stanhope and Staremberg. Stanhope, who took the command of the English army in Catalonia, was a man of respectable abilities, both in military and civil affairs, but fitter, we conceive, for a second than for a first place. Lord Mahon, with his usual candour, tells us, what we believe was not known before, that his ancestor's most distinguished exploit, the conquest of Minorca, was suggested by Marlborough. Staremberg, a methodical tactician of the German school, was sent by the emperor to command in Spain. Two languid campaigns followed, during which neither of the hostile armies did anything memorable, but during which both were nearly starved. At length, in 1710, the chiefs of the Allied forces resolved to venture on bolder measures. They began the campaign with a daring move, pushed into Arragon, defeated the troops of Philip at Almenara, defeated them again at Saragossa, and advanced to Madrid. The King was again a fugitive. The Castilians sprang to arms with the same enthusiasm which they had displayed in 1706. The conquerors found the capital a desert. The people shut themselves up in their houses, and refused to pay any mark of respect to the Austrian prince. It was necessary to hire a few children to shout before him in the streets. Meanwhile, the Court of Philip at Valladolid was thronged by nobles and prelates. Thirty thousand people followed their King from Madrid to his new residence. Women of rank, rather than remain behind, performed the journey on foot. The peasants enlisted by thousands. Money, arms, and provisions, were supplied in abundance by the zeal of the people. The country round Madrid was infested by small parties of irregular horse. The Allies could not send off a despatch to Arragon, or introduce a supply of provisions into the capital. It was unsafe for the Archduke to hunt in the immediate vicinity of the palace which he occupied. The wish of Stanhope was to winter in Castile. But he stood alone in the council of war; and, indeed it is not easy to understand how the Allies could have maintained themselves, through so unpropitious a season, in the midst of so hostile a population. Charles, whose personal safety was the first object of the generals, was sent with an escort of cavalry to Catalonia in November; and in December the army commenced its retreat towards Arragon. But the Allies had to do with a master-spirit. The King of France had lately sent the Duke of Vendome to command in Spain. This man was distinguished by the filthiness of his person, by the brutality of his demeanour, by the gross buffoonery of his conversation, and by the impudence with which he abandoned himself to the most nauseous of all vices. His sluggishness was almost incredible. Even when engaged in a campaign, he often passed whole days in his bed. His strange torpidity had been the cause of some of the most serious disasters which the armies of the House of Bourbon had sustained. But when he was roused by any great emergency, his resources, his energy, and his presence of mind, were such as had been found in no French general since the death of Luxembourg. At this crisis, Vendome was all himself. He set out from Talavera with his troops, and pursued the retreating army of the Allies with a speed perhaps never equalled, in such a season, and in such a country. He marched night and day. He swam, at the head of his cavalry, the flooded stream of Henares, and, in a few days, overtook Stanhope, who was at Brihuega with the left wing of the Allied army. "Nobody with me," says the English general, imagined that they had any foot within some days' march of us and our misfortune is owing to the incredible diligence which their army made." Stanhope had but just time to send off a messenger to the centre of the army, which was some leagues from Brihuega, before Vendome was upon him. The town was invested on every side. The walls were battered with cannon. A mine was sprung under one of the gates. The English kept up a terrible fire till their powder was spent. They then fought desperately with the bayonet against overwhelming odds. They burned the houses which the assailants had taken. But all was to no purpose. The British general saw that resistance could produce only a useless carnage. He concluded a capitulation; and his gallant little army became prisoners of war on honourable terms. Scarcely had Vendome signed the capitulation, when he learned that Staremberg was marching to the relief of Stanhope. Preparations were instantly made for a general action. On the day following that on which the English had delivered up their arms, was fought the obstinate and bloody fight of Villa Viciosa. Staremberg remained master of the field. Vendome reaped all the fruits of the battle. The Allies spiked their cannon, and retired towards Arragon. But even in Arragon they found no place to rest. Vendome was behind them. The guerilla parties were around them. They fled to Catalonia; but Catalonia was invaded by a French army from Roussillon. At length the Austrian general, with six thousand harassed and dispirited men, the remains of a great and victorious army, took refuge in Barcelona, almost the only place in Spain which still recognised the authority of Charles. Philip was now much safer at Madrid than his grandfather at Paris. All hope of conquering Spain in Spain was at an end. But in other quarters the House of Bourbon was reduced to the last extremity. The French armies had undergone a series of defeats in Germany, in Italy, and in the Netherlands. An immense force, flushed with victory, and commanded by the greatest generals of the age, was on the borders of France. Lewis had been forced to humble himself before the conquerors. He had even offered to abandon the cause of his grandson; and his offer had been rejected. But a great turn in affairs was approaching. The English administration which had commenced the war against the House of Bourbon was an administration composed of Tories. But the war was a Whig war. It was the favourite scheme of William, the Whig King. Lewis had provoked it by recognising, as sovereign of England, a prince peculiarly hateful to the Whigs. It had placed England in a position of marked hostility to that power from which alone the Pretender could expect efficient succour. It had joined England in the closest union to a Protestant and republican State, to a State which had assisted in bringing about the Revolution, and which was willing to guarantee the execution of the Act of Settlement. Marlborough and Godolphin found that they were more zealously supported by their old opponents than by their old associates. Those ministers who were zealous for the war were gradually converted to Whiggism. The rest dropped off, and were succeeded by Whigs. Cowper became Chancellor. Sunderland, in spite of the very just antipathy of Anne, was made Secretary of State. On the death of the Prince of Denmark a more extensive change took place. Wharton became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and Somers, President of the Council. At length the administration was wholly in the hands of the Low Church party. In the year 1710 a violent change took place. The Queen had always been a Tory at heart. Her religious feelings were all on the side of the Established Church. Her family feelings pleaded in favour of her exiled brother. Her selfish feelings disposed her to favour the zealots of prerogative. The affection which she felt for the Duchess of Marlborough was the great security of the Whigs. That affection had at length turned to deadly aversion. While the great party which had long swayed the destinies of Europe was undermined by bedchamber women at St. James's, a violent storm gathered in the country. A foolish parson had preached a foolish sermon against the principles of the Revolution. The wisest members of the Government were for letting the man alone. But Godolphin, inflamed with all the zeal of a new-made Whig, and exasperated by a nickname which was applied to him in this unfortunate discourse, insisted that the preacher should be impeached. The exhortations of the mild and sagacious Somers were disregarded. The impeachment was brought; the doctor was convicted; and the accusers were ruined. The clergy came to the rescue of the persecuted clergyman. The country gentlemen came to the rescue of the clergy. A display of Tory feelings, such as England had not witnessed since the closing years of Charles the Second's reign, appalled the ministers and gave boldness to the Queen. She turned out the Whigs, called Harley and St. John to power, and dissolved the Parliament. The elections went strongly against the late Government. Stanhope, who had in his absence, been put in nomination for Westminster, was defeated by a Tory candidate. The new ministers, finding themselves masters of the new Parliament, were induced by the strongest motives to conclude a peace with France. The whole system of alliance in which the country was engaged was a Whig system. The general by whom the English armies had constantly been led to victory, and for whom it was impossible to find a substitute, was now whatever he might formerly have been, a Whig general. If Marlborough were discarded it was probable that some great disaster would follow. Yet if he were to retain his command, every great action which he might perform would raise the credit of the party in opposition. A peace was therefore concluded between England and the Princes of the House of Bourbon. Of that peace Lord Mahon speaks in terms of the severest reprehension. He is, indeed, an excellent Whig of the time of the first Lord Stanhope. "I cannot but pause for a moment," says he, "to observe how much the course of a century has inverted the meaning of our party nicknames, how much a modern Tory resembles a Whig of Queen Anne's reign, and a Tory of Queen Anne's reign a modern Whig." We grant one half of Lord Mahon's proposition: from the other half we altogether dissent. We allow that a modern Tory resembles, in many things, a Whig of Queen Anne's reign. It is natural that such should be the case. The worst things of one age often resemble the best things of another. A modern shopkeeper's house is as well furnished as the house of a considerable merchant in Anne's reign. Very plain people now wear finer cloth than Beau Fielding or Beau Edgeworth could have procured in Queen Anne's reign. We would rather trust to the apothecary of a modern village than to the physician of a large town in Anne's reign. A modern boarding-school miss could tell the most learned professor of Anne's reign some things in geography, astronomy, and chemistry, which would surprise him. The science of government is an experimental science; and therefore it is, like all other experimental sciences, a progressive science. Lord Mahon would have been a very good Whig in the days of Harley. But Harley, whom Lord Mahon censures so severely, was very Whiggish when compared even with Clarendon; and Clarendon was quite a democrat when compared with Lord Burleigh. If Lord Mahon lives, as we hope he will, fifty years longer, we have no doubt that, as he now boasts of the resemblance which the Tories of our time bear to the Whigs of the Revolution, he will then boast of the resemblance borne by the Tories of 1882 to those immortal patriots, the Whigs of the Reform Bill. Society, we believe, is constantly advancing in knowledge. The tail is now where the head was some generations ago. But the head and the tail still keep their distance. A nurse of this century is as wise as a justice of the quorum and custalorum in Shallow's time. The wooden spoon of this year would puzzle a senior wrangler of the reign of George the Second. A boy from the National School reads and spells better than half the knights of the shire in the October Club. But there is still as wide a difference as ever between justices and nurses, senior wranglers and wooden spoons, members of Parliament and children at charity schools. In the same way, though a Tory may now be very like what a Whig was a hundred and twenty years ago, the Whig is as much in advance of the Tory as ever. The stag, in the Treatise on the Bathos, who "feared his hind feet would o'ertake the fore," was not more mistaken than Lord Mahon, if he thinks that he has really come up with the Whigs. The absolute position of the parties has been altered; the relative position remains unchanged. Through the whole of that great movement, which began before these party-names existed, and which will continue after they have become obsolete, through the whole of that great movement of which the Charter of John, the institution of the House of Commons, the extinction of Villanage, the separation from the see of Rome, the expulsion of the Stuarts, the reform of the Representative System, are successive stages, there have been, under some name or other, two sets of men, those who were before their age, and those who were behind it, those who were the wisest among their contemporaries, and those who gloried in being no wiser than their great-grandfathers. It is dreadful to think, that, in due time, the last of those who straggle in the rear of the great march will occupy the place now occupied by the advanced guard. The Tory Parliament of 1710 would have passed for a most liberal Parliament in the days of Elizabeth; and there are at present few members of the Conservative Club who would not have been fully qualified to sit with Halifax and Somers at the Kit-cat. Though, therefore, we admit that a modern Tory bears some resemblance to a Whig of Queen Anne's reign, we can by no means admit that a Tory of Anne's reign resembled a modern Whig. Have the modern Whigs passed laws for the purpose of closing the entrance of the House of Commons against the new interests created by trade? Do the modern Whigs hold the doctrine of divine right? Have the modern Whigs laboured to exclude all Dissenters from office and power? The modern Whigs are, indeed, at the present moment, like the Tories of 1712, desirous of peace, and of close union with France. But is there no difference between the France of 1712 and the France of 1832? Is France now the stronghold of the "Popish tyranny" and the "arbitrary power" against which our ancestors fought and prayed? Lord Mahon will find, we think, that his parallel is, in all essential circumstances, as incorrect as that which Fluellen drew between Macedon and Monmouth, or as that which an ingenious Tory lately discovered between Archbishop Williams and Archbishop Vernon. We agree with Lord Mahon in thinking highly of the Whigs of Queen Anne's reign. But that part of their conduct which he selects for especial praise is precisely the part which we think most objectionable. We revere them as the great champions of political and of intellectual liberty. It is true that, when raised to power, they were not exempt from the faults which power naturally engenders. It is true that they were men born in the seventeenth century, and that they were therefore ignorant of many truths which are familiar to the men of the nineteenth century. But they were, what the reformers of the Church were before them, and what the reformers of the House of Commons have been since, the leaders of their species in a right direction. It is true that they did not allow to political discussion that latitude which to us appears reasonable and safe; but to them we owe the removal of the Censorship. It is true that they did not carry the principle of religious liberty to its full extent; but to them we owe the Toleration Act. Though, however, we think that the Whigs of Anne's reign were, as a body, far superior in wisdom and public virtue to their contemporaries the Tories, we by no means hold ourselves bound to defend all the measures of our favourite party. A life of action, if it is to be useful, must be a life of compromise. But speculation admits of no compromise. A public man is often under the necessity of consenting to measures which he dislikes, lest he should endanger the success of measures which he thinks of vital importance. But the historian lies under no such necessity. On the contrary, it is one of his most sacred duties to point out clearly the errors of those whose general conduct he admires. It seems to us, then, that, on the great question which divided England during the last four years of Anne's reign, the Tories were in the right, and the Whigs in the wrong. That question was, whether England ought to conclude peace without exacting from Philip a resignation of the Spanish crown? No parliamentary struggle, from the time of the Exclusion Bill to the time of the Reform Bill, has been so violent as that which took place between the authors of the Treaty of Utrecht and the War Party. The Commons were for peace; the Lords were for vigorous hostilities. The Queen was compelled to choose which of her two highest prerogatives she would exercise, whether she would create Peers, or dissolve the Parliament. The ties of party superseded the ties of neighbourhood and of blood. The members of the hostile factions would scarcely speak to each other, or bow to each other. The women appeared at the theatres bearing the badges of their political sect. The schism extended to the most remote counties of England. Talents, such as had seldom before been displayed in political controversy, were enlisted in the service of the hostile parties. On one side was Steele, gay, lively, drunk with animal spirits and with factious animosity, and Addison, with his polished satire, his inexhaustible fertility of fancy, and his graceful simplicity of style. In the front of the opposite ranks appeared a darker and fiercer spirit, the apostate politician, the ribald priest, the perjured lover, a heart burning with hatred against the whole human race, a mind richly stored with images from the dung-hill and the lazar-house. The ministers triumphed, and the peace was concluded. Then came the reaction. A new sovereign ascended the throne. The Whigs enjoyed the confidence of the King and of the Parliament. The unjust severity with which the Tories had treated Marlborough and Walpole was more than retaliated. Harley and Prior were thrown into prison; Bolingbroke and Ormond were compelled to take refuge in a foreign land. The wounds inflicted in this desperate conflict continued to rankle for many years. It was long before the members of either party could discuss the question of the peace of Utrecht with calmness and impartiality. That the Whig ministers had sold us to the Dutch; that the Tory ministers had sold us to the French; that the war had been carried on only to fill the pockets of Marlborough; that the peace had been concluded only to facilitate the return of the Pretender; these imputations and many others, utterly ungrounded, or grossly exaggerated, were hurled backward and forward by the political disputants of the last century. In our time the question may be discussed without irritation. We will state, as concisely as possible, the reasons which have led us to the conclusion at which we have arrived. The dangers which were to be apprehended from the peace were two; first, the danger that Philip might be induced, by feelings of private affection, to act in strict concert with the elder branch of his house, to favour the French trade at the expense of England, and to side with the French Government in future wars; secondly, the danger that the posterity of the Duke of Burgundy might become extinct, that Philip might become heir by blood to the French crown, and that thus two great monarchies might be united under one sovereign. The first danger appears to us altogether chimerical. Family affection has seldom produced much effect on the policy of princes. The state of Europe at the time of the peace of Utrecht proved that in politics the ties of interest are much stronger than those of consanguinity or affinity. The Elector of Bavaria had been driven from his dominions by his father-in-law; Victor Amadeus was in arms against his sons-in-law; Anne was seated on a throne from which she had assisted to push a most indulgent father. It is true that Philip had been accustomed from childhood to regard his grandfather with profound veneration. It was probable, therefore, that the influence of Lewis at Madrid would be very great. But Lewis was more than seventy years old; he could not live long; his heir was an infant in the cradle. There was surely no reason to think that the policy of the King of Spain would be swayed by his regard for a nephew whom he had never seen. In fact, soon after the peace, the two branches of the House of Bourbon began to quarrel. A close alliance was formed between Philip and Charles, lately competitors for the Castilian crown. A Spanish princess, betrothed to the King of France, was sent back in the most insulting manner to her native country; and a decree was put forth by the Court of Madrid commanding every Frenchman to leave Spain. It is true that, fifty years after the peace of Utrecht, an alliance of peculiar strictness was formed between the French and Spanish Governments. But both Governments were actuated on that occasion, not by domestic affection, but by common interests and common enmities. Their compact, though called the Family Compact, was as purely a political compact as the league of Cambrai or the league of Pilnitz. The second danger was that Philip might have succeeded to the crown of his native country. This did not happen; but it might have happened; and at one time it seemed very likely to happen. A sickly child alone stood between the King of Spain and the heritage of Lewis the Fourteenth. Philip, it is true, solemnly renounced his claim to the French crown. But the manner in which he had obtained possession of the Spanish crown had proved the inefficacy of such renunciations. The French lawyers declared Philip's renunciation null, as being inconsistent with the fundamental law of the realm. The French people would probably have sided with him whom they would have considered as the rightful heir. Saint Simon, though much less zealous for hereditary monarchy than most of his countrymen, and though strongly attached to the Regent, declared, in the presence of that prince, that he never would support the claims of the House of Orleans against those of the King of Spain. "If such," he said, "be my feelings, what must be the feelings of others?" Bolingbroke, it is certain, was fully convinced that the renunciation was worth no more than the paper on which it was written, and demanded it only for the purpose of blinding the English Parliament and people. Yet, though it was at one time probable that the posterity of the Duke of Burgundy would become extinct, and though it is almost certain that, if the posterity of the Duke of Burgundy had become extinct, Philip would have successfully preferred his claim to the crown of France, we still defend the principle of the Treaty of Utrecht. In the first place, Charles had, soon after the battle of Villa-Viciosa, inherited, by the death of his elder brother, all the dominions of the House of Austria. Surely, if to these dominions he had added the whole monarchy of Spain, the balance of power would have been seriously endangered. The union of the Austrian dominions and Spain would not, it is true, have been so alarming an event as the union of France and Spain. But Charles was actually Emperor. Philip was not, and never might be, King of France. The certainty of the less evil might well be set against the chance of the greater evil. But, in fact, we do not believe that Spain would long have remained under the government either of an Emperor or of a King of France. The character of the Spanish people was a better security to the nations of Europe than any will, any instrument of renunciation, or any treaty. The same energy which the people of Castile had put forth when Madrid was occupied by the Allied armies, they would have again put forth as soon as it appeared that their country was about to become a French province. Though they were no longer masters abroad, they were by no means disposed to see foreigners set over them at home. If Philip had attempted to govern Spain by mandates from Versailles, a second Grand Alliance would easily have effected what the first had failed to accomplish. The Spanish nation would have rallied against him as zealously as it had before rallied round him. And of this he seems to have been fully aware. For many years the favourite hope of his heart was that he might ascend the throne of his grandfather; but he seems never to have thought it possible that he could reign at once in the country of his adoption and in the country of his birth. These were the dangers of the peace; and they seem to us to be of no very formidable kind. Against these dangers are to be set off the evils of war and the risk of failure. The evils of the war, the waste of life, the suspension of trade, the expenditure of wealth, the accumulation of debt, require no illustration. The chances of failure it is difficult at this distance of time to calculate with accuracy. But we think that an estimate approximating to the truth may, without much difficulty, be formed. The Allies had been victorious in Germany, Italy, and Flanders. It was by no means improbable that they might fight their way into the very heart of France. But at no time since the commencement of the war had their prospects been so dark in that country which was the very object of the struggle. In Spain they held only a few square leagues. The temper of the great majority of the nation was decidedly hostile to them. If they had persisted, if they had obtained success equal to their highest expectations, if they had gained a series of victories as splendid as those of Blenheim and Ramilies, if Paris had fallen, if Lewis had been a prisoner, we still doubt whether they would have accomplished their object. They would still have had to carry on interminable hostilities against the whole population of a country which affords peculiar facilities to irregular warfare, and in which invading armies suffer more from famine than from the sword. We are, therefore, for the peace of Utrecht. We are indeed no admirers of the statesmen who concluded that peace. Harley, we believe, was a solemn trifler, St. John a brilliant knave. The great body of their followers consisted of the country clergy and the country gentry; two classes of men who were then inferior in intelligence to decent shopkeepers or farmers of our time. Parson Barnabas, Parson Trulliber, Sir Wilful Witwould, Sir Francis Wronghead, Squire Western, Squire Sullen, such were the people who composed the main strength of the Tory party during the sixty years which followed the Revolution. It is true that the means by which the Tories came into power in 1710 were most disreputable. It is true that the manner in which they used their power was often unjust and cruel. It is true that, in order to bring about their favourite project of peace, they resorted to slander and deception, without the slightest scruple. It is true that they passed off on the British nation a renunciation which they knew to be invalid. It is true that they gave up the Catalans to the vengeance of Philip, in a manner inconsistent with humanity and national honour. But on the great question of Peace or War, we cannot but think that, though their motives may have been selfish and malevolent, their decision was beneficial to the State. But we have already exceeded our limits. It remains only for us to bid Lord Mahon heartily farewell, and to assure him that, whatever dislike we may feel for his political opinions, we shall always meet him with pleasure on the neutral ground of literature. FREDERIC THE GREAT (April 1842) Frederic the Great and his Times. Edited, with an Introduction, By THOMAS CAMPBELL, Esq. 2 vols. 8vo. London: 1842. THIS work, which has the high honour of being introduced to the world by the author of Lochiel and Hohenlinden, is not wholly unworthy of so distinguished a chaperon. It professes, indeed, to be no more than a compilation; but it is an exceedingly amusing compilation, and we shall be glad to have more of it. The narrative comes down at present only to the commencement of the Seven Years' War, and therefore does not comprise the most interesting portion of Frederic's reign. It may not be unacceptable to our readers that we should take this opportunity of presenting them with a slight sketch of the life of the greatest king that has, in modern times, succeeded by right of birth to a throne. It may, we fear, be impossible to compress so long and eventful a story within the limits which we must prescribe to ourselves. Should we be compelled to break off, we may perhaps, when the continuation of this work appears, return to the subject. The Prussian monarchy, the youngest of the great European, states, but in population and revenue the fifth among them, and in art, science, and civilisation entitled to the third, if not to the second place, sprang from a humble origin. About the beginning of the fifteenth century, the marquisate of Brandenburg was bestowed by the Emperor Sigismund on the noble family of Hohenzollern. In the sixteenth century that family embraced the Lutheran doctrines. It obtained from the King of Poland, early in the seventeenth century, the investiture of the duchy of Prussia. Even after this accession of territory, the chiefs of the house of Hohenzollern hardly ranked with the Electors of Saxony and Bavaria. The soil of Brandenburg was for the most part sterile. Even round Berlin, the capital of the province, and round Potsdam, the favourite residence of the Margraves, the country was a desert. In some places, the deep sand could with difficulty be forced by assiduous tillage to yield thin crops of rye and oats. In other places, the ancient forests, which the conquerors of the Roman Empire had descended on the Danube, remained untouched by the hand of man. Where the soil was rich it was generally marshy, and its insalubrity repelled the cultivators whom its fertility attracted. Frederic William, called the Great Elector, was the prince to whose policy his successors have agreed to ascribe their greatness. He acquired by the peace of Westphalia several valuable possessions, and among them the rich city and district of Magdeburg; and he left to his son Frederic a principality as considerable as any which was not called a kingdom. Frederic aspired to the style of royalty. Ostentatious and profuse, negligent of his true interests and of his high duties, insatiably eager for frivolous distinctions, he added nothing to the real weight of the state which he governed; perhaps he transmitted his inheritance to his children impaired rather than augmented in value; but he succeeded in gaining the great object of his life, the title of King. In the year 1700 he assumed this new dignity. He had on that occasion to undergo all the mortifications which fall to the lot of ambitious upstarts. Compared with the other crowned heads of Europe, he made a figure resembling that which a Nabob or a Commissary, who had bought a title, would make in the Company of Peers whose ancestors had been attainted for treason against the Plantagenets. The envy of the class which Frederic quitted, and the civil scorn of the class into which he intruded himself, were marked in very significant ways. The Elector of Saxony at first refused to acknowledge the new Majesty. Lewis the Fourteenth looked down on his brother King with an air not unlike that with which the Count in Moliere's play regards Monsieur Jourdain, just fresh from the mummery of being made a gentleman. Austria exacted large sacrifices in return for her recognition, and at last gave it ungraciously. Frederic was succeeded by his son, Frederic William, a prince who must be allowed to have possessed some talents for administration, but whose character was disfigured by odious vices, and whose eccentricities were such as had never before been seen out of a madhouse. He was exact and diligent in the transacting of business; and he was the first who formed the design of obtaining for Prussia a place among the European powers, altogether out of proportion to her extent and population by means of a strong military organisation. Strict economy enabled him to keep up a peace establishment of sixty thousand troops. These troops were disciplined in such a manner, that, placed beside them, the household regiments of Versailles and St. James's would have appeared an awkward squad. The master of such a force could not but be regarded by all his neighbours as a formidable enemy and a valuable ally. But the mind of Frederic William was so ill regulated, that all his inclinations became passions, and all his passions partook of the character of moral and intellectual disease. His parsimony degenerated into sordid avarice. His taste for military pomp and order became a mania, like that of a Dutch burgomaster for tulips, or that of a member of the Roxburghe Club for Caxtons. While the envoys of the Court of Berlin were in a state of such squalid poverty as moved the laughter of foreign capitals, while the food placed before the princes and princesses of the blood- royal of Prussia was too scanty to appease hunger, and so bad that even hunger loathed it, no price was thought too extravagant for tall recruits. The ambition of the King was to form a brigade of giants, and every country was ransacked by his agents for men above the ordinary stature. These researches were not confined to Europe. No head that towered above the crowd in the bazaars of Aleppo, of Cairo, or of Surat, could escape the crimps of Frederic William. One Irishman more than seven feet high, who was picked up in London by the Prussian ambassador, received a bounty of near thirteen hundred pounds sterling, very much more than the ambassador's salary. This extravagance was the more absurd, because a stout youth of five feet eight, who might have been procured for a few dollars, would in all probability have been a much more valuable soldier. But to Frederic William, this huge Irishman was what a brass Otho, or a Vinegar Bible, is to a collector of a different kind. It is remarkable, that though the main end of Frederic William's administration was to have a great military force, though his reign forms an important epoch in the history of military discipline, and though his dominant passion was the love of military display he was yet one of the most pacific of princes. We are afraid that his aversion to war was not the effect of humanity, but was merely one of his thousand whims. His feeling about his troops seems to have resembled a miser's feeling about his money. He loved to collect them, to count them, to see them increase; but he could not find it in his heart to break in upon the precious hoard. He looked forward to some future time when his Patagonian battalions were to drive hostile infantry before them like sheep; but this future time was always receding; and it is probable that, if his life had been prolonged thirty years, his superb army would never have seen any harder service than a sham fight in the fields near Berlin. But the great military means which he had collected were destined to be employed by a spirit far more daring and inventive than his own. Frederic, surnamed the Great, son of Frederic William, was born in January 1712. It may safely be pronounced that he had received from nature a strong and sharp understanding, and a rare firmness of temper and intensity of will. As to the other parts of his character, it is difficult to say whether they are to be ascribed to nature, or to the strange training which he underwent. The history of his boyhood is painfully interesting. Oliver Twist in the parish workhouse, Smike at Dotheboys Hall, were petted children when compared with this heir apparent of a crown. The nature of Frederic William was hard and bad, and the habit of exercising arbitrary power had made him frightfully savage. His rage constantly vented itself to right and left in curses and blows. When his Majesty took a walk, every human being fled before him, as if a tiger had broken loose from a menagerie. If he met a lady in the street, he gave her a kick, and told her to go home and mind her brats. If he saw a clergyman staring at the soldiers, he admonished the reverend gentleman to betake himself to study and prayer, and enforced this pious advice by a sound caning, administered on the spot. But it was in his own house that he was most unreasonable and ferocious. His palace was hell, and he the most execrable of fiends, a cross between Moloch and Puck. His son Frederic and his daughter Wilhelmina, afterwards Margravine of Bareuth, were in an especial manner objects of his aversion. His own mind was uncultivated. He despised literature. He hated infidels, papists, and metaphysicians, and did not very well understand in what they differed from each other. The business of life, according to him, was to drill and to be drilled. The recreations suited to a prince, were to sit in a cloud of tobacco smoke, to sip Swedish beer between the puffs of the pipe, to play backgammon for three halfpence a rubber, to kill wild hogs, and to shoot partridges by the thousand. The Prince Royal showed little inclination either for the serious employments or for the amusements of his father. He shirked the duties of the parade; he detested the fume of tobacco; he had no taste either for backgammon or for field sports. He had an exquisite ear, and performed skilfully on the flute. His earliest instructors had been French refugees, and they had awakened in him a strong passion for French literature and French society. Frederic William regarded these tastes as effeminate and contemptible, and, by abuse and persecution, made them still stronger. Things became worse when the Prince Royal attained that time of life at which the great revolution in the human mind and body takes place. He was guilty of some youthful indiscretions, which no good and wise parent would regard with severity. At a later period he was accused, truly or falsely, of vices from which History averts her eyes, and which even Satire blushes to name, vices such that, to borrow the energetic language of Lord Keeper Coventry, "the depraved nature of man, which of itself carrieth man to all other sin, abhorreth them." But the offences of his youth were not characterised by any peculiar turpitude. They excited, however, transports of rage in the King, who hated all faults except those to which he was himself inclined, and who conceived that he made ample atonement to Heaven for his brutality, by holding the softer passions in detestation. The Prince Royal, too, was not one of those who are content to take their religion on trust. He asked puzzling questions, and brought forward arguments which seemed to savour of something different from pure Lutheranism. The King suspected that his son was inclined to be a heretic of some sort or other, whether Calvinist or Atheist his Majesty did not very well know. The ordinary malignity of Frederic William was bad enough. He now thought malignity a part of his duty as a Christian man, and all the conscience that he had stimulated his hatred. The flute was broken: the French books were sent out of the palace: the Prince was kicked and cudgelled, and pulled by the hair. At dinner the plates were hurled at his head: sometimes he was restricted to bread and water: sometimes he was forced to swallow food so nauseous that he could not keep it on his stomach. Once his father knocked him down, dragged him along the floor to a window, and was with difficulty prevented from strangling him with the cord of the curtain. The Queen, for the crime of not wishing to see her son murdered, was subjected to the grossest indignities. The Princess Wilhelmina, who took her brother's part, was treated almost as ill as Mrs. Brownrigg's apprentices. Driven to despair, the unhappy youth tried to run away. Then the fury of the old tyrant rose to madness. The Prince was an officer in the army: his flight was therefore desertion; and, in the moral code of Frederic William, desertion was the highest of all crimes. "Desertion," says this royal theologian, in one of his half-crazy letters, "is from hell. It is a work of the children of the Devil. No child of God could possibly be guilty of it." An accomplice of the Prince, in spite of the recommendation of a court martial, was mercilessly put to death. It seemed probable that the Prince himself would suffer the same fate. It was with difficulty that the intercession of the States of Holland, of the Kings of Sweden and Poland, and of the Emperor of Germany, saved the House of Brandenburg from the stain of an unnatural murder. After months of cruel suspense, Frederic learned that his life would be spared. He remained, however, long a prisoner; but he was not on that account to be pitied. He found in his gaolers a tenderness which he had never found in his father; his table was not sumptuous, but he had wholesome food in sufficient quantity to appease hunger: he could read the Henriade without being kicked, and could play on his flute without having it broken over his head. When his confinement terminated he was a man. He had nearly completed his twenty-first year, and could scarcely be kept much longer under the restraints which had made his boyhood miserable. Suffering had matured his understanding, while it had hardened his heart and soured his temper. He had learnt self-command and dissimulation; he affected to conform to some of his father's views, and submissively accepted a wife, who was a wife only in name, from his father's hand. He also served with credit, though without any opportunity of acquiring brilliant distinction, under the command of Prince Eugene, during a campaign marked by no extraordinary events. He was now permitted to keep a separate establishment, and was therefore able to indulge with caution his own tastes. Partly in order to conciliate the King, and partly, no doubt, from inclination, he gave up a portion of his time to military and political business, and thus gradually acquired such an aptitude for affairs as his most intimate associates were not aware that he possessed. His favourite abode was at Rheinsberg, near the frontier which separates the Prussian dominions from the Duchy of Mecklenburg. Rheinsberg, is a fertile and smiling spot, in the midst of the sandy waste of the Marquisate. The mansion, surrounded by woods of oak and beech, looks out upon a spacious lake. There Frederic amused himself by laying out gardens in regular alleys and intricate mazes, by building obelisks, temples, and conservatories, and by collecting rare fruits and flowers. His retirement was enlivened by a few companions, among whom he seems to have preferred those who, by birth or extraction, were French. With these intimates he dined and supped well, drank freely, and amused himself sometimes with concerts, and sometimes with holding chapters of a fraternity which he called the Order of Bayard; but literature was his chief resource. His education had been entirely French. The long ascendency which Lewis the Fourteenth had enjoyed, and the eminent merit of the tragic and comic dramatists, of the satirists, and of the preachers who had flourished under that magnificent prince, had made the French language predominant in Europe. Even in countries which had a national literature, and which could boast of names greater than those of Racine, of Moliere, and of Massillon, in the country of Dante, in the country of Cervantes, in the country of Shakspeare and Milton, the intellectual fashions of Paris had been to a great extent adopted. Germany had not yet produced a single masterpiece of poetry or eloquence. In Germany, therefore, the French taste reigned without rival and without limit. Every youth of rank was taught to speak and write French. That he should speak and write his own tongue with politeness, or even with accuracy and facility, was regarded as comparatively an unimportant object. Even Frederic William, with all his rugged Saxon prejudices, thought it necessary that his children should know French, and quite unnecessary that they should be well versed in German. The Latin was positively interdicted. "My son," his Majesty wrote, "shall not learn Latin; and, more than that, I will not suffer anybody even to mention such a thing to me." One of the preceptors ventured to read the Golden Bull in the original with the Prince Royal. Frederic William entered the room, and broke out in his usual kingly style. "Rascal, what are you at there?" "Please your Majesty," answered the preceptor, "I was explaining the Golden Bull to his Royal Highness." "I'll Golden Bull you, you rascal! roared the Majesty of Prussia. Up went the King's cane away ran the terrified instructor; and Frederic's classical studies ended for ever. He now and then affected to quote Latin sentences, and produced such exquisitely Ciceronian phrases as these: "Stante pede morire"--"De gustibus non est disputandus,"--"Tot verbas tot spondera." Of Italian, he had not enough to read a page of Metastasio with ease; and of the Spanish and English, he did not, as far as we are aware, understand a single word. As the highest human compositions to which he had access were those of the French writers, it is not strange that his admiration for those writers should have been unbounded. His ambitious and eager temper early prompted him to imitate what he admired. The wish, perhaps, dearest to his heart was, that he might rank among the masters of French rhetoric and poetry. He wrote prose and verse as indefatigably as if he had been a starving hack of Cave or Osborn; but Nature, which had bestowed on him, in a large measure, the talents of a captain and of an administrator, had withheld from him those higher and rarer gifts, without which industry labours in vain to produce immortal eloquence and song. And, indeed, had he been blessed with more imagination, wit, and fertility of thought, than he appears to have had, he would still have been subject to one great disadvantage, which would, in all probability, have for ever prevented him from taking a high place among men of letters. He had not the full command of any language. There was no machine of thought which he could employ with perfect ease, confidence, and freedom. He had German enough to scold his servants, or to give the word of command to his grenadiers; but his grammar and pronunciation were extremely bad. He found it difficult to make out the meaning even of the simplest German poetry. On one occasion a version of Racine's Iphigenie was read to him. He held the French original in his hand; but was forced to own that, even with such help, he could not understand the translation. Yet, though he had neglected his mother tongue in order to bestow all his attention on French, his French was, after all, the French of a foreigner. It was necessary for him to have always at his beck some men of letters from Paris to point out the solecisms and false rhymes of which, to the last, he was frequently guilty. Even had he possessed the poetic faculty, of which, as far as we can judge, he was utterly destitute, the want of a language would have prevented him from being a great poet. No noble work of imagination, as far as we recollect, was ever composed by any man, except in a dialect which he had learned without remembering how or when, and which he had spoken with perfect ease before he had ever analysed its structure. Romans of great abilities wrote Greek verses; but how many of those verses have deserved to live? Many men of eminent genius have, in modern times, written Latin poems; but, as far as we are aware, none of those poems, not even Milton's, can be ranked in the first class of art, or even very high in the second. It is not strange, therefore, that, in the French verses of Frederic, we can find nothing beyond the reach of any man of good parts and industry, nothing above the level of Newdigate and Seatonian poetry. His best pieces may perhaps rank with the worst in Dodsley's collection. In history, he succeeded better. We do not, indeed, find, in any of his voluminous Memoirs, either deep reflection or vivid painting. But the narrative is distinguished by clearness, conciseness, good sense, and a certain air of truth and simplicity, which is singularly graceful in a man who, having done great things, sits down to relate them. On the whole, however, none of his writings are so agreeable to us as his Letters, particularly those which are written with earnestness, and are not embroidered with verses. It is not strange that a young man devoted to literature, and acquainted only with the literature of France, should have looked with profound veneration on the genius of Voltaire. "A man who has never seen the sun," says Calderon, in one of his charming comedies, "cannot be blamed for thinking that no glory can exceed that of the moon. A man who has seen neither moon nor sun, cannot be blamed for talking of the unrivalled brightness of the morning star." Had Frederic been able to read Homer and Milton or even Virgil and Tasso, his admiration of the Henriade would prove that he was utterly destitute of the power of discerning what is excellent in art. Had he been familiar with Sophocles or Shakspeare, we should have expected him to appreciate Zaire more justly. Had he been able to study Thucydides and Tacitus in the original Greek and Latin, he would have known that there were heights in the eloquence of history far beyond the reach of the author of the Life of Charles the Twelfth. But the finest heroic poem, several of the most powerful tragedies, and the most brilliant and picturesque historical work that Frederic had ever read, were Voltaire's. Such high and various excellence moved the young Prince almost to adoration. The opinions of Voltaire on religious and philosophical questions had not yet been fully exhibited to the public. At a later period, when an exile from his country, and at open war with the Church, he spoke out. But when Frederic was at Rheinsberg, Voltaire was still a courtier; and, though he could not always curb his petulant wit, he had as yet published nothing that could exclude him from Versailles, and little that a divine of the mild and generous school of Grotius and Tillotson might not read with pleasure. In the Henriade, in Zaire, and in Alzire, Christian piety is exhibited in the most amiable form; and, some years after the period of which we are writing, a Pope condescended to accept the dedication of Mahomet. The real sentiments of the poet, however, might be clearly perceived by a keen eye through the decent disguise with which he veiled them, and could not escape the sagacity of Frederic, who held similar opinions, and had been accustomed to practise similar dissimulation. The Prince wrote to his idol in the style of a worshipper; and Voltaire replied with exquisite grace and address. A correspondence followed, which may be studied with advantage by those who wish to become proficients in the ignoble art of flattery. No man ever paid compliments better than Voltaire. His sweetest confectionery had always a delicate, yet stimulating flavour, which was delightful to palates wearied by the coarse preparations of inferior artists. It was only from his hand that so much sugar could be swallowed without making the swallower sick. Copies of verses, writing-desks, trinkets of amber, were exchanged between the friends. Frederic confided his writings to Voltaire; and Voltaire applauded, as if Frederic had been Racine and Bossuet in one. One of his Royal Highness's performances was a refutation of Machiavelli. Voltaire undertook to convey it to the press. It was entitled the Anti-Machiavel, and was an edifying homily against rapacity, perfidy, arbitrary government, unjust war, in short, against almost everything for which its author is now remembered among men. The old King uttered now and then a ferocious growl at the diversions of Rheinsberg. But his health was broken; his end was approaching; and his vigour was impaired. He had only one pleasure left, that of seeing tall soldiers. He could always be propitiated by a present of a grenadier of six feet four or six feet five; and such presents were from time to time judiciously offered by his son. Early in the year 1740, Frederic William met death with a firmness and dignity worthy of a better and wiser man; and Frederic, who had just completed his twenty-eighth year, became King of Prussia. His character was little understood. That he had good abilities, indeed, no person who had talked with him, or corresponded with him, could doubt. But the easy Epicurean life which he had led, his love of good cookery and good wine, of music, of conversation, of light literature, led many to regard him as a sensual and intellectual voluptuary. His habit of canting about moderation, peace, liberty, and the happiness which a good mind derives from the happiness of others, had imposed on some who should have known better. Those who thought best of him, expected a Telemachus after Fenelon's pattern. Others predicted the approach of a Medicean age, an age propitious to learning and art, and not unpropitious to pleasure. Nobody had the least suspicion that a tyrant of extraordinary military and political talents, of industry more extraordinary still, without fear, without faith, and without mercy, had ascended the throne. The disappointment of Falstaff at his old boon-companion's coronation was not more bitter than that which awaited some of the inmates of Rheinsberg. They had long looked forward to the accession of their patron, as to the event from which their own prosperity and greatness was to date. They had at last reached the promised land, the land which they had figured to themselves as flowing with milk and honey; and they found it a desert. "No more of these fooleries," was the short, sharp admonition given by Frederic to one of them. It soon became plain that, in the most important points, the new sovereign bore a strong family likeness to his predecessor. There was indeed a wide difference between the father and the son as respected extent and vigour of intellect, speculative opinions, amusements, studies, outward demeanour. But the groundwork of the character was the same in both. To both were common the love of order, the love of business, the military taste, the parsimony, the imperious spirit, the temper irritable even to ferocity, the pleasure in the pain and humiliation of others. But these propensities had in Frederic William partaken of the general unsoundness of his mind, and wore a very different aspect when found in company with the strong and cultivated understanding of his successor. Thus, for example, Frederic was as anxious as any prince could be about the efficiency of his army. But this anxiety never degenerated into a monomania, like that which led his father to pay fancy prices for giants. Frederic was as thrifty about money as any prince or any private man ought to be. But he did not conceive, like his father, that it was worth while to eat unwholesome cabbages for the purpose of saving four or five rixdollars in the year. Frederic was, we fear, as malevolent as his father; but Frederic's wit enabled him often to show his malevolence in ways more decent than those to which his father resorted, and to inflict misery and degradation by a taunt instead of a blow. Frederic, it is true, by no means relinquished his hereditary privilege of kicking and cudgelling. His practice, however, as to that matter, differed in some important respects from his father's. To Frederic William, the mere circumstance that any persons whatever, men, women, or children, Prussians or foreigners, were within reach of his toes and of his cane, appeared to be a sufficient reason for proceeding to belabour them. Frederic required provocation as well as vicinity; nor was he ever known to inflict this paternal species of correction on any but his born subjects; though on one occasion M. Thiebault had reason, during a few seconds, to anticipate the high honour of being an exception to this general rule. The character of Frederic was still very imperfectly understood either by his subjects or by his neighbours, when events occurred which exhibited it in a strong light. A few months after his accession died Charles the Sixth, Emperor of Germany, the last descendant, in the male line, of the House of Austria. Charles left no son, and had, long before his death, relinquished all hopes of male issue. During the latter part of his life, his principal object had been to secure to his descendants in the female line the many crowns of the House of Hapsburg. With this view, he had promulgated a new law of succession, widely celebrated throughout Europe under the name of the Pragmatic Sanction. By virtue of this law, his daughter, the Archduchess Maria Theresa, wife of Francis of Lorraine, succeeded to the dominions of her ancestors. No sovereign has ever taken possession of a throne by a clearer title. All the politics of the Austrian cabinet had, during twenty years, been directed to one single end, the settlement of the succession. From every person whose rights could be considered as injuriously affected, renunciations in the most solemn form had been obtained. The new law had been ratified by the Estates of all the kingdoms and principalities which made up the great Austrian monarchy. England, France, Spain, Russia, Poland, Prussia, Sweden, Denmark, the Germanic body, had bound themselves by treaty to maintain the Pragmatic Sanction. That instrument was placed under the protection of the public faith of the whole civilised world. Even if no positive stipulations on this subject had existed, the arrangement was one which no good man would have been willing to disturb. It was a peaceable arrangement. It was an arrangement acceptable to the great population whose happiness was chiefly concerned. It was an arrangement which made no change in the distribution of power among the states of Christendom. It was an arrangement which could be set aside only by means of a general war; and, if it were set aside, the effect would be, that the equilibrium of Europe would be deranged, that the loyal and patriotic feelings of millions would be cruelly outraged, and that great provinces which had been united for centuries would be torn from each other by main force. The sovereigns of Europe were, therefore, bound by every obligation which those who are intrusted with power over their fellow-creatures ought to hold most sacred, to respect and defend the rights of the Archduchess. Her situation and her personal qualities were such as might be expected to move the mind of any generous man to pity, admiration, and chivalrous tenderness. She was in her twenty-fourth year. Her form was majestic, her features beautiful, her countenance sweet and animated, her voice musical, her deportment gracious and dignified, In all domestic relations she was without reproach. She was married to a husband whom she loved, and was on the point of giving birth to a child, when death deprived her of her father. The loss of a parent, and the new cares of empire, were too much for her in the delicate state of her health. Her spirits were depressed, and her cheek lost its bloom. Yet it seemed that she had little cause for anxiety. It seemed that justice, humanity, and the faith of treaties would have their due weight, and that the settlement so solemnly guaranteed would be quietly carried into effect. England, Russia, Poland, and Holland, declared in form their intention to adhere to their engagements. The French ministers made a verbal declaration to the same effect. But from no quarter did the young Queen of Hungary receive stronger assurances of friendship and support than from the King of Prussia. Yet the King of Prussia, the Anti-Machiavel, had already fully determined to commit the great crime of violating his plighted faith, of robbing the ally whom he was bound to defend, and of plunging all Europe into a long, bloody, and desolating war; and all this for no end whatever, except that he might extend his dominions, and see his name in the gazettes. He determined to assemble a great army with speed and secrecy, to invade Silesia before Maria Theresa should be apprised of his design, and to add that rich province to his kingdom. We will not condescend to refute at length the pleas which the compiler of the Memoirs before us has copied from Doctor Preuss. They amount to this, that the House of Brandenburg had some ancient pretensions to Silesia, and had in the previous century been compelled, by hard usage on the part of the Court of Vienna, to waive those pretensions. It is certain that, whoever might originally have been in the right, Prussia had submitted. Prince after prince of the House of Brandenburg had acquiesced in the existing arrangement. Nay, the Court of Berlin had recently been allied with that of Vienna, and had guaranteed the integrity of the Austrian states. Is it not perfectly clear that, if antiquated claims are to be set up against recent treaties and long possession, the world can never be at peace for a day? The laws of all nations have wisely established a time of limitation, after which titles, however illegitimate in their origin, cannot be questioned. It is felt by everybody, that to eject a person from his estate on the ground of some injustice committed in the time of the Tudors would produce all the evils which result from arbitrary confiscation, and would make all property insecure. It concerns the commonwealth--so runs the legal maxim--that there be an end of litigation. And surely this maxim is at least equally applicable to the great commonwealth of states; for in that commonwealth litigation means the devastation of provinces, the suspension of trade and industry, sieges like those of Badajoz and St. Sebastian, pitched fields like those of Eylau and Borodino. We hold that the transfer of Norway from Denmark to Sweden was an unjustifiable proceeding; but would the King of Denmark be therefore justified in landing, without any new provocation in Norway, and commencing military operations there? The King of Holland thinks, no doubt, that he was unjustly deprived of the Belgian provinces. Grant that it were so. Would he, therefore, be justified in marching with an army on Brussels? The case against Frederic was still stronger, inasmuch as the injustice of which he complained had been committed more than a century before. Nor must it be forgotten that he owed the highest personal obligations to the House of Austria. It may be doubted whether his life had not been preserved by the intercession of the prince whose daughter he was about to plunder. To do the King justice, he pretended to no more virtue than he had. In manifestoes he might, for form's sake, insert some idle stories about his antiquated claim on Silesia; but in his conversations and Memoirs he took a very different tone. His own words are: "Ambition, interest, the desire of making people talk about me, carried the day; and I decided for war." Having resolved on his course, he acted with ability and vigour. It was impossible wholly to conceal his preparations; for throughout the Prussian territories regiments, guns, and baggage were in motion. The Austrian envoy at Berlin apprised his court of these facts, and expressed a suspicion of Frederic's designs; but the ministers of Maria Theresa refused to give credit to so black an imputation on a young prince, who was known chiefly by his high professions of integrity and philanthropy. "We will not," they wrote, "we cannot, believe it." In the meantime the Prussian forces had been assembled. Without any declaration of war, without any demand for reparation, in the very act of pouring forth compliments and assurances of goodwill, Frederic commenced hostilities. Many thousands of his troops were actually in Silesia before the Queen of Hungary knew that he had set up any claim to any part of her territories. At length he sent her a message which could be regarded only as an insult. If she would but let him have Silesia, he would, he said, stand by her against any power which should try to deprive her of her other dominions; as if he was not already bound to stand by her, or as if his new promise could be of more value than the old one. It was the depth of winter. The cold was severe, and the roads heavy with mire. But the Prussians pressed on. Resistance was impossible. The Austrian army was then neither numerous nor efficient. The small portion of that army which lay in Silesia was unprepared for hostilities. Glogau was blockaded; Breslau opened its gates; Ohlau was evacuated. A few scattered garrisons still held out; but the whole open country was subjugated: no enemy ventured to encounter the King in the field; and, before the end of January 1741, he returned to receive the congratulations of his subjects at Berlin. Had the Silesian question been merely a question between Frederic and Maria Theresa, it would be impossible to acquit the Prussian King of gross perfidy. But when we consider the effects which his policy produced, and could not fail to produce, on the whole community of civilised nations, we are compelled to pronounce a condemnation still more severe. Till he began the war, it seemed possible, even probable, that the peace of the world would be preserved. The plunder of the great Austrian heritage was indeed a strong temptation; and in more than one cabinet ambitious schemes were already meditated. But the treaties by which the Pragmatic Sanction had been guaranteed were express and recent. To throw all Europe into confusion for a purpose clearly unjust, was no light matter. England was true to her engagements. The voice of Fleury had always been for peace. He had a conscience. He was now in extreme old age, and was unwilling, after a life which, when his situation was considered, must be pronounced singularly pure, to carry the fresh stain of a great crime before the tribunal of his God. Even the vain and unprincipled Belle- Isle, whose whole life was one wild day-dream of conquest and spoliation, felt that France, bound as she was by solemn stipulations, could not, without disgrace, make a direct attack on the Austrian dominions. Charles, Elector of Bavaria, pretended that he had a right to a large part of the inheritance which the Pragmatic Sanction gave to the Queen of Hungary; but he was not sufficiently powerful to move without support. It might, therefore, not unreasonably be expected that, after a short period of restlessness, all the potentates of Christendom would acquiesce in the arrangements made by the late Emperor. But the selfish rapacity of the King of Prussia gave the signal to his neighbours. His example quieted their sense of shame. His success led them to underrate the difficulty of dismembering the Austrian monarchy. The whole world sprang to arms. On the head of Frederic is all the blood which was shed in a war which raged during many years and in every quarter of the globe, the blood of the column of Fontenoy, the blood of the mountaineers who were slaughtered at Culloden. The evils produced by his wickedness were felt in lands where the name of Prussia was unknown; and, in order that he might rob a neighbour whom he had promised to defend, black men fought on the coast of Coromandel, and red men scalped each other by the Great Lakes of North America. Silesia had been occupied without a battle; but the Austrian troops were advancing to the relief of the fortresses which still held out. In the spring Frederic rejoined his army. He had seen little of war, and had never commanded any great body of men in the field. It is not, therefore, strange that his first military operations showed little of that skill which, at a later period, was the admiration of Europe. What connoisseurs say of some pictures painted by Raphael in his youth, may be said of this campaign. It was in Frederic's early bad manner. Fortunately for him, the generals to whom he was opposed were men of small capacity. The discipline of his own troops, particularly of the infantry, was unequalled in that age; and some able and experienced officers were at hand to assist him with their advice. Of these, the most distinguished was Field-Marshal Schwerin, a brave adventurer of Pomeranian extraction, who had served half the governments in Europe, had borne the commissions of the States-General of Holland and of the Duke of Mecklenburg, had fought under Marlborough at Blenheim, and had been with Charles the Twelfth at Bender. Frederic's first battle was fought at Molwitz; and never did the career of a great commander open in a more inauspicious manner. His army was victorious. Not only, however, did he not establish his title to the character of an able general; but he was so unfortunate as to make it doubtful whether he possessed the vulgar courage of a soldier. The cavalry, which he commanded in person, was put to flight. Unaccustomed to the tumult and carnage of a field of battle, he lost his self-possession, and listened too readily to those who urged him to save himself. His English grey carried him many miles from the field, while Schwerin, though wounded in two places, manfully upheld the day. The skill of the old Field-Marshal and the steadiness of the Prussian battalions prevailed; and the Austrian army was driven from the field with the loss of eight thousand men. The news was carried late at night to a mill in which the King had taken shelter. It gave him a bitter pang. He was successful; but he owed his success to dispositions which others had made, and to the valour of men who had fought while he was flying. So unpromising was the first appearance of the greatest warrior of that age. The battle of Molwitz was the signal for a general explosion throughout Europe. Bavaria took up arms. France, not yet declaring herself a principal in the war, took part in it as an ally of Bavaria. The two great statesmen to whom mankind had owed many years of tranquillity, disappeared about this time from the scene, but not till they had both been guilty of the weakness of sacrificing their sense of justice and their love of peace to the vain hope of preserving their power. Fleury, sinking under age and infirmity, was borne down by the impetuosity of Belle-Isle. Walpole retired from the service of his ungrateful country to his woods and paintings at Houghton; and his power devolved on the daring and eccentric Carteret. As were the ministers, so were the nations. Thirty years during which Europe had, with few interruptions, enjoyed repose, had prepared the public mind for great military efforts. A new generation had grown up, which could not remember the siege of Turin or the slaughter of Malplaquet; which knew war by nothing but its trophies; and which, while it looked with pride on the tapestries at Blenheim, or the statue in the Place of Victories, little thought by what privations, by what waste of private fortunes, by how many bitter tears, conquests must be purchased. For a time fortune seemed adverse to the Queen of Hungary. Frederic invaded Moravia. The French and Bavarians penetrated into Bohemia, and were there joined by the Saxons. Prague was taken. The Elector of Bavaria was raised by the suffrages of his colleagues to the Imperial throne, a throne which the practice of centuries had almost entitled the House of Austria to regard as a hereditary possession. Yet was the spirit of the haughty daughter of the Caesars unbroken. Hungary was still hers by an unquestionable title; and although her ancestors had found Hungary the most mutinous of all their kingdoms, she resolved to trust herself to the fidelity of a people, rude indeed, turbulent, and impatient of oppression, but brave, generous, and simple-hearted. In the midst of distress and peril she had given birth to a son, afterwards the Emperor Joseph the Second. Scarcely had she arisen from her couch, when she hastened to Presburg. There, in the sight of an innumerable multitude, she was crowned with the crown and robed with the robe of St. Stephen. No spectator could restrain his tears when the beautiful young mother, still weak from child-bearing, rode, after the fashion of her fathers, up the Mount of Defiance, unsheathed the ancient sword of state, shook it towards north and south, east and west, and, with a glow on her pale face, challenged the four corners of the world to dispute her rights and those of her boy. At the first sitting of the Diet she appeared clad in deep mourning for her father, and in pathetic and dignified words implored her people to support her just cause. Magnates and deputies sprang up, half drew their sabres, and with eager voices vowed to stand by her with their lives and fortunes. Till then, her firmness had never once forsaken her before the public eye; but at that shout she sank down upon her throne, and wept aloud. Still more touching was the sight when, a few days later, she came again before the Estates of her realm, and held up before them the little Archduke in her arms. Then it was that the enthusiasm of Hungary broke forth into that war-cry which soon resounded throughout Europe, "Let us die for our King, Maria Theresa!" In the meantime, Frederic was meditating a change of policy. He had no wish to raise France to supreme power on the Continent, at the expense of the House of Hapsburg. His first object was to rob the Queen of Hungary. His second object was that, if possible, nobody should rob her but himself. He had entered into engagements with the powers leagued against Austria; but these engagements were in his estimation of no more force than the guarantee formerly given to the Pragmatic Sanction. His plan now was to secure his share of the plunder by betraying his accomplices. Maria Theresa was little inclined to listen to any such compromise; but the English Government represented to her so strongly the necessity of buying off Frederic, that she agreed to negotiate. The negotiation would not, however, have ended in a treaty, had not the arms of Frederic been crowned with a second victory. Prince Charles of Lorraine, brother-in-law to Maria Theresa, a bold and active, though unfortunate general, gave battle to the Prussians at Chotusitz, and was defeated. The King was still only a learner of the military art. He acknowledged, at a later period, that his success on this occasion was to be attributed, not at all to his own generalship, but solely to the valour and steadiness of his troops. He completely effaced, however, by his personal courage and energy, the stain which Molwitz had left on his reputation. A peace, concluded under the English mediation, was the fruit of this battle. Maria Theresa ceded Silesia: Frederic abandoned his allies: Saxony followed his example; and the Queen was left at liberty to turn her whole force against France and Bavaria. She was everywhere triumphant. The French were compelled to evacuate Bohemia, and with difficulty effected their escape. The whole line of their retreat might be tracked by the corpses of thousands who had died of cold, fatigue, and hunger. Many of those who reached their country carried with them the seeds of death. Bavaria was overrun by bands of ferocious warriors from that bloody debatable land which lies on the frontier between Christendom and Islam. The terrible names of the Pandoor, the Croat, and the Hussar, then first became familiar to Western Europe. The unfortunate Charles of Bavaria, vanquished by Austria, betrayed by Prussia, driven from his hereditary states, and neglected by his allies, was hurried by shame and remorse to an untimely end. An English army appeared in the heart of Germany, and defeated the French at Dettingen. The Austrian captains already began to talk of completing the work of Marlborough and Eugene, and of compelling France to relinquish Alsace and the three Bishoprics. The Court of Versailles, in this peril, looked to Frederic for help. He had been guilty of two great treasons: perhaps he might be induced to commit a third. The Duchess of Chateauroux then held the chief influence over the feeble Lewis. She, determined to send an agent to Berlin; and Voltaire was selected for the mission. He eagerly undertook the task; for, while his literary fame filled all Europe, he was troubled with a childish craving for political distinction. He was vain, and not without reason, of his address, and of his insinuating eloquence: and he flattered himself that he possessed boundless influence over the King of Prussia. The truth was that he knew, as yet, only one corner of Frederic's character. He was well acquainted with all the petty vanities and affectations of the poetaster; but was not aware that these foibles were united with all the talents and vices which lead to success in active life, and that the unlucky versifier who pestered him with reams of middling Alexandrines, was the most vigilant, suspicious, and severe of politicians. Voltaire was received with every mark of respect and friendship, was lodged in the palace, and had a seat daily at the royal table. The negotiation was of an extraordinary description. Nothing can be conceived more whimsical than the conferences which took place between the first literary man and the first practical man of the age, whom a strange weakness had induced to exchange their parts. The great poet would talk of nothing but treaties and guarantees, and the great King of nothing but metaphors and rhymes. On one occasion Voltaire put into his Majesty's hands a paper on the state of Europe, and received it back with verses scrawled on the margin. In secret they both laughed at each other. Voltaire did not spare the King's poems; and the King has left on record his opinion of Voltaire's diplomacy. "He had no credentials," says Frederic, "and the whole mission was a joke, a mere farce." But what the influence of Voltaire could not effect, the rapid progress of the Austrian arms effected. If it should be in the power of Maria Theresa and George the Second to dictate terms of peace to France, what chance was there that Prussia would long retain Silesia? Frederic's conscience told him that he had acted perfidiously and inhumanly towards the Queen of Hungary. That her resentment was strong she had given ample proof; and of her respect for treaties he judged by his own. Guarantees, he said, were mere filigree, pretty to look at, but too brittle to bear the slightest pressure. He thought it his safest course to ally himself closely to France, and again to attack the Empress Queen. Accordingly, in the autumn of 1744, without notice, without any decent pretext, he recommenced hostilities, marched through the electorate of Saxony without troubling himself about the permission of the Elector, invaded Bohemia, took Prague, and even menaced Vienna. It was now that, for the first time, he experienced the inconstancy of fortune. An Austrian army under Charles of Lorraine threatened his communications with Silesia. Saxony was all in arms behind him. He found it necessary to save himself by a retreat. He afterwards owned that his failure was the natural effect of his own blunders. No general, he said, had ever committed greater faults. It must be added, that to the reverses of this campaign he always ascribed his subsequent successes. It was in the midst of difficulty and disgrace that he caught the first clear glimpse of the principles of the military art. The memorable year 1745 followed. The war raged by sea and land, in Italy, in Germany, and in Flanders; and even England, after many years of profound internal quiet, saw, for the last time, hostile armies set in battle array against each other. This year is memorable in the life of Frederic, as the date at which his noviciate in the art of war may be said to have terminated. There have been great captains whose precocious and self-taught military skill resembled intuition. Conde, Clive, and Napoleon are examples. But Frederic was not one of these brilliant portents. His proficiency in military science was simply the proficiency which a man of vigorous faculties makes in any science to which he applies his mind with earnestness and industry. It was at Hohenfriedberg that he first proved how much he had profited by his errors, and by their consequences. His victory on that day was chiefly due to his skilful dispositions, and convinced Europe that the prince who, a few years before, had stood aghast in the rout of Molwitz, had attained in the military art a mastery equalled by none of his contemporaries, or equalled by Saxe alone. The victory of Hohenfriedberg was speedily followed by that of Sorr. In the meantime, the arms of France had been victorious in the Low Countries. Frederic had no longer reason to fear that Maria Theresa would be able to give law to Europe, and he began to meditate a fourth breach of his engagements. The Court of Versailles was alarmed and mortified. A letter of earnest expostulation, in the handwriting of Lewis, was sent to Berlin; but in vain. In the autumn of 1745, Frederic made Peace with England, and, before the close of the year, with Austria also. The pretensions of Charles of Bavaria could present no obstacle to an accommodation. That unhappy Prince was no more; and Francis of Lorraine, the husband of Maria Theresa, was raised, with the general assent of the Germanic body, to the Imperial throne. Prussia was again at peace; but the European war lasted till, in the year 1748, it was terminated by the treaty of Aix-la Chapelle. Of all the powers that had taken part in it, the only gainer was Frederic. Not only had he added to his patrimony the fine province of Silesia: he had, by his unprincipled dexterity, succeeded so well in alternately depressing the scale of Austria and that of France, that he was generally regarded as holding the balance of Europe, a high dignity for one who ranked lowest among kings, and whose great-grandfather had been no more than a Margrave. By the public, the King of Prussia was considered as a politician destitute alike of morality and decency, insatiably rapacious, and shamelessly false; nor was the public much in the wrong. He was at the same time, allowed to be a man of parts, a rising general, a shrewd negotiator and administrator. Those qualities wherein he surpassed all mankind, were as yet unknown to others or to himself; for they were qualities which shine out only on a dark ground. His career had hitherto, with little interruption, been prosperous; and it was only in adversity, in adversity which seemed without hope or resource, in adversity which would have overwhelmed even men celebrated for strength of mind, that his real greatness could be shown. He had, from the commencement of his reign, applied himself to public business after a fashion unknown among kings. Lewis the Fourteenth, indeed, had been his own prime minister, and had exercised a general superintendence over all the departments of the Government; but this was not sufficient for Frederic. He was not content with being his own prime minister: he would be his own sole minister. Under him there was no room, not merely for a Richelieu or a Mazarin, but for a Colbert, a Louvois, or a Torcy. A love of labour for its own sake, a restless and insatiable longing to dictate, to intermeddle, to make his power felt, a profound scorn and distrust of his fellow-creatures, made him unwilling to ask counsel, to confide important secrets, to delegate ample powers. The highest functionaries under his government were mere clerks, and were not so much trusted by him as valuable clerks are often trusted by the heads of departments. He was his own treasurer, his own commander-in-chief, his own intendant of public works, his own minister for trade and justice, for home affairs and foreign affairs, his own master of the horse, steward, and chamberlain. Matters of which no chief of an office in any other government would ever hear, were, in this singular monarchy, decided by the King in person. If a traveller wished for a good place to see a review, he had to write to Frederic, and received next day, from a royal messenger, Frederic's answer signed by Frederic's own hand. This was an extravagant, a morbid activity. The public business would assuredly have been better done if each department had been put under a man of talents and integrity, and if the King had contented himself with a general control. In this manner the advantages which belong to unity of design, and the advantages which belong to the division of labour, would have been to a great extent combined. But such a system would not have suited the peculiar temper of Frederic. He could tolerate no will, no reason, in the State, save his own. He wished for no abler assistance than that of penmen who had just understanding enough to translate and transcribe, to make out his scrawls, and to put his concise Yes and No into an official form. Of the higher intellectual faculties, there is as much in a copying machine, or a lithographic press, as he required from a secretary of the cabinet. His own exertions were such as were hardly to be expected from a human body or a human mind. At Potsdam, his ordinary residence, he rose at three in summer and four in winter. A page soon appeared, with a large basket full of all the letters which had arrived for the King by the last courier, despatches from ambassadors, reports from officers of revenue, plans of buildings, proposals for draining marshes, complaints from persons who thought themselves aggrieved, applications from persons who wanted titles, military commissions, and civil situations. He examined the seals with a keen eye; for he was never for a moment free from the suspicion that some fraud might be practised on him. Then he read the letters, divided them into several packets, and signified his pleasure, generally by a mark, often by two or three words, now and then by some cutting epigram. By eight he had generally finished this part of his task. The adjutant-general was then in attendance, and received instructions for the day as to all the military arrangements of the kingdom. Then the King went to review his guards, not as kings ordinarily review their guards, but with the minute attention and severity of an old drill-sergeant. In the meantime the four cabinet secretaries had been employed in answering the letters on which the King had that morning signified his will. These unhappy men were forced to work all the year round like negro slaves in the time of the sugar-crop. They never had a holiday. They never knew what it was to dine. It was necessary that, before they stirred, they should finish the whole of their work. The King, always on his guard against treachery, took from the heap a handful of letters at random, and looked into them to see whether his instructions had been exactly followed. This was no bad security against foul play on the part of the secretaries; for if one of them were detected in a trick, he might think himself fortunate if he escaped with five years of imprisonment in a dungeon. Frederic then signed the replies, and all were sent off the same evening. The general principles on which this strange government was conducted, deserve attention. The policy of Frederic was essentially the same as his father's; but Frederic, while he carried that policy to lengths to which his father never thought of carrying it, cleared it at the same time from the absurdities with which his father had encumbered it. The King's first object was to have a great, efficient, and well-trained army. He had a kingdom which in extent and population was hardly in the second rank of European powers; and yet he aspired to a place not inferior to that of the sovereigns of England, France, and Austria. For that end it was necessary that Prussia should be all sting. Lewis the Fifteenth, with five times as many subjects as Frederic, and more than five times as large a revenue, had not a more formidable army. The proportion which the soldiers in Prussia bore to the people seems hardly credible. Of the males in the vigour of life, a seventh part were probably under arms; and this great force had, by drilling, by reviewing, and by the unsparing use of cane and scourge, been taught to form all evolutions with a rapidity and a precision which would have astonished Villars or Eugene. The elevated feelings which are necessary to the best kind of army were then wanting to the Prussian service. In those ranks were not found the religious and political enthusiasm which inspired the pikemen of Cromwell, the patriotic ardour, the thirst of glory, the devotion to a great leader, which inflamed the Old Guard of Napoleon. But in all the mechanical parts of the military calling, the Prussians were as superior to the English and French troops of that day as the English and French troops to a rustic militia. Though the pay of the Prussian soldier was small, though every rixdollar of extraordinary charge was scrutinised by Frederic with a vigilance and suspicion such as Mr. Joseph Hume never brought to the examination of an army estimate, the expense of such an establishment was, for the means of the country, enormous. In order that it might not be utterly ruinous, it was necessary that every other expense should be cut down to the lowest possible point. Accordingly Frederic, though his dominions bordered on the sea, had no navy. He neither had nor wished to have colonies. His judges, his fiscal officers, were meanly paid. His ministers at foreign courts walked on foot, or drove shabby old carriages till the axle-trees gave way. Even to his highest diplomatic agents, who resided at London and Paris, he allowed less than a thousand pounds sterling a year. The royal household was managed with a frugality unusual in the establishments of opulent subjects, unexampled in any other palace. The King loved good eating and drinking, and during great part of his life took pleasure in seeing his table surrounded by guests; yet the whole charge of his kitchen was brought within the sum of two thousand pounds sterling a year. He examined every extraordinary item with a care which might be thought to suit the mistress of a boarding- house better than a great prince. When more than four rixdollars were asked of him for a hundred oysters, he stormed as if he had heard that one of his generals had sold a fortress to the Empress Queen. Not a bottle of champagne was uncorked without his express order. The game of the royal parks and forests, a serious head of expenditure in most kingdoms, was to him a source of profit. The whole was farmed out; and though the farmers were almost ruined by their contract, the King would grant them no remission. His wardrobe consisted of one fine gala dress, which lasted him all his life; of two or three old coats fit for Monmouth Street, of yellow waistcoats soiled with snuff, and of huge boots embrowned by time. One taste alone sometimes allured him beyond the limits of parsimony, nay, even beyond the limits of prudence, the taste for building. In all other things his economy was such as we might call by a harsher name, if we did not reflect that his funds were drawn from a heavily taxed people, and that it was impossible for him, without excessive tyranny, to keep up at once a formidable army and a splendid court. Considered as an administrator, Frederic had undoubtedly many titles to praise. Order was strictly maintained throughout his dominions. Property was secure. A great liberty of speaking and of writing was allowed. Confident in the irresistible strength derived from a great army, the King looked down on malcontents and libellers with a wise disdain; and gave little encouragement to spies and informers. When he was told of the disaffection of one of his subject, he merely asked, "How many thousand men can he bring into the field?" He once saw a crowd staring at something on a wall. He rode up and found that the object of curiosity was a scurrilous placard against himself. The placard had been posted up so high that it was not easy to read it. Frederic ordered his attendants to take it down and put it lower. "My people and I," he said, "have come to an agreement which satisfies us both. They are to say what they please, and I am to do what I please." No person would have dared to publish in London satires on George the Second approaching to the atrocity of those satires on Frederic, which the booksellers at Berlin sold with impunity. One bookseller sent to the palace a copy of the most stinging lampoon that perhaps was ever written in the world, the Memoirs of Voltaire, published by Beaumarchais, and asked for his Majesty's orders. "Do not advertise it in an offensive manner," said the King; "but sell it by all means. I hope it will pay you well." Even among statesmen accustomed to the licence of a free press, such steadfastness of mind as this is not very common. It is due also to the memory of Frederic to say that he earnestly laboured to secure to his people the great blessing of cheap and speedy Justice. He was one of the first rulers who abolished the cruel and absurd practice of torture. No sentence of death, pronounced by the ordinary tribunals, was executed without his sanction; and his sanction, except in cases of murder, was rarely given. Towards his troops he acted in a very different manner. Military offences were punished with such barbarous scourging that to be shot was considered by the Prussian soldier as a secondary punishment. Indeed, the principle which pervaded Frederic's whole policy was this, that the more severely the army is governed, the safer it is to treat the rest of the community with lenity. Religious persecution was unknown under his government, unless some foolish and unjust restrictions which lay upon the Jews may be regarded as forming an exception. His policy with respect to the Catholics of Silesia presented an honourable contrast to the policy which, under very similar circumstances, England long followed with respect to the Catholics of Ireland. Every form of religion and irreligion found an asylum in the States. The scoffer whom the parliaments of France had sentenced to a cruel death, was consoled by a commission in the Prussian service. The Jesuit who could show his face nowhere else, who in Britain was still subject to penal laws, who was proscribed by France, Spain, Portugal, and Naples, who had been given up even by the Vatican, found safety and the means of subsistence in the Prussian dominions. Most of the vices of Frederic's administration resolve selves into one vice, the spirit of meddling. The indefatigable activity of his intellect, his dictatorial temper, his military habits, all inclined him to this great fault. He drilled his people as he drilled his grenadiers. Capital and industry were diverted from their natural direction by a crowd of preposterous regulations. There was a monopoly of coffee, a monopoly of tobacco, a monopoly of refined sugar. The public money, of which the King was generally so sparing, was lavishly spent in ploughing bogs, in planting mulberry trees amidst the sand, in bringing sheep from Spain to improve the Saxon wool, in bestowing prizes for fine yarn, in building manufactories of porcelain, manufactories of carpets, manufactories of hardware, manufactories of lace. Neither the experience of other rulers, nor his own, could ever teach him that something more than an edict and a grant of public money was required to create a Lyons, a Brussels, or a Birmingham. For his commercial policy, however, there was some excuse. He had on his side illustrious examples and popular prejudice. Grievously as he erred, he erred in company with his age. In other departments his meddling was altogether without apology. He interfered with the course of justice as well as with the course of trade; and set up his own crude notions of equity against the law as expounded by the unanimous voice of the gravest magistrates. It never occurred to him that men whose lives were passed in adjudicating on questions of civil right were more likely to form correct opinions on such questions than a prince whose attention was divided among a thousand objects, and who had never read a law-book through. The resistance opposed to him by the tribunals inflamed him to fury. He reviled his Chancellor. He kicked the shins of his judges. He did not, it is true, intend to act unjustly. He firmly believed that he was doing right, and defending the cause of the poor against the wealthy. Yet this well-meant meddling probably did far more harm than all the explosions of his evil passions during the whole of his long reign. We could make shift to live under a debauchee or a tyrant; but to be ruled by a busybody is more than human nature can bear. The same passion for directing and regulating appeared in every part of the King's policy. Every lad of a certain station in life was forced to go to certain schools within the Prussian dominions. If a young Prussian repaired, though but for a few weeks, to Leyden or Gottingen for the purpose of study, the offence was punished with civil disabilities, and sometimes with the confiscation of property. Nobody was to travel without the royal permission. If the permission were granted, the pocket- money of the tourist was fixed by royal ordinance. A merchant might take with him two hundred and fifty rixdollars in gold, a noble was allowed to take four hundred; for it may be observed, in passing, that Frederic studiously kept up the old distinction between the nobles and the community. In speculation, he was a French philosopher, but in action, a German prince. He talked and wrote about the privileges of blood in the style of Sieyes; but in practice no chapter in the empire looked with a keener eye to genealogies and quarterings. Such was Frederic the Ruler. But there was another Frederic, the Frederic of Rheinsberg, the fiddler and flute-player, the poetaster and metaphysician. Amidst the cares of State the King had retained his passion for music, for reading, for writing, for literary society. To these amusements he devoted all the time that he could snatch from the business of war and government; and perhaps more light is thrown on his character by what passed during his hours of relaxation, than by his battles or his laws. It was the just boast of Schiller that, in his country, no Augustus, no Lorenzo, had watched over the infancy of poetry. The rich and energetic language of Luther, driven by the Latin from the schools of pedants, and by the French from the palaces of kings, had taken refuge among the people. Of the powers of that language Frederic had no notion. He generally spoke of it, and of those who used it, with the contempt of ignorance. His library consisted of French books; at his table nothing was heard but French conversation. The associates of his hours of relaxation were, for the most part, foreigners. Britain furnished to the royal circle two distinguished men, born in the highest rank, and driven by civil dissensions from the land to which, under happier circumstances, their talents and virtues might have been a source of strength and glory. George Keith, Earl Marischal of Scotland, had taken arms for the House of Stuart in 1715; and his younger brother James, then only seventeen years old, had fought gallantly by his side. When all was lost they retired together to the Continent, roved from country to country, served under various standards, and so bore themselves as to win the respect and good-will of many who had no love for the Jacobite cause. Their long wanderings terminated at Potsdam; nor had Frederic any associates who deserved or obtained so large a share of his esteem. They were not only accomplished men, but nobles and warriors, capable of serving him in war and diplomacy, as well as of amusing him at supper. Alone of all his companions, they appear never to have had reason to complain of his demeanour towards them. Some of those who knew the palace best pronounced that the Lord Marischal was the only human being whom Frederic ever really loved. Italy sent to the parties at Potsdam the ingenious and amiable Algarotti, and Bastiani, the most crafty, cautious, and servile of Abbes. But the greater part of the society which Frederic had assembled round him, was drawn from France. Maupertuis had acquired some celebrity by the journey which he had made to Lapland, for the purpose of ascertaining, by actual measurement, the shape of our planet. He was placed in the chair of the Academy of Berlin, a humble imitation of the renowned academy of Paris. Baculard D'Arnaud, a young poet, who was thought to have given promise of great things, had been induced to quit his country, and to reside at the Prussian Court. The Marquess D'Argens was among the King's favourite companions, on account, as it should seem, of the strong opposition between their characters. The parts of D'Argens were good, and his manners those of a finished French gentleman; but his whole soul was dissolved in sloth, timidity, and self-indulgence. He was one of that abject class of minds which are superstitious without being religious. Hating Christianity with a rancour which made him incapable of rational inquiry, unable to see in the harmony and beauty of the universe the traces of divine power and wisdom, he was the slave of dreams and omens, would not sit down to table with thirteen in company, turned pale if the salt fell towards him, begged his guests not to cross their knives and forks on their plates, and would not for the world commence a journey on Friday. His health was a subject of constant anxiety to him. Whenever his head ached, or his pulse beat quick, his dastardly fears and effeminate precautions were the jest of all Berlin. All this suited the King's purpose admirably. He wanted somebody by whom he might be amused, and whom he might despise. When he wished to pass half an hour in easy polished conversation, D'Argens was an excellent companion; when he wanted to vent his spleen and contempt, D'Argens was an excellent butt. With these associates, and others of the same class, Frederic loved to spend the time which he could steal from public cares. He wished his supper parties to be gay and easy. He invited his guests to lay aside all restraint, and to forget that he was at the head of a hundred and sixty thousand soldiers, and was absolute master of the life and liberty of ail who sat at meat with him. There was, therefore, at these parties the outward show of ease. The wit and learning of the company were ostentatiously displayed. The discussions on history and literature were often highly interesting. But the absurdity of all the religions known among men was the chief topic of conversation; and the audacity with which doctrines and names venerated throughout Christendom were treated on these occasions startled even persons accustomed to the society of French and English freethinkers. Real liberty, however, or real affection, was in this brilliant society not to be found. Absolute kings seldom have friends: and Frederic's faults were such as, even where perfect equality exists, make friendship exceedingly precarious. He had indeed many qualities which, on a first acquaintance were captivating. His conversation was lively; his manners, to those whom he desired to please, were even caressing. No man could flatter with more delicacy. No man succeeded more completely in inspiring those who approached him with vague hopes of some great advantage from his kindness. But under this fair exterior he was a tyrant, suspicious, disdainful, and malevolent. He had one taste which may be pardoned in a boy, but which, when habitually and deliberately indulged by a man of mature age and strong understanding, is almost invariably the sign of a bad heart--a taste for severe practical jokes. If a courtier was fond of dress, oil was flung over his richest suit. If he was fond of money, some prank was invented to make him disburse more than he could spare. If he was hypochondriacal, he was made to believe that he had the dropsy. If he had particularly set his heart on visiting a place, a letter was forged to frighten him from going thither. These things, it may be said, are trifles. They are so; but they are indications, not to be mistaken, of a nature to which the sight of human suffering and human degradation is an agreeable excitement. Frederic had a keen eye for the foibles of others, and loved to communicate his discoveries. He had some talent for sarcasm, and considerable skill in detecting the sore places where sarcasm would be most acutely felt. His vanity, as well as his malignity, found gratification in the vexation and confusion of those who smarted under his caustic jests. Yet in truth his success on these occasions belonged quite as much to the king as to the wit. We read that Commodus descended, sword in hand, into the arena, against a wretched gladiator, armed only with a foil of lead, and, after shedding the blood of the helpless victim, struck medals to commemorate the inglorious victory. The triumphs of Frederic in the war of repartee were of much the same kind. How to deal with him was the most puzzling of questions. To appear constrained in his presence was to disobey his commands, and to spoil his amusement. Yet if his associates were enticed by his graciousness to indulge in the familiarity of a cordial intimacy, he was certain to make them repent of their presumption by some cruel humiliation. To resent his affronts was perilous; yet not to resent them was to deserve and to invite them. In his view, those who mutinied were insolent and ungrateful; those who submitted were curs made to receive bones and kickings with the same fawning patience. It is, indeed, difficult to conceive how anything short of the rage of hunger should have induced men to bear the misery of being the associates of the Great King. It was no lucrative post. His Majesty was as severe and economical in his friendships as in the other charges of his establishment, and as unlikely to give a rixdollar too much for his guests as for his dinners. The sum which he allowed to a poet or a philosopher was the very smallest sum for which such poet or philosopher could be induced to sell himself into slavery; and the bondsman might think himself fortunate, if what had been so grudgingly given was not, after years of suffering, rudely and arbitrarily withdrawn. Potsdam was, in truth, what it was called by one of its most illustrious inmates, the Palace of Alcina, At the first glance it seemed to be a delightful spot, where every intellectual and physical enjoyment awaited the happy adventurer. Every newcomer was received with eager hospitality, intoxicated with flattery, encouraged to expect prosperity and greatness. It was in vain that a long succession of favourites who had entered that abode with delight and hope, and who, after a short term of delusive happiness, had been doomed to expiate their folly by years of wretchedness and degradation, raised their voices to warn the aspirant who approached the charmed threshold. Some had wisdom enough to discover the truth early, and spirit enough to fly without looking back; others lingered on to a cheerless and unhonoured old age. We have no hesitation in saying that the poorest author of that time in London, sleeping on a bulk, dining in a cellar, with a cravat of paper, and a skewer for a shirt- pin, was a happier man than any of the literary inmates of Frederic's Court. But of all who entered the enchanted garden in the inebriation of delight, and quitted it in agonies of rage and shame, the most remarkable was Voltaire. Many circumstances had made him desirous of finding a home at a distance from his country. His fame had raised him up enemies. His sensibility gave them a formidable advantage over him. They were, indeed, contemptible assailants. Of all that they wrote against him, nothing has survived except what he has himself preserved. But the constitution of his mind resembled the constitution of those bodies in which the slightest scratch of a bramble, or the bite of a gnat, never fails to fester. Though his reputation was rather raised than lowered by the abuse of such writers as Freron and Desfontaines, though the vengeance which he took on Freron and Desfontaines was such, that scourging, branding, pillorying, would have been a trifle to it, there is reason to believe that they gave him far more pain than he ever gave them. Though he enjoyed during his own lifetime the reputation of a classic, though he was extolled by his contemporaries above all poets, philosophers, and historians, though his works were read with as much delight and admiration at Moscow and Westminster, at Florence and Stockholm, as at Paris itself, he was yet tormented by that restless jealousy which should seem to belong only to minds burning with the desire of fame, and yet conscious of impotence. To men of letters who could by no possibility be his rivals, he was, if they behaved well to him, not merely just, not merely courteous, but often a hearty friend and a munificent benefactor. But to every writer who rose to a celebrity approaching his own, he became either a disguised or an avowed enemy. He slily depreciated Montesquieu and Buffon. He publicly, and with violent outrage, made war on Rousseau. Nor had he the heart of hiding his feelings under the semblance of good humour or of contempt. With all his great talents, and all his long experience of the world, he had no more self-command than a petted child, or a hysterical woman. Whenever he was mortified, he exhausted the whole rhetoric of anger and sorrow to express his mortification. His torrents of bitter words, his stamping and cursing, his grimaces and his tears of rage, were a rich feast to those abject natures, whose delight is in the agonies of powerful spirits and in the abasement of immortal names. These creatures had now found out a way of galling him to the very quick. In one walk, at least, it had been admitted by envy itself that he was without a living competitor. Since Racine had been laid among the great men whose dust made the holy precinct of Port-Royal holier, no tragic poet had appeared who could contest the palm with the author of Zaire, of Alzire, and of Merope. At length a rival was announced. Old Crebillon, who, many years before, had obtained some theatrical success, and who had long been forgotten, came forth from his garret in one of the meanest lanes near the Rue St. Antoine, and was welcomed by the acclamations of envious men of letters, and of a capricious populace. A thing called Catiline, which he had written in his retirement, was acted with boundless applause. Of this execrable piece it is sufficient to say, that the plot turns on a love affair, carried on in all the forms of Scudery, between Catiline, whose confidant is the Praetor Lentulus, and Tullia, the daughter of Cicero. The theatre resounded with acclamations. The King pensioned the successful poet; and the coffee-houses pronounced that Voltaire was a clever man, but that the real tragic inspiration, the celestial fire which had glowed in Corneille and Racine, was to be found in Crebillon alone. The blow went to Voltaire's heart. Had his wisdom and fortitude been in proportion to the fertility of his intellect, and to the brilliancy of his wit, he would have seen that it was out of the power of all the puffers and detractors in Europe to put Catiline above Zaire; but he had none of the magnanimous patience with which Milton and Bentley left their claims to the unerring judgment of time. He eagerly engaged in an undignified competition with Crebillon, and produced a series of plays on the same subjects which his rival had treated. These pieces were coolly received. Angry with the court, angry with the capital, Voltaire began to find pleasure in the prospect of exile. His attachment for Madame du Chatelet long prevented him from executing his purpose. Her death set him at liberty; and he determined to take refuge at Berlin. To Berlin he was invited by a series of letters, couched in terms of the most enthusiastic friendship and admiration. For once the rigid parsimony of Frederic seemed to have relaxed. Orders, honourable offices, a liberal pension, a well-served table, stately apartments under a royal roof, were offered in return for the pleasure and honour which were expected from the society of the first wit of the age. A thousand louis were remitted for the charges of the journey. No ambassador setting out from Berlin for a court of the first rank, had ever been more amply supplied. But Voltaire was not satisfied. At a later period, when he possessed an ample fortune, he was one of the most liberal of men; but till his means had become equal to his wishes, his greediness for lucre was unrestrained either by justice or by shame. He had the effrontery to ask for a thousand louis more, in order to enable him to bring his niece, Madame Denis, the ugliest of coquettes, in his company. The indelicate rapacity of the poet produced its natural effect on the severe and frugal King. The answer was a dry refusal. "I did not," said his Majesty, "solicit the honour of the lady's society." On this, Voltaire went off into a paroxysm of childish rage. "Was there ever such avarice? He has hundreds of tubs full of dollars in his vaults, and haggles with me about a poor thousand louis." It seemed that the negotiation would be broken off; but Frederic, with great dexterity, affected indifference, and seemed inclined to transfer his idolatry to Baculard D'Arnaud. His Majesty even wrote some bad verses, of which the sense was, that Voltaire was a setting sun, and that D'Arnaud was rising. Good-natured friends soon carried the lines to Voltaire. He was in his bed. He jumped out in his shirt, danced about the room with rage, and sent for his passport and his post-horses. It was not difficult to foresee the end of a connection which had such a beginning. It was in the year 1750 that Voltaire left the great capital, which he was not to see again till, after the lapse of near thirty years, he returned bowed down by extreme old age, to die in the midst of a splendid and ghastly triumph. His reception in Prussia was such as might well have elated a less vain and excitable mind. He wrote to his friends at Paris, that the kindness and the attention with which he had been welcomed surpassed description, that the King was the most amiable of men, that Potsdam was the paradise of philosophers. He was created chamberlain, and received, together with his gold key, the cross of an order, and a patent ensuring to him a pension of eight hundred pounds sterling a year for life. A hundred and sixty pounds a year were promised to his niece if she survived him. The royal cooks and coachmen were put at his disposal. He was lodged in the same apartments in which Saxe had lived, when, at the height of power and glory, he visited Prussia. Frederic, indeed, stooped for a time even to use the language of adulation. He pressed to his lips the meagre hand of the little grinning skeleton, whom he regarded as the dispenser of immortal renown. He would add, he said, to the titles which he owed to his ancestors and his sword, another title, derived from his last and proudest acquisition. His style should run thus: Frederic, King of Prussia, Margrave of Brandenburg, Sovereign Duke of Silesia, Possessor of Voltaire. But even amidst the delights of the honeymoon, Voltaire's sensitive vanity began to take alarm. A few days after his arrival, he could not help telling his niece that the amiable King had a trick of giving a sly scratch with one hand while patting and stroking with the other. Soon came hints not the less alarming, because mysterious. "The supper parties are delicious. The King is the life of the company. But--I have operas and comedies, reviews and concerts, my studies and books. But--but--Berlin is fine, the princesses charming, the maids of honour handsome. But--" This eccentric friendship was fast cooling. Never had there met two persons so exquisitely fitted to plague each other. Each of them had exactly the fault of which the other was most impatient; and they were, in different ways, the most impatient of mankind. Frederic was frugal, almost niggardly. When he had secured his plaything he began to think that he had bought it too dear. Voltaire, on the other hand, was greedy, even to the extent of imprudence and knavery; and conceived that the favourite of a monarch who had barrels full of gold and silver laid up in cellars ought to make a fortune which a receiver-general might envy. They soon discovered each other's feelings. Both were angry; and a war began, in which Frederic stooped to the part of Harpagon, and Voltaire to that of Scapin. It is humiliating to relate, that the great warrior and statesman gave orders that his guest's allowance of sugar and chocolate should be curtailed. It is, if possible, a still more humiliating fact, that Voltaire indemnified himself by pocketing the wax candles in the royal antechamber. Disputes about money, however, were not the most serious disputes of these extraordinary associates. The sarcasms of the King soon galled the sensitive temper of the poet. D'Arnaud and D'Argens, Guichard and La Metrie, might, for the sake of a morsel of bread, be willing to bear the insolence of a master; but Voltaire was of another order. He knew that he was a potentate as well as Frederic, that his European reputation, and his incomparable power of covering whatever he hated with ridicule, made him an object of dread even to the leaders of armies and the rulers of nations. In truth, of all the intellectual weapons which have ever been wielded by man, the most terrible was the mockery of Voltaire. Bigots and tyrants, who had never been moved by the wailing and cursing of millions, turned pale at his name. Principles unassailable by reason, principles which had withstood the fiercest attacks of power, the most valuable truths, the most generous sentiments, the noblest and most graceful images, the purest reputations, the most august institutions, began to look mean and loathsome as soon as that withering smile was turned upon them. To every opponent, however strong in his cause and his talents, in his station and his character, who ventured to encounter the great scoffer, might be addressed the caution which was given of old to the Archangel:              "I forewarn thee, shun His deadly arrow: neither vainly hope To be invulnerable in those bright arms, Though temper'd heavenly; for that fatal dint, Save Him who reigns above, none can resist." We cannot pause to recount how often that rare talent was exercised against rivals worthy of esteem; how often it was used to crush and torture enemies worthy only of silent disdain; how often it was perverted to the more noxious purpose of destroying the last solace of earthly misery, and the last restraint on earthly power. Neither can we pause to tell how often it was used to vindicate justice, humanity, and toleration, the principles of sound philosophy, the principles of free government. This is not the place for a full character of Voltaire. Causes of quarrel multiplied fast. Voltaire, who, partly from love of money, and partly from love of excitement, was always fond of stock-jobbing, became implicated in transactions of at least a dubious character. The King was delighted at having such an opportunity to humble his guest; and bitter reproaches and complaints were exchanged. Voltaire, too, was soon at war with the other men of letters who surrounded the King; and this irritated Frederic, who, however, had himself chiefly to blame: for, from that love of tormenting which was in him a ruling passion, he perpetually lavished extravagant praises on small men and bad books, merely in order that he might enjoy the mortification and rage which on such occasions Voltaire took no pains to conceal. His Majesty, however, soon had reason to regret the pains which he had taken to kindle jealousy among the members of his household. The whole palace was in a ferment with literary intrigues and cabals. It was to no purpose that the imperial voice, which kept a hundred and sixty thousand soldiers in order, was raised to quiet the contention of the exasperated wits. It was far easier to stir up such a storm than to lull it. Nor was Frederic, in his capacity of wit, by any means without his own share of vexations. He had sent a large quantity of verses to Voltaire, and requested that they might be returned, with remarks and corrections. "See," exclaimed Voltaire, "what a quantity of his dirty linen the King has sent me to wash!" Talebearers were not wanting to carry the sarcasm to the royal ear; and Frederic was as much incensed as a Grub Street writer who had found his name in the Dunciad. This could not last. A circumstance which, when the mutual regard of the friends was in its first glow, would merely have been matter for laughter, produced a violent explosion. Maupertuis enjoyed as much of Frederic's goodwill as any man of letters. He was President of the Academy of Berlin; and he stood second to Voltaire, though at an immense distance, in the literary society which had been assembled at the Prussian Court. Frederic had, by playing for his own amusement on the feelings of the two jealous and vainglorious Frenchmen, succeeded in producing a bitter enmity between them. Voltaire resolved to set his mark, a mark never to be effaced, on the forehead of Maupertuis, and wrote the exquisitely ludicrous Diatribe of Doctor Akakia. He showed this little piece to Frederic, who had too much taste and too much malice not to relish such delicious pleasantry. In truth, even at this time of day, it is not easy for any person who has the least perception of the ridiculous to read the jokes on the Latin city, the Patagonians, and the hole to the centre of the earth, without laughing till he cries. But though Frederic was diverted by this charming pasquinade, he was unwilling that it should get abroad. His self-love was interested. He had selected Maupertuis to fill the chair of his Academy. If all Europe were taught to laugh at Maupertuis, would not the reputation of the Academy, would not even the dignity of its royal patron, be in some degree compromised? The King, therefore, begged Voltaire to suppress this performance. Voltaire promised to do so, and broke his word. The Diatribe was published, and received with shouts of merriment and applause by all who could read the French language. The King stormed. Voltaire, with his usual disregard of truth, asserted his innocence, and made up some lie about a printer or an amanuensis. The King was not to be so imposed upon. He ordered the pamphlet to be burned by the common hangman, and insisted upon having an apology from Voltaire, couched in the most abject terms. Voltaire sent back to the King his cross, his key, and the patent of his pension. After this burst of rage, the strange pair began to be ashamed of their violence, and went through the forms of reconciliation. But the breach was irreparable; and Voltaire took his leave of Frederic for ever. They parted with cold civility; but their hearts were big with resentment. Voltaire had in his keeping a volume of the King's poetry, and forgot to return it. This was, we believe, merely one of the oversights which men setting out upon a journey often commit. That Voltaire could have meditated plagiarism is quite incredible. He would not, we are confident, for the half of Frederic's kingdom, have consented to father Frederic's verses. The King, however, who rated his own writings much above their value, and who was inclined to see all Voltaire's actions in the worst light, was enraged to think that his favourite compositions were in the hands of an enemy, as thievish as a daw and as mischievous as a monkey. In the anger excited by this thought, he lost sight of reason and decency, and determined on committing an outrage at once odious and ridiculous. Voltaire had reached Frankfort. His niece, Madame Denis, came thither to meet him. He conceived himself secure from the power of his late master, when he was arrested by order of the Prussian resident. The precious volume was delivered up. But the Prussian agents had, no doubt, been instructed not to let Voltaire escape without some gross indignity. He was confined twelve days in a wretched hovel. Sentinels with fixed bayonets kept guard over him. His niece was dragged through the mire by the soldiers. Sixteen hundred dollars were extorted from him by his insolent gaolers. It is absurd to say that this outrage is not to be attributed to the King. Was anybody punished for it? Was anybody called in question for it? Was it not consistent with Frederic's character? Was it not of a piece with his conduct on other similar occasions? Is it not notorious that he repeatedly gave private directions to his officers to pillage and demolish the houses of persons against whom he had a grudge, charging them at the same time to take their measures in such a way that his name might not be compromised? He acted thus towards Count Bruhl in the Seven Years' War. Why should we believe that he would have been more scrupulous with regard to Voltaire? When at length the illustrious prisoner regained his liberty, the prospect before him was but dreary. He was an exile both from the country of his birth and from the country of his adoption. The French Government had taken offence at his journey to Prussia, and would not permit him to return to Paris; and in the vicinity of Prussia it was not safe for him to remain. He took refuge on the beautiful shores of Lake Leman. There, loosed from every tie which had hitherto restrained him, and having little to hope, or to fear from courts and churches, he began his long war against all that, whether for good or evil, had authority over man; for what Burke said of the Constituent Assembly, was eminently true of this its great forerunner: Voltaire could not build: he could only pull down: he was the very Vitruvius of ruin. He has bequeathed to us not a single doctrine to be called by his name, not a single addition to the stock of our positive knowledge. But no human teacher ever left behind him so vast and terrible a wreck of truths and falsehoods, of things noble and things base, of things useful and things pernicious. From the time when his sojourn beneath the Alps commenced, the dramatist, the wit, the historian, was merged in a more important character. He was now the patriarch, the founder of a sect, the chief of a conspiracy, the prince of a wide intellectual commonwealth. He often enjoyed a pleasure dear to the better part of his nature, the pleasure of vindicating innocence which had no other helper, of repairing cruel wrongs, of punishing tyranny in high places. He had also the satisfaction, not less acceptable to his ravenous vanity, of hearing terrified Capuchins call him the Antichrist. But whether employed in works of benevolence, or in works of mischief, he never forgot Potsdam and Frankfort; and he listened anxiously to every murmur which indicated that a tempest was gathering in Europe, and that his vengeance was at hand. He soon had his wish. Maria Theresa had never for a moment forgotten the great wrong which she had received at the hand of Frederic. Young and delicate, just left an orphan, just about to be a mother, she had been compelled to fly from the ancient capital of her race; she had seen her fair inheritance dismembered by robbers, and of those robbers he had been the foremost. Without a pretext, without a provocation, in defiance of the most sacred engagements, he had attacked the helpless ally whom he was bound to defend. The Empress Queen had the faults as well as the virtues which are connected with quick sensibility and a high spirit. There was no peril which she was not ready to brave, no calamity which she was not ready to bring on her subjects, or on the whole human race, if only she might once taste the sweetness of a complete revenge. Revenge, too, presented itself, to her narrow and superstitious mind, in the guise of duty. Silesia had been wrested not only from the House of Austria, but from the Church of Rome. The conqueror had indeed permitted his new subjects to worship God after their own fashion; but this was not enough. To bigotry it seemed an intolerable hardship that the Catholic Church, having long enjoyed ascendency, should be compelled to content itself with equality. Nor was this the only circumstance which led Maria Theresa to regard her enemy as the enemy of God. The profaneness of Frederic's writings and conversation, and the frightful rumours which were circulated respecting the immorality of his private life, naturally shocked a woman who believed with the firmest faith all that her confessor told her, and who, though surrounded by temptations, though young and beautiful, though ardent in all her passions, though possessed of absolute power, had preserved her fame unsullied even by the breath of slander. To recover Silesia, to humble the dynasty of Hohenzollern to the dust, was the great object of her life. She toiled during many years for this end, with zeal as indefatigable as that which the poet ascribed to the stately goddess who tired out her immortal horses in the work of raising the nations against Troy, and who offered to give up to destruction her darling Sparta and Mycenae, if only she might once see the smoke going up from the palace of Priam. With even such a spirit did the proud Austrian Juno strive to array against her foe a coalition such as Europe had never seen. Nothing would content her but that the whole civilised world, from the White Sea to the Adriatic, from the Bay of Biscay to the pastures of the wild horses of the Tanais, should be combined in arms against one petty State. She early succeeded by various arts in obtaining the adhesion of Russia. An ample share of spoil was promised to the King of Poland; and that prince, governed by his favourite, Count Bruhl, readily promised the assistance of the Saxon forces. The great difficulty was with France. That the Houses of Bourbon and of Hapsburg should ever cordially co-operate in any great scheme of European policy, had long been thought, to use the strong expression of Frederic, just as impossible as that fire and water should amalgamate. The whole history of the Continent, during two centuries and a half, had been the history of the mutual jealousies and enmities of France and Austria. Since the administration of Richelieu, above all, it had been considered as the plain policy of the Most Christian King to thwart on all occasions the Court of Vienna, and to protect every member of the Germanic body who stood up against the dictation of the Caesars. Common sentiments of religion had been unable to mitigate this strong antipathy. The rulers of France, even while clothed in the Roman purple, even persecuting the heretics of Rochelle and Auvergne, had still looked with favour on the Lutheran and Calvinistic princes who were struggling against the chief of the empire. If the French ministers paid any respect to the traditional rules handed down to them through many generations, they would have acted towards Frederic as the greatest of their predecessors acted towards Gustavus Adolphus. That there was deadly enmity between Prussia and Austria was of itself a sufficient reason for close friendship between Prussia and France. With France Frederic could never have any serious controversy. His territories were so situated that his ambition, greedy and unscrupulous as it was, could never impel him to attack her of his own accord. He was more than half a Frenchman: he wrote, spoke, read nothing but French: he delighted in French society: the admiration of the French he proposed to himself as the best reward of all his exploits. It seemed incredible that any French Government, however notorious for levity or stupidity, could spurn away such an ally. The Court of Vienna, however, did not despair. The Austrian diplomatists propounded a new scheme of politics, which, it must be owned, was not altogether without plausibility. The great powers, according to this theory, had long been under a delusion. They had looked on each other as natural enemies, while in truth they were natural allies. A succession of cruel wars had devastated Europe, had thinned the population, had exhausted the public resources, had loaded governments with an immense burden of debt; and when, after two hundred years of murderous hostility or of hollow truce, the illustrious Houses whose enmity had distracted the world sat down to count their gains, to what did the real advantage on either side amount? Simply to this, that they had kept each other from thriving. It was not the King of France, it was not the Emperor, who had reaped the fruits of the Thirty Years' War, or of the War of the Pragmatic Sanction. Those fruits had been pilfered by states of the second and third rank, which, secured against jealousy by their insignificance, had dexterously aggrandised themselves while pretending to serve the animosity of the great chiefs of Christendom. While the lion and tiger were tearing each other, the jackal had run off into the jungle with the prey. The real gainer by the Thirty Years' War had been neither France nor Austria, but Sweden. The real gainer by the War of the Pragmatic Sanction had been neither France nor Austria, but the upstart of Brandenburg. France had made great efforts, had added largely to her military glory, and largely to her public burdens; and for what end? Merely that Frederic might rule Silesia. For this and this alone one French army, wasted by sword and famine, had perished in Bohemia; and another had purchased with flood of the noblest blood, the barren glory of Fontenoy. And this prince, for whom France had suffered so much, was he a grateful, was he even an honest ally? Had he not been as false to the Court of Versailles as to the Court of Vienna? Had he not played, on a large scale, the same part which, in private life, is played by the vile agent of chicane who sets his neighbours quarrelling, involves them in costly and interminable litigation, and betrays them to each other all round, certain that, whoever may be ruined, he shall be enriched? Surely the true wisdom of the great powers was to attack, not each other, but this common barrator, who, by inflaming the passions of both, by pretending to serve both, and by deserting both, had raised himself above the station to which he was born. The great object of Austria was to regain Silesia; the great object of France was to obtain an accession of territory on the side of Flanders. If they took opposite sides, the result would probably be that, after a war of many years, after the slaughter of many thousands of brave men, after the waste of many millions of crowns, they would lay down their arms without having achieved either object; but, if they came to an understanding, there would be no risk, and no difficulty. Austria would willingly make in Belgium such cessions as France could not expect to obtain by ten pitched battles. Silesia would easily be annexed to the monarchy of which it had long been a part. The union of two such powerful governments would at once overawe the King of Prussia. If he resisted, one short campaign would settle his fate. France and Austria, long accustomed to rise from the game of war both losers, would, for the first time, both be gainers. There could be no room for jealousy between them. The power of both would be increased at once; the equilibrium between them would be preserved; and the only sufferer would be a mischievous and unprincipled buccaneer, who deserved no tenderness from either. These doctrines, attractive from their novelty and ingenuity, soon became fashionable at the supper-parties and in the coffee- houses of Paris, and were espoused by every gay marquis and every facetious abbe who was admitted to see Madame de Pompadour's hair curled and powdered. It was not, however, to any political theory that the strange coalition between France and Austria owed its origin. The real motive which induced the great continental powers to forget their old animosities and their old state maxims was personal aversion to the King of Prussia. This feeling was strongest in Maria Theresa; but it was by no means confined to her. Frederic, in some respects a good master, was emphatically a bad neighbour. That he was hard in all dealings, and quick to take all advantages, was not his most odious fault. His bitter and scoffing speech had inflicted keener wounds than his ambition. In his character of wit he was under less restraint than even in his character of ruler. Satirical verses against all the princes and ministers of Europe were ascribed to his pen. In his letters and conversation he alluded to the greatest potentates of the age in terms which would have better suited Colle, in a war of repartee with young Crebillon at Pelletier's table, than a great sovereign speaking of great sovereigns. About women he was in the habit of expressing himself in a manner which it was impossible for the meekest of women to forgive; and, unfortunately for him, almost the whole Continent was then governed by women who were by no means conspicuous for meekness. Maria Theresa herself had not escaped his scurrilous jests. The Empress Elizabeth of Russia knew that her gallantries afforded him a favourite theme for ribaldry and invective. Madame de Pompadour, who was really the head of the French Government, had been even more keenly galled. She had attempted, by the most delicate flattery, to propitiate the King of Prussia; but her messages had drawn from him only dry and sarcastic replies. The Empress Queen took a very different course. Though the haughtiest of princesses, though the most austere of matrons, she forgot in her thirst for revenge both the dignity of her race and the purity of her character, and condescended to flatter the lowborn and low-minded concubine, who, having acquired influence by prostituting herself, retained it by prostituting others. Maria Theresa actually wrote with her own hand a note, full of expressions of esteem and friendship to her dear cousin, the daughter of the butcher Poisson, the wife of the publican D'Etioles, the kidnapper of young girls for the haram of an old rake, a strange cousin for the descendant of so many Emperors of the West! The mistress was completely gained over, and easily carried her point with Lewis, who had, indeed, wrongs of his own to resent. His feelings were not quick, but contempt, says the Eastern proverb, pierces even through the shell of the tortoise; and neither prudence nor decorum had ever restrained Frederic from expressing his measureless contempt for the sloth, the imbecility, and the baseness of Lewis. France was thus induced to join the coalition; and the example of France determined the conduct of Sweden, then completely subject to French influence. The enemies of Frederic were surely strong enough to attack him openly; but they were desirous to add to all their other advantages the advantage of a surprise. He was not, however, a man to be taken off his guard. He had tools in every Court; and he now received from Vienna, from Dresden, and from Paris, accounts so circumstantial and so consistent, that he could not doubt of his danger. He learnt, that he was to be assailed at once by France, Austria, Russia, Saxony, Sweden, and the Germanic body; that the greater part of his dominions was to be portioned out among his enemies; that France, which from her geographical position could not directly share in his spoils, was to receive an equivalent in the Netherlands; that Austria was to have Silesia, and the Czarina East Prussia; that Augustus of Saxony expected Magdeburg; and that Sweden would be rewarded with part of Pomerania. If these designs succeeded, the House of Brandenburg would at once sink in the European system to a place lower than that of the Duke of Wurtemberg or the Margrave of Baden. And what hope was there that these designs would fail? No such union of the continental powers had been seen for ages. A less formidable confederacy had in a week conquered, all the provinces of Venice, when Venice was at the height, of power, wealth, and glory. A less formidable confederacy had compelled Lewis the Fourteenth to bow down his haughty head to the very earth. A less formidable confederacy has, within our own memory, subjugated a still mightier empire, and abused a still prouder name. Such odds had never been heard of in war. The people whom Frederic ruled were not five millions. The population of the countries which were leagued against him amounted to a hundred millions, The disproportion in wealth was at least equally great. Small communities, actuated by strong sentiments of patriotism or loyalty, have sometimes made head against great monarchies weakened by factions and discontents. But small as was Frederic's kingdom, it probably contained a greater number of disaffected subjects than were to be found in all the states of his enemies. Silesia formed a fourth part of his dominions; and from the Silesians, born under Austrian princes, the utmost that he could expect was apathy. From the Silesian Catholics he could hardly expect anything but resistance. Some states have been enabled, by their geographical position, to defend themselves with advantage against immense force. The sea has repeatedly protected England against the fury of the whole Continent. The Venetian Government, driven from its possessions on the land, could still bid defiance to the confederates of Cambray from the arsenal amidst the lagoons. More than one great and well appointed army, which regarded the shepherds of Switzerland as an easy prey, has perished in the passes of the Alps. Frederic hid no such advantage. The form of his states, their situation, the nature of the ground, all were against him. His long, scattered, straggling territory seemed to have been shaped with an express view to the convenience of invaders, and was protected by no sea, by no chain of hills. Scarcely any corner of it was a week's march from the territory of the enemy. The capital itself, in the event of war, would be constantly exposed to insult. In truth there was hardly a politician or a soldier in Europe who doubted that the conflict would be terminated in a very few days by the prostration of the House of Brandenburg. Nor was Frederic's own opinion very different. He anticipated nothing short of his own ruin, and of the ruin of his family. Yet there was still a chance, a slender chance, of escape. His states had at least the advantage of a central position; his enemies were widely separated from each other, and could not conveniently unite their overwhelming forces on one point. They inhabited different climates, and it was probable that the season of the year which would be best suited to the military operations of one portion of the League, would be unfavourable to those of another portion. The Prussian monarchy, too, was free from some infirmities which were found in empires far more extensive and magnificent. Its effective strength for a desperate struggle was not to be measured merely by the number of square miles or the number of people. In that spare but well-knit and well-exercised body, there was nothing but sinew, and muscle and bone. No public creditors looked for dividends. No distant colonies required defence. No Court, filled with flatterers and mistresses, devoured the pay of fifty battalions. The Prussian army, though far inferior in number to the troops which were about to be opposed to it, was yet strong out of all proportion to the extent of the Prussian dominions. It was also admirably trained and admirably officered, accustomed to obey and accustomed to conquer. The revenue was not only unincumbered by debt, but exceeded the ordinary outlay in time of peace. Alone of all the European princes, Frederic had a treasure laid up for a day of difficulty. Above all, he was one, and his enemies were many. In their camps would certainly be found the jealousy, the dissension, the slackness inseparable from coalitions; on his side was the energy, the unity, the secrecy of a strong dictatorship. To a certain extent the deficiency of military means might be supplied by the resources of military art. Small as the King's army was, when compared with the six hundred thousand men whom the confederates could bring into the field, celerity of movement might in some degree compensate for deficiency of bulk. It was thus just possible that genius, judgment, resolution, and good luck united, might protract the struggle during a campaign or two; and to gain even a month was of importance. It could not be long before the vices which are found in all extensive confederacies would begin to show themselves. Every member of the League would think his own share of the war too large, and his own share of the spoils too small. Complaints and recriminations would abound. The Turk might stir on the Danube; the statesmen of France might discover the error which they had committed in abandoning the fundamental principles of their national policy. Above all, death might rid Prussia of its most formidable enemies. The war was the effect of the personal aversion with which three or four sovereigns regarded Frederic; and the decease of any one of those sovereigns might produce a complete revolution in the state of Europe. In the midst of a horizon generally dark and stormy, Frederic could discern one bright spot. The peace which had been concluded between England and France in 1748, had been in Europe no more than an armistice; and had not even been an armistice in the other quarters of the globe. In India the sovereignty of the Carnatic was disputed between two great Mussulman houses; Fort Saint George had taken one side, Pondicherry the other; and in a series of battles and sieges the troops of Lawrence and Clive had been opposed to those of Dupleix. A struggle less important in its consequences, but not less likely to produce irritation, was carried on between those French and English adventurers, who kidnapped negroes and collected gold dust on the coast of Guinea. But it was in North America that the emulation and mutual aversion of the two nations were most conspicuous. The French attempted to hem in the English colonists by a chain of military posts, extending from the Great Lakes to the mouth of the Mississippi. The English took arms. The wild aboriginal tribes appeared on each side mingled with the Pale-Faces. Battles were fought; forts were stormed; and hideous stories about stakes, scalpings, and death-songs reached Europe, and inflamed that national animosity which the rivalry of ages had produced. The disputes between France and England came to a crisis at the very time when the tempest which had been gathering was about to burst on Prussia. The tastes and interests of Frederic would have led him, if he had been allowed an option, to side with the House of Bourbon. But the folly of the Court of Versailles left him no choice. France became the tool of Austria; and Frederic was forced to become the ally of England. He could not, indeed, expect that a power which covered the sea with its fleets, and which had to make war at once on the Ohio and the Ganges, would be able to spare a large number of troops for operations in Germany. But England, though poor compared with the England of our time, was far richer than any country on the Continent. The amount of her revenue, and the resources which she found in her credit, though they may be thought small by a generation which has seen her raise a hundred and thirty millions in a single year, appeared miraculous to the politicians of that age. A very moderate portion of her wealth, expended by an able and economical prince, in a country where prices were low, would be sufficient to equip and maintain a formidable army. Such was the situation in which Frederic found himself. He saw the whole extent of his peril. He saw that there was still a faint possibility of escape; and, with prudent temerity, he determined to strike the first blow. It was in the month of August 1756, that the great war of the Seven Years commenced. The King demanded of the Empress Queen a distinct explanation of her intentions, and plainly told her that he should consider a refusal as a declaration of war. "I want," he said, "no answer in the style of an oracle." He received an answer at once haughty and evasive. In an instant the rich electorate of Saxony was overflowed by sixty thousand Prussian troops. Augustus with his army occupied a strong position at Pirna. The Queen of Poland was at Dresden. In a few days Pirna was blockaded and Dresden was taken. The first object of Frederic was to obtain possession of the Saxon State papers; for those papers, he well knew, contained ample proofs that, though apparently an aggressor, he was really acting in self-defence. The Queen of Poland, as well acquainted as Frederic with the importance of those documents, had packed them up, had concealed them in her bed-chamber, and was about to send them off to Warsaw, when a Prussian officer made his appearance. In the hope that no soldier would venture to outrage a lady, a queen, a daughter of an emperor, the mother-in-law of a dauphin, she placed herself before the trunk, and at length sat down on it. But all resistance was vain. The papers were carried to Frederic, who found in them, as he expected, abundant evidence of the designs of the coalition. The most important documents were instantly published, and the effect of the publication was great. It was clear that, of whatever sins the King of Prussia might formerly have been guilty, he was now the injured party, and had merely anticipated a blow intended to destroy him. The Saxon camp at Pirna was in the meantime closely invested; but the besieged were not without hopes of succour. A great Austrian army under Marshal Brown was about to pour through the passes which separate Bohemia from Saxony. Frederic left at Pirna a force sufficient to deal with the Saxons, hastened into Bohemia, encountered Brown at Lowositz, and defeated him. This battle decided the fate of Saxony. Augustus and his favourite Bruhl fled to Poland. The whole army of the Electorate capitulated. From that time till the end of the war, Frederic treated Saxony as a part of his dominions, or, rather, he acted towards the Saxons in a manner which may serve to illustrate the whole meaning of that tremendous sentence, "subjectos tanquam suos, viles tanquam alienos." Saxony was as much in his power as Brandenburg; and he had no such interest in the welfare of Saxony as he had in the welfare of Brandenburg. He accordingly levied troops and exacted contributions throughout the enslaved province, with far more rigour than in any part of his own dominions. Seventeen thousand men who had been in the camp at Pirna were half compelled, half persuaded to enlist under their conqueror. Thus, within a few weeks from the commencement of hostilities, one of the confederates had been disarmed, and his weapons were now pointed against the rest. The winter put a stop to military operations. All had hitherto gone well. But the real tug of war was still to come. It was easy to foresee that the year 1757 would be a memorable era in the history of Europe. The King's scheme for the campaign was simple, bold, and judicious. The Duke of Cumberland with an English and Hanoverian array was in Western Germany, and might be able to prevent the French troops from attacking Prussia. The Russians, confined by their snows, would probably not stir till the spring was far advanced. Saxony was prostrated. Sweden could do nothing very important. During a few months Frederic would have to deal with Austria alone. Even thus the odds were against him. But ability and courage have often triumphed against odds still more formidable. Early in 1757 the Prussian army in Saxony began to move. Through four defiles in the mountains they came pouring into Bohemia. Prague was the King's first mark; but the ulterior object was probably Vienna. At Prague lay Marshal Brown with one great army. Daun, the most cautious and fortunate of the Austrian captains, was advancing with another. Frederic determined to overwhelm Brown before Daun should arrive. On the sixth of May was fought, under those walls which, a hundred and thirty years before, had witnessed the victory of the Catholic league and the flight of the unhappy Palatine, a battle more bloody than any which Europe saw during the long interval between Malplaquet and Eylau. The King and Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick were distinguished on that day by their valour and exertions. But the chief glory was with Schwerin. When the Prussian infantry wavered, the stout old marshal snatched the colours from an ensign, and, waving them in the air, led back his regiment to the charge. Thus at seventy-two years of age he fell in the thickest battle, still grasping the standard which bears the black eagle on the field argent. The victory remained with the King; but it had been dearly purchased. Whole columns of his bravest warriors had fallen. He admitted that he had lost eighteen thousand men. Of the enemy, twenty-four thousand had been killed, wounded, or taken. Part of the defeated army was shut up in Prague. Part fled to join the troops which, under the command of Daun, were now close at hand. Frederic determined to play over the same game which had succeeded at Lowositz. He left a large force to besiege Prague, and at the head of thirty thousand men he marched against Daun. The cautious Marshal, though he had a great superiority in numbers, would risk nothing. He occupied at Kolin a position almost impregnable, and awaited the attack of the King. It was the eighteenth of June, a day which, if the Greek superstition still retained its influence, would be held sacred to Nemesis, a day on which the two greatest princes of modern times were taught, by a terrible experience, that neither skill nor valour can fix the inconstancy of fortune. The battle began before noon; and part of the Prussian army maintained the contest till after the midsummer sun had gone down. But at length the King found that his troops, having been repeatedly driven back with frightful carnage, could no longer be led to the charge. He was with difficulty persuaded to quit the field. The officers of his personal staff were under the necessity of expostulating with him, and one of them took the liberty to say, "Does your Majesty mean to storm the batteries alone?" Thirteen thousand of his bravest followers had perished. Nothing remained for him but to retreat in good order, to raise the siege of Prague, and to hurry his army by different routes out of Bohemia. This stroke seemed to be final. Frederic's situation had at best been such, that only an uninterrupted run of good luck could save him, as it seemed, from ruin. And now, almost in the outset of the contest he had met with a check which, even in a war between equal powers, would have been felt as serious. He had owed much to the opinion which all Europe entertained of his army. Since his accession, his soldiers had in many successive battles been victorious over the Austrians. But the glory had departed from his arms. All whom his malevolent sarcasms had wounded, made haste to avenge themselves by scoffing at the scoffer. His soldiers had ceased to confide in his star. In every part of his camp his dispositions were severely criticised. Even in his own family he had detractors. His next brother, William, heir- presumptive, or rather, in truth, heir-apparent to the throne, and great-grandfather of the present King, could not refrain from lamenting his own fate and that of the House of Hohenzollern, once so great and so prosperous, but now, by the rash ambition of its chief, made a by-word to all nations. These complaints, and some blunders which William committed during the retreat from Bohemia, called forth the bitter displeasure of the inexorable King. The prince's heart was broken by the cutting reproaches of his brother; he quitted the army, retired to a country seat, and in a short time died of shame and vexation. It seemed that the King's distress could hardly be increased. Yet at this moment another blow not less terrible than that of Kolin fell upon him. The French under Marshal D'Estrees had invaded Germany. The Duke of Cumberland had given them battle at Hastembeck, and had been defeated. In order to save the Electorate of Hanover from entire subjugation, he had made, at Closter Seven, an arrangement with the French Generals, which left them at liberty to turn their arms against the Prussian dominions. That nothing might be wanting to Frederic's distress, he lost his mother just at this time; and he appears to have felt the loss more than was to be expected from the hardness and severity of his character. In truth, his misfortunes had now cut to the quick. The mocker, the tyrant, the most rigorous, the most imperious, the most cynical of men, was very unhappy. His face was so haggard, and his form so thin, that when on his return from Bohemia he passed through Leipsic, the people hardly knew him again. His sleep was broken; the tears, in spite of himself, often started into his eyes; and the grave began to present itself to his agitated mind as the best refuge from misery and dishonour. His resolution was fixed never to be taken alive, and never to make peace on condition of descending from his place among the powers of Europe. He saw nothing left for him except to die; and he deliberately chose his mode of death. He always carried about with him a sure and speedy poison in a small glass case; and to the few in whom he placed confidence, he made no mystery of his resolution. But we should very imperfectly describe the state of Frederic's mind, if we left out of view the laughable peculiarities which contrasted so singularly with the gravity, energy, and harshness of his character. It is difficult to say whether the tragic or the comic predominated in the strange scene which was then acting. In the midst of all the great King's calamities, his passion for writing indifferent poetry grew stronger and stronger. Enemies all round him, despair in his heart, pills of corrosive sublimate hidden in his clothes, he poured forth hundreds upon hundreds of lines, hateful to gods and men, the insipid dregs of Voltaire's Hippocrene, the faint echo of the lyre of Chaulieu. It is amusing to compare what he did during the last months of 1757, with what he wrote during the same time. It may be doubted whether any equal portion of the life of Hannibal, of Caesar, or of Napoleon, will bear a comparison with that short period, the most brilliant in the history of Prussia and of Frederic. Yet at this very time the scanty leisure of the illustrious warrior was employed in producing odes and epistles, a little better than Cibber's, and a little worse than Hayley's. Here and there a manly sentiment which deserves to be in prose makes its appearance in company with Prometheus and Orpheus, Elysium and Acheron, the Plaintive Philomel, the poppies of Morpheus, and all the other frippery which, like a robe tossed by a proud beauty to her waiting woman, has long been contemptuously abandoned by genius to mediocrity. We hardly know any instance of the strength and weakness of human nature so striking, and so grotesque, as the character of this haughty, vigilant, resolute, sagacious blue-stocking, half Mithridates and half Trissotin, bearing up against a world in arms, with an ounce of poison in one pocket and a quire of bad verses in the other. Frederic had some time before made advances towards a reconciliation with Voltaire; and some civil letters had passed between them. After the battle of Kolin their epistolary intercourse became, at least in seeming, friendly and confidential. We do not know any collection of Letters which throws so much light on the darkest and most intricate parts of human nature, as the correspondence of these strange beings after they had exchanged forgiveness. Both felt that the quarrel had lowered them in the public estimation. They admired each other. They stood in need of each other. The great King wished to be handed down to posterity by the great Writer. The great Writer felt himself exalted by the homage or the great King. Yet the wounds which they had inflicted on each other were too deep to be effaced, or even perfectly healed. Not only did the scars remain; the sore places often festered and bled afresh. The letters consisted for the most part of compliments, thanks, offers of service, assurances of attachment. But if anything brought back to Frederic's recollection the cunning and mischievous pranks by which Voltaire had provoked him, some expression of contempt and displeasure broke forth in the midst of eulogy. It was much worse when anything recalled to the mind of Voltaire the outrages which he and his kinswoman had suffered at Frankfort. All at once his flowing panegyric was turned into invective. "Remember how you behaved to me. For your sake I have lost the favour of my native King. For your sake I am an exile from my country. I loved you. I trusted myself to you. I had no wish but to end my life in your service. And what was my reward? Stripped of all that you had bestowed on me, the key, the order, the pension, I was forced to fly from your territories. I was hunted as if I had been a deserter from your grenadiers. I was arrested, insulted, plundered. My niece was dragged through the mud of Frankfort by your soldiers, as if she had been some wretched follower of your camp. You have great talents. You have good qualities. But you have one odious vice. You delight in the abasement of your fellow-creatures. You have brought disgrace on the name of philosopher. You have given some colour to the slanders of the bigots, who say that no confidence can be placed in the justice or humanity of those who reject the Christian faith." Then the King answers, with less heat but equal severity--"You know that you behaved shamefully in Prussia. It was well for you that you had to deal with a man so indulgent to the infirmities of genius as I am. You richly deserved to see the inside of a dungeon. Your talents are not more widely known than your faithlessness and your malevolence. The grave itself is no asylum from your spite. Maupertuis is dead; but you still go on calumniating and deriding him, as if you had not made him miserable enough while he was living. Let us have no more of this. And, above all, let me hear no more of your niece. I am sick to death of her name. I can bear with your faults for the sake of your merits; but she has not written Mahomet or Merope." An explosion of this kind, it might be supposed, would necessarily put an end to all amicable communication. But it was not so. After every outbreak of ill humour this extraordinary pair became more loving than before, and exchanged compliments and assurances of mutual regard with a wonderful air of sincerity. It may well be supposed that men who wrote thus to each other, were not very guarded in what they said of each other. The English ambassador, Mitchell, who knew that the King of Prussia was constantly writing to Voltaire with the greatest freedom on the most important subjects, was amazed to hear his Majesty designate this highly favoured correspondent as a bad-hearted fellow, the greatest rascal on the face of the earth. And the language which the poet held about the King was not much more respectful. It would probably have puzzled Voltaire himself to say what was his real feeling towards Frederic. It was compounded of all sentiments, from enmity to friendship, and from scorn to admiration; and the proportions in which these elements were mixed, changed every moment. The old patriarch resembled the spoiled child who screams, stamps, cuffs, laughs, kisses, and cuddles within one quarter of an hour. His resentment was not extinguished; yet he was not without sympathy for his old friend. As a Frenchman, he wished success to the arms of his country. As a philosopher, he was anxious for the stability of a throne on which a philosopher sat. He longed both to save and to humble Frederic. There was one way, and only one, in which all his conflicting feelings could at once be gratified. If Frederic were preserved by the interference of France, if it were known that for that interference he was indebted to the mediation of Voltaire, this would indeed be delicious revenge; this would indeed be to heap coals of fire on that haughty head. Nor did the vain and restless poet think it impossible that he might, from his hermitage near the Alps, dictate peace to Europe. D'Estrees had quitted Hanover, and the command of the French army had been intrusted to the Duke of Richelieu, a man whose chief distinction was derived from his success in gallantry. Richelieu was in truth the most eminent of that race of seducers by profession, who furnished Crebillon the younger and La Clos with models for their heroes. In his earlier days the royal house itself had not been secure from his presumptuous love. He was believed to have carried his conquests into the family of Orleans; and some suspected that he was not unconcerned in the mysterious remorse which embittered the last hours of the charming mother of Lewis the Fifteenth. But the Duke was now sixty years old. With a heart deeply corrupted by vice, a head long accustomed to think only on trifles, an impaired constitution, an impaired fortune, and, worst of all, a very red nose, he was entering on a dull, frivolous, and unrespected old age. Without one qualification for military command, except that personal courage which was common between him and the whole nobility of France, he had been placed at the head of the army of Hanover; and in that situation he did his best to repair, by extortion and corruption, the injury which he had done to his property by a life of dissolute profusion. The Duke of Richelieu to the end of his life hated the philosophers as a sect, not for those parts of their system which a good and wise man would have condemned, but for their virtues, for their spirit of free inquiry, and for their hatred of those social abuses of which he was himself the personification. But he, like many of those who thought with him, excepted Voltaire from the list of proscribed writers. He frequently sent flattering letters to Ferney. He did the patriarch the honour to borrow money of him, and even carried this condescending friendship so far as to forget to pay the interest. Voltaire thought that it might be in his power to bring the Duke and the King of Prussia into communication with each other. He wrote earnestly to both; and he so far succeeded that a correspondence between them was commenced. But it was to very different means that Frederic was to owe his deliverance. At the beginning of November, the net seemed to have closed completely round him. The Russians were in the field, and were spreading devastation through his eastern provinces. Silesia was overrun by the Austrians. A great French army was advancing from the west under the command of Marshal Soubise, a prince of the great Armorican house of Rohan. Berlin itself had been taken and plundered by the Croatians. Such was the situation from which Frederic extricated himself, with dazzling glory, in the short space of thirty days. He marched first against Soubise. On the fifth of November the armies met at Rosbach. The French were two to one; but they were ill-disciplined, and their general was a dunce. The tactics of Frederic, and the well-regulated valour of the Prussian troops obtained a complete victory. Seven thousand of the invaders were made prisoners. Their guns, their colours, their baggage, fell into the hands of the conquerors. Those who escaped fled as confusedly as a mob scattered by cavalry. Victorious in the West, the King turned his arms towards Silesia. In that quarter everything seemed to be lost. Breslau had fallen; and Charles of Lorraine, with a mighty power, held the whole province. On the fifth of December, exactly one month after the battle of Rosbach, Frederic, with forty thousand men, and Prince Charles, at the head of not less than sixty thousand, met at Leuthen, hard by Breslau. The King, who was, in general, perhaps too much inclined to consider the common soldier as a mere machine, resorted, on this great day, to means resembling those which Bonaparte afterwards employed with such signal success for the purpose of stimulating military enthusiasm. The principal officers were convoked. Frederic addressed them with great force and pathos; and directed them to speak to their men as he had spoken to them. When the armies were set in battle array, the Prussian troops were in a state of fierce excitement; but their excitement showed itself after the fashion of a grave people. The columns advanced to the attack chanting, to the sound of drums and fifes, the rude hymns of the old Saxon Sternholds. They had never fought so well; nor had the genius of their chief ever been so conspicuous. "That battle," said Napoleon, "was a masterpiece. Of itself it is sufficient to entitle Frederic to a place in the first rank among generals." The victory was complete. Twenty-seven thousand Austrians were killed, wounded, or taken; fifty stand of colours, a hundred guns, four thousand waggons, fell into the hands of the Prussians. Breslau opened its gates; Silesia was reconquered; Charles of Lorraine retired to hide his shame and sorrow at Brussels; and Frederic allowed his troops to take some repose in winter quarters, after a campaign, to the vicissitudes of which it will be difficult to find any parallel in ancient or modern history. The King's fame filled all the world. He had during the last year, maintained a contest, on terms of advantage, against three powers, the weakest of which had more than three times his resources. He had fought four great pitched battles against superior forces. Three of these battles he had gained: and the defeat of Kolin, repaired as it had been, rather raised than lowered his military renown. The victory of Leuthen is, to this day, the proudest on the roll of Prussian fame. Leipsic indeed, and Waterloo, produced consequences more important to mankind. But the glory of Leipsic must be shared by the Prussians with the Austrians and Russians; and at Waterloo the British infantry bore the burden and heat of the day. The victory of Rosbach was, in a military point of view, less honourable than that of Leuthen; for it was gained over an incapable general, and a disorganised army; but the moral effect which it produced was immense. All the preceding triumphs of Frederic had been triumphs over Germans, and could excite no emotions of national pride among the German people. It was impossible that a Hessian or a Hanoverian could feel any patriotic exultation at hearing that Pomeranians had slaughtered Moravians, or that Saxon banners had been hung in the churches of Berlin. Indeed, though the military character of the Germans justly stood high throughout the world, they could boast of no great day which belonged to them as a people; of no Agincourt, of no Bannockburn. Most of their victories had been gained over each other; and their most splendid exploits against foreigners had been achieved under the command of Eugene, who was himself a foreigner. The news of the battle of Rosbach stirred the blood of the whole of the mighty population from the Alps to the Baltic, and from the borders of Courland to those of Lorraine. Westphalia and Lower Saxony had been deluged by a great host of strangers, whose speech was unintelligible, and whose petulant and licentious manners had excited the strongest feelings of disgust and hatred. That great host had been put to flight by a small band of German warriors, led by a prince of German blood on the side of father and mother, and marked by the fair hair and the clear blue eye of Germany. Never since the dissolution of the empire of Charlemagne, had the Teutonic race won such a field against the French. The tidings called forth a general burst of delight and pride from the whole of the great family which spoke the various dialects of the ancient language of Arminius. The fame of Frederic began to supply, in some degree, the place of a common government and of a common capital. It became a rallying point for all true Germans, a subject of mutual congratulation to the Bavarian and the Westphalian, to the citizen of Frankfort, and to the citizen of Nuremberg. Then first it was manifest that the Germans were truly a nation. Then first was discernible that patriotic spirit which, in 1813, achieved the great deliverance of central Europe, and which still guards, and long will guard, against foreign ambition the old freedom of the Rhine. Nor were the effects produced by that celebrated day merely political. The greatest masters of German poetry and eloquence have admitted that, though the great King neither valued nor understood his native language, though he looked on France as the only seat of taste and philosophy, yet, in his own despite, he did much to emancipate the genius of his countrymen from the foreign yoke; and that, in the act of vanquishing Soubise, he was, unintentionally, rousing the spirit which soon began to question the literary precedence of Boileau and Voltaire. So strangely do events confound all the plans of man. A prince who read only French, who wrote only French, who aspired to rank as a French classic, became, quite unconsciously, the means of liberating half the Continent from the dominion of that French criticism of which he was himself, to the end of his life, a slave. Yet even the enthusiasm of Germany in favour of Frederic hardly equalled the enthusiasm of England. The birthday of our ally was celebrated with as much enthusiasm as that of our own sovereign; and at night the streets of London were in a blaze with illuminations. Portraits of the Hero of Rosbach, with his cocked hat and long pigtail, were in every house. An attentive observer will, at this day, find in the parlours of old-fashioned inns, and in the portfolios of print-sellers, twenty portraits of Frederic for one of George the Second. The sign-painters were everywhere employed in touching up Admiral Vernon into the King of Prussia. This enthusiasm was strong among religious people, and especially among the Methodists, who knew that the French and Austrians were Papists, and supposed Frederic to be the Joshua or Gideon of the Reformed Faith. One of Whitfield's hearers, on the day On which thanks for the battle of Leuthen were returned at the Tabernacle, made the following exquisitely ludicrous entry in a diary, part of which has come down to us: "The Lord stirred up the King of Prussia and his soldiers to pray. They kept three fast days, and spent about an hour praying and singing psalms before they engaged the enemy.  O! how good it is to pray and fight!" Some young Englishmen of rank proposed to visit Germany as volunteers, for the purpose of learning the art of war under the greatest of commanders. This last proof of British attachment and admiration, Frederic politely but firmly declined. His camp was no place for amateur students of military science. The Prussian discipline was rigorous even to cruelty. The officers, while in the field, were expected to practise an abstemiousness and self-denial such as was hardly surpassed by the most rigid monastic orders. However noble their birth, however high their rank in the service, they were not permitted to eat from anything better than pewter. It was a high crime even in a count and field-marshal to have a single silver spoon among his baggage. Gay young Englishmen of twenty thousand a year, accustomed to liberty and luxury, would not easily submit to these Spartan restraints. The King could not venture to keep them in order as he kept his own subjects in order. Situated as he was with respect to England, he could not well imprison or shoot refractory Howards and Cavendishes. On the other hand, the example of a few fine gentlemen, attended by chariots and livery servants, eating in plates, and drinking champagne and Tokay, was enough to corrupt his whole army. He thought it best to make a stand at first, and civilly refused to admit such dangerous companions among his troops. The help of England was bestowed in a manner far more useful and more acceptable. An annual subsidy of near seven hundred thousand pounds enabled the King to add probably more than fifty thousand men to his army. Pitt, now at the height of power and popularity, undertook the task of defending Western Germany against France, and asked Frederic only for the loan of a general. The general selected was Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, who had attained high distinction in the Prussian service. He was put at the head of an army, partly English, partly Hanoverian, partly composed of mercenaries hired from the petty princes of the empire. He soon vindicated the choice of the two allied Courts, and proved himself the second general of the age. Frederic passed the winter at Breslau, in reading, writing, and preparing for the next campaign. The havoc which the war had made among his troops was rapidly repaired; and in the spring of 1758 he was again ready for the conflict. Prince Ferdinand kept the French in check. The King in the meantime, after attempting against the Austrians some operations which led to no very important result, marched to encounter the Russians, who, slaying, burning, and wasting wherever they turned, had penetrated into the heart of his realm. He gave them battle at Zorndorf, near Frankfort on the Oder. The fight was long and bloody. Quarter was neither given nor taken; for the Germans and Scythians regarded each other with bitter aversion, and the sight of the ravages committed by the half savage invaders, had incensed the King and his army. The Russians were overthrown with great slaughter; and for a few months no further danger was to be apprehended from the east. A day of thanksgiving was proclaimed by the King, and was celebrated with pride and delight by his people. The rejoicings in England were not less enthusiastic or less sincere. This may be selected as the point of time at which the military glory of Frederic reached the zenith. In the short space of three quarters of a year he had won three great battles over the armies of three mighty and warlike monarchies, France, Austria, and Russia. But it was decreed that the temper of that strong mind should be tried by both extremes of fortune in rapid succession. Close upon this series of triumphs came a series of disasters, such as would have blighted the fame and broken the heart of almost any other commander. Yet Frederic, in the midst of his calamities, was still an object of admiration to his subjects, his allies, and his enemies. Overwhelmed by adversity, sick of life, he still maintained the contest, greater in defeat, in, flight, and in what seemed hopeless ruin, than on the fields of his proudest victories. Having vanquished the Russians, he hastened into Saxony to oppose the troops of the Empress Queen, commanded by Daun, the most cautious, and Laudohn, the most inventive and enterprising of her generals. These two celebrated commanders agreed on a scheme, in which the prudence of the one and the vigour of the other seem to have been happily combined. At dead of night they surprised the King in his, camp at Hochkirchen. His presence of mind saved his troops from destruction; but nothing could save them from defeat and severe loss. Marshal Keith was among the slain. The first roar of the guns roused the noble exile from his rest, and he was instantly in the front of the battle. He received a dangerous wound, but refused to quit the field, and was in the act of rallying his broken troops, when an Austrian bullet terminated his chequered and eventful life. The misfortune was serious. But of all generals Frederic understood best how to repair defeat, and Daun understood least how to improve victory. In a few days the Prussian army was as formidable as before the battle. The prospect was, however, gloomy. An Austrian army under General Harsch had invaded Silesia, and invested the fortress of Neisse. Daun, after his success at Hochkirchen, had written to Harsch in very confident terms:--"Go on with your operations against Neisse. Be quite at ease as to the King. I will give a good account of him." In truth, the position of the Prussians was full of difficulties. Between them and Silesia, lay the victorious army of Daun. It was not easy for them to reach Silesia at all. If they did reach it, they left Saxony exposed to the Austrians. But the vigour and activity of Frederic surmounted every obstacle. He made a circuitous march of extraordinary rapidity, passed Daun, hastened into Silesia, raised the siege of Niesse, and drove Harsch into Bohemia. Daun availed himself of the King's absence to attack Dresden. The Prussians defended it desperately. The inhabitants of that wealthy and polished capital begged in vain for mercy from the garrison within, and from the besiegers without. The beautiful suburbs were burned to the ground. It was clear that the town, if won at all, would be won street by street by the bayonet. At this conjuncture came news, that Frederic, having cleared Silesia of his enemies, was returning by forced marches into Saxony. Daun retired from before Dresden, and fell back into the Austrian territories. The King, over heaps of ruins, made his triumphant entry into the unhappy metropolis, which had so cruelly expiated the weak and perfidious policy of its sovereign. It was now the twentieth of November. The cold weather suspended military operations; and the King again took up his winter quarters at Breslau. The third of the seven terrible years were over; and Frederic still stood his ground. He had been recently tried by domestic as well as by military disasters. On the fourteenth of October, the day on which he was defeated at Hochkirchen, the day on the anniversary of which, forty-eight years later, a defeat far more tremendous laid the Prussian monarchy in the dust, died Wilhelmina, Margravine of Bareuth. From the accounts which we have of her, by her own hand, and by the hands of the most discerning of her contemporaries, we should pronounce her to have been coarse, indelicate, and a good hater, but not destitute of kind and generous feelings. Her mind, naturally strong and observant, had been highly cultivated; and she was, and deserved to be, Frederic's favourite sister. He felt the loss as much as it was in his iron nature to feel the loss of anything but a province or a battle. At Breslau, during the winter, he was indefatigable in his poetical labours. The most spirited lines, perhaps, that he ever wrote, are, to be found in a bitter lampoon on Lewis and Madame de Pompadour, which he composed at this time, and sent to Voltaire. The verses were, indeed, so good, that Voltaire was afraid that he might himself be suspected of having written them, or at least of having corrected them; and partly from fright, partly, we fear, from love of mischief, sent them to the Duke of Choiseul, then prime minister of France. Choiseul very wisely determined to encounter Frederic at Frederic's own weapons, and applied for assistance to Palissot, who had some skill as a versifier, and some little talent for satire. Palissot produced some very stinging lines on the moral and literary character of Frederic, and these lines the Duke sent to Voltaire. This war of couplets, following close on the carnage of Zorndorf and the conflagration of Dresden, illustrates well the strangely compounded character of the King of Prussia. At this moment he was assailed by a new enemy. Benedict the Fourteenth, the best and wisest of the two hundred and fifty successors of St. Peter, was no more. During the short interval between his reign and that of his disciple Ganganelli, the chief seat in the Church of Rome was filled by Rezzonico, who took the name of Clement the Thirteenth. This absurd priest determined to try what the weight of his authority could effect in favour of the orthodox Maria Theresa against a heretic king. At the high mass on Christmas-day, a sword with a rich belt and scabbard, a hat of crimson velvet lined with ermine, and a dove of pearls, the mystic symbol of the Divine Comforter, were solemnly blessed by the supreme pontiff, and were sent with great ceremony to Marshal Daun, the conqueror of Kolin and Hochkirchen. This mark of favour had more than once been bestowed by the Popes on the great champions of the faith. Similar honours had been paid, more than six centuries earlier, by Urban the Second to Godfrey of Bouillon. Similar honours had been conferred on Alba for destroying the liberties of the Low Countries, and on John Sobiesky after the deliverance of Vienna. But the presents which were received with profound reverence by the Baron of the Holy Sepulchre in the eleventh century, and which had not wholly lost their value even in the seventeenth century, appeared inexpressibly ridiculous to a generation which read Montesquieu and Voltaire. Frederic wrote sarcastic verses on the gifts, the giver, and the receiver. But the public wanted no prompter; and an universal roar of laughter from Petersburg to Lisbon reminded the Vatican that the age of crusades was over. The fourth campaign, the most disastrous of all the campaigns of this fearful war, had now opened. The Austrians filled Saxony and menaced Berlin. The Russians defeated the King's generals on the Oder, threatened Silesia, effected a junction with Laudohn, and intrenched themselves strongly at Kunersdorf. Frederic hastened to attack them. A great battle was fought. During the earlier part of the day everything yielded to the impetuosity of the Prussians, and to the skill of their chief. The lines were forced. Half the Russian guns were taken. The King sent off a courier to Berlin with two lines, announcing a complete victory. But, in the meantime, the stubborn Russians, defeated yet unbroken, had taken up their stand in an almost impregnable position, on an eminence where the Jews of Frankfort were wont to bury their dead. Here the battle recommenced. The Prussian infantry, exhausted by six hours of hard fighting under a sun which equalled the tropical heat, were yet brought up repeatedly to the attack, but in vain. The King led three charges in person. Two horses were killed under him. The officers of his staff fell all round him. His coat was pierced by several bullets. All was in vain. His infantry was driven back with frightful slaughter. Terror began to spread fast from man to man. At that moment, the fiery cavalry of Laudohn, still fresh, rushed on the wavering ranks. Then followed an universal rout. Frederic himself was on the point of falling into the hands of the conquerors, and was with difficulty saved by a gallant officer, who, at the head of a handful of Hussars, made good a diversion of a few minutes. Shattered in body, shattered in mind, the King reached that night a village which the Cossacks had plundered; and there, in a ruined and deserted farm-house, flung himself on a heap of straw. He had sent to Berlin a second despatch very different from the first:--"Let the royal family leave Berlin. Send the archives to Potsdam. The town may make terms with the enemy." The defeat was, in truth, overwhelming. Of fifty thousand men who had that morning marched under the black eagles, not three thousand remained together. The King bethought him again of his corrosive sublimate, and wrote to bid adieu to his friends, and to give directions as to the measures to be taken in the event of his death:-"I have no resource left"--such is the language of one of his letters--"all is lost. I will not survive the ruin of my country.--Farewell for ever." But the mutual jealousies of the confederates prevented them from following up their victory. They lost a few days in loitering and squabbling; and a few days, improved by Frederic, were worth more than the years of other men. On the morning after the battle, he had got together eighteen thousand of his troops. Very soon his force amounted to thirty thousand. Guns were procured from the neighbouring fortresses; and there was again an army. Berlin was for the present safe; but calamities came pouring on the King in uninterrupted succession. One of his generals, with a large body of troops, was taken at Maxen; another was defeated at Meissen; and when at length the campaign of 1759 closed, in the midst of a rigorous winter, the situation of Prussia appeared desperate. The only consoling circumstance was, that, in the West, Ferdinand of Brunswick had been more fortunate than his master; and by a series of exploits, of which the battle of Minden was the most glorious, had removed all apprehension of danger on the side of France. The fifth year was now about to commence. It seemed impossible that the Prussian territories, repeatedly devastated by hundreds of thousands of invaders, could longer support the contest. But the King carried on war as no European power has ever carried on war, except the Committee of Public Safety during the great agony of the French Revolution. He governed his kingdom as he would have governed a besieged town, not caring to what extent property was destroyed, or the pursuits of civil life suspended, so that he did but make head against the enemy. As long as there was a man left in Prussia, that man might carry a musket; as long as there was a horse left, that horse might draw artillery. The coin was debased, the civil functionaries were left unpaid; in some provinces civil government altogether ceased to exist. But there was still rye-bread and potatoes; there was still lead and gunpowder; and, while the means of sustaining and destroying life remained, Frederic was determined to fight it out to the very last. The earlier part of the campaign of 1760 was unfavourable to him. Berlin was again occupied by the enemy. Great contributions were levied on the inhabitants, and the royal palace was plundered. But at length, after two years of calamity, victory came back to his arms. At Lignitz he gained a great battle over Laudohn; at Torgau, after a day of horrible carnage, he triumphed over Daun. The fifth year closed, and still the event was in suspense. In the countries where the war had raged, the misery and exhaustion were more appalling than ever; but still there were left men and beasts, arms and food, and still Frederic fought on. In truth he had now been baited into savageness. His heart was ulcerated with hatred. The implacable resentment with which his enemies persecuted him, though originally provoked by his own unprincipled ambition, excited in him a thirst for vengeance which he did not even attempt to conceal. "It is hard," he says in one of his letters, "for a man to bear what I bear. I begin to feel that, as the Italians say, revenge is a pleasure for the gods. My philosophy is worn out by suffering. I am no saint, like those of whom we read in the legends; and I will own that I should die content if only I could first inflict a portion of the misery which I endure." Borne up by such feelings, he struggled with various success, but constant glory, through the campaign of 1761. On the whole the result of this campaign was disastrous to Prussia. No great battle was gained by the enemy; but, in spite of the desperate bounds of the hunted tiger, the circle of pursuers was fast closing round him. Laudohn had surprised the important fortress of Schweidnitz. With that fortress half of Silesia, and the command of the most important defiles through the mountains had been transferred to the Austrians. The Russians had overpowered the King's generals in Pomerania. The country was so completely desolated that he began, by his own confession, to look round him with blank despair, unable to imagine where recruits, horses, or provisions were to be found. Just at this time, two great events brought on a complete change in the relations of almost all the powers of Europe. One of those events was the retirement of Mr. Pitt from office; the other was the death of the Empress Elizabeth of Russia. The retirement of Pitt seemed to be an omen of utter ruin to the House of Brandenburg. His proud and vehement nature was incapable of anything that looked like either fear or treachery. He had often declared that, while he was in power, England should never make a peace of Utrecht, should never, for any selfish object, abandon an ally even in the last extremity of distress. The Continental war was his own war. He had been bold enough, he who in former times had attacked, with irresistible powers of oratory, the Hanoverian policy of Carteret, and the German subsidies of Newcastle, to declare that Hanover ought to be as dear to us as Hampshire, and that he would conquer America in Germany. He had fallen; and the power which he had exercised, not always with discretion, but always with vigour and genius, had devolved on a favourite who was the representative of the Tory party, of the party which had thwarted William, which had persecuted Marlborough, which had given tip the Catalans to the vengeance of Philip of Anjou. To make peace with France, to shake off, with all, or more than all, the speed compatible with decency, every Continental connection, these were among the chief objects of the new Minister. The policy then followed inspired Frederic with an unjust, but deep and bitter aversion to the English name, and produced effects which are still felt throughout the civilised world. To that policy it was owing that, some years later, England could not find on the whole Continent a single ally to stand by her, in her extreme need against the House of Bourbon. To that policy it was owing that Frederic, alienated from England, was compelled to connect himself closely, during his later years, with Russia, and was induced to assist in that great crime, the fruitful parent of other great crimes, the first partition of Poland. Scarcely had the retreat of Mr. Pitt deprived Prussia of her only friend, when the death of Elizabeth produced an entire revolution in the politics of the North. The Grand Duke Peter, her nephew, who now ascended the Russian throne, was not merely free from the prejudices which his aunt had entertained against Frederic, but was a worshipper, a servile imitator of the great King. The days of the new Czar's government were few and evil, but sufficient to produce a change in the whole state of Christendom. He set the Prussian prisoners at liberty, fitted them out decently, and sent them back to their master; he withdrew his troops from the provinces which Elizabeth had decided on incorporating with her dominions; and he absolved all those Prussian subjects, who had been compelled to swear fealty to Russia, from their engagements. Not content with concluding peace on terms favourable to Prussia, he solicited rank in the Prussian service, dressed himself in a Prussian uniform, wore the Black Eagle of Prussia on his breast, made preparations for visiting Prussia, in order to have an interview with the object of his idolatry, and actually sent fifteen thousand excellent troops to reinforce the shattered army of Frederic. Thus strengthened, the King speedily repaired the losses of the preceding year, reconquered Silesia, defeated Daun at Buckersdorf, invested and retook Schweidnitz, and, at the close of the year, presented to the forces of Maria Theresa a front as formidable as before the great reverses of 1759. Before the end of the campaign, his friend, the Emperor Peter, having, by a series of absurd insults to the institutions, manners, and feelings of his people, united them in hostility to his person and government, was deposed and murdered. The Empress, who, under the title of Catherine the Second, now assumed the supreme power, was, at the commencement of her administration, by no means partial to Frederic, and refused to permit her troops to remain under his command. But she observed the peace made by her husband; and Prussia was no longer threatened by danger from the East. England and France at the same time paired off together. They concluded a treaty, by which they bound themselves to observe neutrality with respect to the German war. Thus the coalitions on both sides were dissolved; and the original enemies, Austria and Prussia, remained alone confronting each other. Austria had undoubtedly far greater means than Prussia, and was less exhausted by hostilities; yet it seemed hardly possible that Austria could effect alone what she had in vain attempted to effect when supported by France on the one side, and by Russia on the other. Danger also began to menace the Imperial house from another quarter. The Ottoman Porte held threatening language, and a hundred thousand Turks were mustered on the frontiers of Hungary. The proud and revengeful spirit of the Empress Queen at length gave way; and, in February 1763, the peace of Hubertsburg put an end to the conflict which had, during seven years, devastated Germany. The King ceded nothing. The whole Continent in arms had proved unable to tear Silesia from that iron grasp. The war was over. Frederic was safe. His glory was beyond the reach of envy. If he had not made conquests as vast as those of Alexander, of Caesar, and of Napoleon, if he had not, on fields of battle, enjoyed the constant success of Marlborough and Wellington, he had yet given an example unrivalled in history of what capacity and resolution can effect against the greatest superiority of power, and the utmost spite of fortune. He entered Berlin in triumph, after an absence of more than six years. The streets were brilliantly lighted up; and, as he passed along in an open carriage, with Ferdinand of Brunswick at his side, the multitude saluted him with loud praises and blessings. He was moved by those marks of attachment, and repeatedly exclaimed "Long live my dear people! Long live my children!" Yet, even in the midst of that gay spectacle, he could not but perceive everywhere the traces of destruction and decay. The city had been more than once plundered. The population had considerably diminished. Berlin, however, had suffered little when compared with most parts of the kingdom. The ruin of private fortunes, the distress of all ranks, was such as might appal the firmest mind. Almost every province had been the seat of war, and of war conducted with merciless ferocity. Clouds of Croatians had descended on Silesia. Tens of thousands of Cossacks had been let loose on Pomerania and Brandenburg. The mere contributions levied by the invaders amounted, it was said, to more than a hundred millions of dollars; and the value of what they extorted was probably much less than the value of what they destroyed. The fields lay uncultivated. The very seed-corn had been devoured in the madness of hunger. Famine, and contagious maladies produced by famine, had swept away the herds and flocks; and there was reason to fear that a great pestilence among the human race was likely to follow in the train of that tremendous war. Near fifteen thousand houses had been burned to the ground. The population of the kingdom had in seven years decreased to the frightful extent of ten per cent. A sixth of the males capable of bearing arms had actually perished on the field of battle. In some districts, no labourers, except women, were seen in the fields at harvest-time. In others, the traveller passed shuddering through a succession of silent villages, in which not a single inhabitant remained. The currency had been debased; the authority of laws and magistrates had been suspended; the whole social system was deranged. For, during that convulsive struggle, everything that was not military violence was anarchy. Even the army was disorganised. Some great generals, and a crowd of excellent officers, had fallen, and it had been impossible to supply their place. The difficulty of finding recruits had, towards the close of the war, been so great, that selection and rejection were impossible. Whole battalions were composed of deserters or of prisoners. It was hardly to be hoped that thirty years of repose and industry would repair the ruin produced by seven years of havoc. One consolatory circumstance, indeed, there was. No debt had been incurred. The burdens of the war had been terrible, almost insupportable; but no arrear was left to embarrass the finances in time of peace. Here, for the present, we must pause. We have accompanied Frederic to the close of his career as a warrior. Possibly, when these Memoirs are completed, we may resume the consideration of his character, and give some account of his domestic and foreign policy, and of his private habits, during the many years of tranquillity which followed the Seven Years' War. SOUTHEY'S COLLOQUIES (Jan, 1830) Sir Thomas More; or, colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of Society. By ROBERT SOUTHEY Esq., LL.D., Poet Laureate. 2 vols. 8vo. London: 1829. IT would be scarcely possible for a man of Mr. Southey's talents and acquirements to write two volumes so large as those before us, which should be wholly destitute of information and amusement. Yet we do not remember to have read with so little satisfaction any equal quantity of matter, written by any man of real abilities. We have, for some time past, observed with great regret the strange infatuation which leads the Poet Laureate to abandon those departments of literature in which he might excel, and to lecture the public on sciences of which he has still the very alphabet to learn. He has now, we think, done his worst. The subject which he has at last undertaken to treat, is one which demands all the highest intellectual and moral qualities of a philosophical statesman, an understanding at once comprehensive and acute, a heart at once upright and charitable. Mr. Southey brings to the task two faculties which were never, we believe, vouchsafed in measure so copious to any human being, the faculty of believing without a reason, and the faculty of hating without a provocation. It is, indeed, most extraordinary, that a mind like Mr. Southey's, a mind richly endowed in many respects by nature, and highly cultivated by study, a mind which has exercised considerable influence on the most enlightened generation of the most enlightened people that ever existed, should be utterly destitute of the power of discerning truth from falsehood. Yet such is the fact. Government is to Mr. Southey one of the fine arts. He judges of a theory, of a public measure, of a religion or a political party, of a peace or a war, as men judge of a picture or a statue, by the effect produced on his imagination. A chain of associations is to him what a chain of reasoning is to other men; and what he calls his opinions are in fact merely his tastes. Part of this description might perhaps apply to a much greater man, Mr. Burke. But Mr. Burke assuredly possessed an understanding admirably fitted for the investigation of truth, an understanding stronger than that of any statesman, active or speculative, of the eighteenth century, stronger than everything, except his own fierce and ungovernable sensibility. Hence he generally chose his side like a fanatic, and defended it like a philosopher. His conduct on the most important occasions of his life, at the time of the impeachment of Hastings for example, and at the time of the French Revolution, seems to have been prompted by those feelings and motives which Mr. Coleridge has so happily described, "Stormy pity, and the cherish'd lure Of pomp, and proud precipitance of soul." Hindostan, with its vast cities, its gorgeous pagodas, its infinite swarms of dusky population, its long-descended dynasties, its stately etiquette, excited in a mind so capacious, so imaginative, and so susceptible, the most intense interest. The peculiarities of the costume, of the manners, and of the laws, the very mystery which hung over the language and origin of the people, seized his imagination. To plead under the ancient arches of Westminster Hall, in the name of the English people, at the bar of the English nobles for great nations and kings separated from him by half the world, seemed to him the height of human glory. Again, it is not difficult to perceive that his hostility to the French Revolution principally arose from the vexation which he felt at having all his old political associations disturbed, at seeing the well-known landmarks of states obliterated, and the names and distinctions with which the history of Europe had been filled for ages at once swept away. He felt like an antiquary whose shield had been scoured, or a connoisseur who found his Titian retouched. But, however he came by an opinion, he had no sooner got it than he did his best to make out a legitimate title to it. His reason, like a spirit in the service of an enchanter, though spell-bound, was still mighty. It did whatever work his passions and his imagination might impose. But it did that work, however arduous, with marvellous dexterity and vigour. His course was not determined by argument; but he could defend the wildest course by arguments more plausible than those by which common men support opinions which they have adopted after the fullest deliberation. Reason has scarcely ever displayed, even in those well-constituted minds of which she occupies the throne, so much power and energy as in the lowest offices of that imperial servitude. Now in the mind of Mr. Southey reason has no place at all, as either leader or follower, as either sovereign or slave. He does not seem to know what an argument is. He never uses arguments himself. He never troubles himself to answer the arguments of his opponents. It has never occurred to him, that a man ought to be able to give some better account of the way in which he has arrived at his opinions than merely that it is his will and pleasure to hold them. It has never occurred to him that there is a difference between assertion and demonstration, that a rumour does not always prove a fact, that a single fact, when proved, is hardly foundation enough for a theory, that two contradictory propositions cannot be undeniable truths, that to beg the question is not the way to settle it, or that when an objection is raised, it ought to be met with something more convincing than "scoundrel" and "blockhead." It would be absurd to read the works of such a writer for political instruction. The utmost that can be expected from any system promulgated by him is that it may be splendid and affecting, that it may suggest sublime and pleasing images. His scheme of philosophy is a mere day-dream, a poetical creation, like the Doindaniel cavern, the Swerga, or Padalon; and indeed it bears no inconsiderable resemblance to those gorgeous visions. Like them, it has something, of invention, grandeur, and brilliancy. But, like them, it is grotesque and extravagant, and perpetually violates even that conventional probability which is essential to the effect of works of art. The warmest admirers of Mr. Southey will scarcely, we think, deny that his success has almost always borne an inverse proportion to the degree in which his undertakings have required a logical head. His poems, taken in the mass, stand far higher than his prose works. His official Odes indeed, among which the Vision of Judgement must be classed, are, for the most part, worse than Pye's and as bad as Cibber's; nor do we think him generally happy in short pieces. But his longer poems, though full of faults, are nevertheless very extraordinary productions. We doubt greatly whether they will be read fifty years hence; but that, if they are read, they will be admired, we have no doubt whatever. But, though in general we prefer Mr. Southey's poetry to his prose, we must make one exception. The Life of Nelson is, beyond all doubt, the most perfect and the most delightful of his works. The fact is, as his poems most abundantly prove, that he is by no means so skilful in designing as in filling up. It was therefore an advantage to him to be furnished with an outline of characters and events, and to have no other task to perform than that of touching the cold sketch into life. No writer, perhaps, ever lived, whose talents so precisely qualified him to write the history of the great naval warrior. There were no fine riddles of the human heart to read, no theories to propound, no hidden causes to develop, no remote consequences to predict. The character of the hero lay on the surface. The exploits were brilliant and picturesque. The necessity of adhering to the real course of events saved Mr, Southey from those faults which deform the original plan of almost every one of his poems, and which even his innumerable beauties of detail scarcely redeem. The subject did not require the exercise of those reasoning powers the want of which is the blemish of his prose. It would not be easy to find, in all literary history, an instance of a more exact hit between wind and water. John Wesley and the Peninsular War were subjects of a very different kind, subjects which required all the qualities of a philosophic historian. In Mr. Southey's works on these subjects, he has, on the whole, failed. Yet there are charming specimens of the art of narration in both of them. The Life of Wesley will probably live. Defective as it is, it contains the only popular account of a most remarkable moral revolution, and of a man whose eloquence and logical acuteness might have made him eminent in literature, whose genius for government was not inferior to that of Richelieu, and who, whatever his errors may have been, devoted all his powers, in defiance of obloquy and derision, to what he sincerely considered as the highest good of his species. The History of the Peninsular War is already dead; indeed, the second volume was dead-born. The glory of producing an imperishable record of that great conflict seems to be reserved for Colonel Napier. The Book of the Church contains some stories very prettily told. The rest is mere rubbish. The adventure was manifestly one which could be achieved only by a profound thinker, and one in which even a profound thinker might have failed, unless his passions had been kept under strict control. But in all those works in which Mr. Southey has completely abandoned narration, and has undertaken to argue moral and political questions, his failure has been complete and ignominious. On such occasions his writings are rescued from utter contempt and derision solely by the beauty and purity of the English. We find, we confess, so great a charm in Mr. Southey's style, that, even when be writes nonsense, we generally read it with pleasure except indeed when he tries to be droll. A more insufferable jester never existed. He very often attempts to be humorous, and yet we do not remember a single occasion on which he has succeeded further than to be quaintly and flippantly dull. In one of his works he tells us that Bishop Sprat was very properly so called, inasmuch as he was a very small poet. And in the book now before us he cannot quote Francis Bugg, the renegade Quaker, without a remark on his unsavoury name. A wise man might talk folly like this by his own fireside; but that any human being, after having made such a joke, should write it down, and copy it out, and transmit it to the printer, and correct the proof-sheets, and send it forth into the world, is enough to make us ashamed of our species. The extraordinary bitterness of spirit which Mr. Southey manifests towards his opponents is, no doubt, in a great measure to be attributed to the manner in which he forms his opinions. Differences of taste, it has often been remarked, produce greater exasperation than differences on points of science. But this is not all. A peculiar austerity marks almost all Mr. Southey's judgments of men and actions. We are far from blaming him for fixing on a high standard of morals, and for applying that standard to every case. But rigour ought to be accompanied by discernment; and of discernment Mr. Southey seems to be utterly destitute. His mode of judging is monkish. It is exactly what we should expect from a stern old Benedictine, who had been preserved from many ordinary frailties by the restraints of his situation. No man out of a cloister ever wrote about love, for example, so coldly and at the same time me so grossly. His descriptions of it are just what we should hear from a recluse who knew the passion only from the details of the confessional. Almost all his heroes make love either like Seraphim or like cattle. He seems to have no notion of anything between the Platonic passion of the Glendoveer who gazes with rapture on his mistress's leprosy, and the brutal appetite of Arvalan and Roderick. In Roderick, indeed, the two characters are united. He is first all clay, and then all spirit. He goes forth a Tarquin, and comes back too ethereal to be married. The only love scene, as far as we can recollect, in Madoc, consists of the delicate attentions which a savage, who has drunk too much of the Prince's excellent metheglin, offers to Goervyl. It would be the labour of a week to find, in all the vast mass of Mr. Southey's poetry, a single passage indicating any sympathy with those feelings which have consecrated the shades of Vaucluse and the rocks of Meillerie. Indeed, if we except some very pleasing images of paternal tenderness and filial duty, there is scarcely anything soft or humane in Mr. Southey's poetry. What theologians call the spiritual sins are his cardinal virtues, hatred, pride, and the insatiable thirst of vengeance. These passions he disguises under the name of duties; he purifies them from the alloy of vulgar interests; he ennobles them by uniting them with energy, fortitude, and a severe sanctity of manners; and he then holds them up to the admiration of mankind. This is the spirit of Thalaba, of Ladurlad, of Adosinda, of Roderick after his conversion. It is the spirit which, in all his writings, Mr. Southey appears to affect. "I do well to be angry," seems to be the predominant feeling of his mind. Almost the only mark of charity which he vouchsafes to his opponents is to pray for their reformation; and this he does in terms not unlike those in which we can imagine a Portuguese priest interceding with Heaven for a Jew, delivered over to the secular arm after a relapse. We have always heard, and fully believe, that Mr. Southey is a very amiable and humane man; nor do we intend to apply to him personally any of the remarks which we have made on the spirit of his writings. Such are the caprices of human nature. Even Uncle Toby troubled himself very little about the French grenadiers who fell on the glacis of Namur. And Mr. Southey, when he takes up his pen, changes his nature as much as Captain Shandy when he girt on his sword. The only opponents to whom the Laureate gives quarter are those in whom he finds something of his own character reflected. He seems to have an instinctive antipathy for calm, moderate men, for men who shun extremes, and who render reasons. He has treated Mr. Owen of Lanark, for example, with infinitely more respect than he has shown to Mr. Hallam or to Dr. Lingard; and this for no reason that we can discover, except that Mr. Owen is more unreasonably and hopelessly in the wrong than any speculator of our time. Mr. Southey's political system is just what we might expect from a man who regards politics, not as matter of science, but as matter of taste and feeling. All his schemes of government have been inconsistent with themselves. In his youth he was a republican; yet, as he tells us in his preface to these Colloquies, he was even then opposed to the Catholic Claims. He is now a violent Ultra-Tory. Yet, while he maintains, with vehemence approaching to ferocity, all the sterner and harsher parts of the Ultra-Tory theory of government, the baser and dirtier part of that theory disgusts him. Exclusion, persecution, severe punishments for libellers and demagogues, proscriptions, massacres, civil war, if necessary, rather than any concession to a discontented people; these are the measures which he seems inclined to recommend. A severe and gloomy tyranny, crushing opposition, silencing remonstrance, drilling the minds of the people into unreasoning obedience, has in it something of grandeur which delights his imagination. But there is nothing fine in the shabby tricks and jobs of office; and Mr. Southey, accordingly, has no toleration for them. When a Jacobin, he did not perceive that his system led logically, and would have led practically, to the removal of religious distinctions. He now commits a similar error. He renounces the abject and paltry part of the creed of his party, without perceiving that it is also an essential part of that creed. He would have tyranny and purity together; though the most superficial observation might have shown him that there can be no tyranny without corruption. It is high time, however, that we should proceed to the consideration of the work which is our more immediate subject, and which, indeed, illustrates in almost every page our general remarks on Mr. Southey's writings. In the preface, we are informed that the author, notwithstanding some statements to the contrary, was always opposed to the Catholic Claims. We fully believe this; both because we are sure that Mr. Southey is incapable of publishing a deliberate falsehood, and because his assertion is in itself probable. We should have expected that, even in his wildest paroxysms of democratic enthusiasm, Mr. Southey would have felt no wish to see a simple remedy applied to a great practical evil. We should have expected that the only measure which all the great statesmen of two generations have agreed with each other in supporting would be the only measure which Mr. Southey would have agreed with himself in opposing. He has passed from one extreme of political opinion to another, as Satan in Milton went round the globe, contriving constantly to "ride with darkness." Wherever the thickest shadow of the night may at any moment chance to fall, there is Mr. Southey. It is not everybody who could have so dexterously avoided blundering on the daylight in the course of a journey to the antipodes. Mr. Southey has not been fortunate in the plan of any of his fictitious narratives. But he has never failed so conspicuously as in the work before us; except, indeed, in the wretched Vision of Judgement. In November 1817, it seems the Laureate was sitting over his newspaper, and meditating about the death of the Princess Charlotte. An elderly person of very dignified aspect makes his appearance, announces himself as a stranger from a distant country, and apologises very politely for not having provided himself with letters of introduction. Mr. Southey supposes his visitor to be some American gentleman who has come to see the lakes and the lake-poets, and accordingly proceeds to perform, with that grace, which only long practice can give, all the duties which authors owe to starers. He assures his guest that some of the most agreeable visits which he has received have been from Americans, and that he knows men among them whose talents and virtues would do honour to any country. In passing we may observe, to the honour of Mr. Southey, that, though he evidently has no liking for the American institutions, he never speaks of the people of the United States with that pitiful affectation of contempt by which some members of his party have done more than wars or tariffs can do to excite mutual enmity between two communities formed for mutual fellowship. Great as the faults of his mind are, paltry spite like this has no place in it. Indeed it is scarcely conceivable that a man of his sensibility and his imagination should look without pleasure and national pride on the vigorous and splendid youth of a great people, whose veins are filled with our blood, whose minds are nourished with our literature, and on whom is entailed the rich inheritance of our civilisation, our freedom, and our glory. But we must return to Mr. Southey's study at Keswick. The visitor informs the hospitable poet that he is not an American but a spirit. Mr. Southey, with more frankness than civility, tells him that he is a very queer one. The stranger holds out his hand. It has neither weight nor substance. Mr. Southey upon this becomes more serious; his hair stands on end; and he adjures the spectre to tell him what he is, and why he comes. The ghost turns out to be Sir Thomas More. The traces of martyrdom, it seems, are worn in the other world, as stars and ribands are worn in this. Sir Thomas shows the poet a red streak round his neck, brighter than a ruby, and informs him that Cranmer wears a suit of flames in Paradise, the right hand glove, we suppose, of peculiar brilliancy. Sir Thomas pays but a short visit on this occasion, but promises to cultivate the new acquaintance which he has formed, and, after begging that his visit may be kept secret from Mrs. Southey, vanishes into air. The rest of the book consists of conversations between Mr. Southey and the spirit about trade, currency, Catholic emancipation, periodical literature, female nunneries, butchers, snuff, bookstalls, and a hundred other subjects. Mr. Southey very hospitably takes an opportunity to escort the ghost round the lakes, and directs his attention to the most beautiful points of view. Why a spirit was to be evoked for the purpose of talking over such matters and seeing such sights, why the vicar of the parish, a blue-stocking from London, or an American, such as Mr. Southey at first supposed the aerial visitor to be, might not have done as well, we are unable to conceive. Sir Thomas tells Mr. Southey nothing about future events, and indeed absolutely disclaims the gifts of prescience. He has learned to talk modern English. He has read all the new publications, and loves a jest as well as when he jested with the executioner, though we cannot say that the quality of his wit has materially improved in Paradise. His powers of reasoning, too, are by no means in as great vigour as when he sate on the woolsack; and though he boasts that he is "divested of all those passions which cloud the intellects and warp the understandings of men," we think him, we must confess, far less stoical than formerly. As to revelations, he tells Mr. Southey at the outset to expect none from him. The Laureate expresses some doubts, which assuredly will not raise him in the opinion of our modern millennarians, as to the divine authority of the Apocalypse. But the ghost preserves an impenetrable silence. As far as we remember, only one hint about the employment of disembodied spirits escapes him. He encourages Mr. Southey to hope that there is a Paradise Press, at which all the valuable publications of Mr. Murray and Mr. Colburn are reprinted as regularly as at Philadelphia; and delicately insinuates that Thalaba and the Curse of Kehama are among the number. What a contrast does this absurd fiction present to those charming narratives which Plato and Cicero prefixed to their dialogues! What cost in machinery, yet what poverty of effect! A ghost brought in to say what any man might have said! The glorified spirit of a great statesman and philosopher dawdling, like a bilious old nabob at a watering-place, over quarterly reviews and novels, dropping in to pay long calls, making excursions in search of the picturesque! The scene of St. George and St. Dennis in the Pucelle is hardly more ridiculous. We know what Voltaire meant. Nobody, however, can suppose that Mr. Southey means to make game of the mysteries of a higher state of existence. The fact is that, in the work before us, in the Vision of Judgement, and in some of his other pieces, his mode of treating the most solemn subjects differs from that of open scoffers only as the extravagant representations of sacred persons and things in some grotesque Italian paintings differ from the caricatures which Carlile exposes in the front of his shop. We interpret the particular act by the general character. What in the window of a convicted blasphemer we call blasphemous, we call only absurd and ill-judged in an altar-piece. We now come to the conversations which pass between Mr. Southey and Sir Thomas More, or rather between two Southeys, equally eloquent, equally angry, equally unreasonable, and equally given to talking about what they do not understand. [A passage in which some expressions used by Mr. Southey were misrepresented, certainly without any unfair intention, has been here omitted.] Perhaps we could not select a better instance of the spirit which pervades the whole book than the passages in which Mr. Southey gives his opinion of the manufacturing system. There is nothing which he hates so bitterly. It is, according to him, a system more tyrannical than that of the feudal ages, a system of actual servitude, a system which destroys the bodies and degrades the minds of those who are engaged in it. He expresses a hope that the competition of other nations may drive us out of the field; that our foreign trade may decline; and that we may thus enjoy a restoration of national sanity and strength. But he seems to think that the extermination of the whole manufacturing population would be a blessing, if the evil could be removed in no other way. Mr. Southey does not bring forward a single fact in support of these views; and, as it seems to us, there are facts which lead to a very different conclusion. In the first place, the poor-rate is very decidedly lower in the manufacturing than in the agricultural districts. If Mr. Southey will look over the Parliamentary returns on this subject, he will find that the amount of parochial relief required by the labourers in the different counties of England is almost exactly in inverse proportion to the degree in which the manufacturing system has been introduced into those counties. The returns for the years ending in March 1825, and in March 1828, are now before us. In the former year we find the poor-rate highest in Sussex, about twenty shillings to every inhabitant. Then come Buckinghamshire, Essex, Suffolk, Bedfordshire, Huntingdonshire, Kent, and Norfolk. In all these the rate is above fifteen shillings a head. We will not go through the whole. Even in Westmoreland and the North Riding of Yorkshire, the rate is at more than eight shillings. In Cumberland and Monmouthshire, the most fortunate of all the agricultural districts, it is at six shillings. But in the West Riding of Yorkshire, it is as low as five shillings. and when we come to Lancashire, we find it at four shillings, one-fifth of what it is in Sussex. The returns of the year ending in March 1828 are a little, and but a little, more unfavourable to the manufacturing districts. Lancashire, even in that season of distress, required a smaller poor-rate than any other district, and little more than one-fourth of the poor-rate raised in Sussex. Cumberland alone, of the agricultural districts, was as well off as the West Riding of Yorkshire. These facts seem to indicate that the manufacturer is both in a more comfortable and in a less dependent situation than the agricultural labourer. As to the effect of the manufacturing system on the bodily health, we must beg leave to estimate it by a standard far too low and vulgar for a mind so imaginative as that of Mr. Southey, the proportion of births and deaths. We know that, during the growth of this atrocious system, this new misery, to use the phrases of Mr. Southey, this new enormity, this birth of a portentous age, this pest which no man can approve whose heart is not scared or whose understanding has not been darkened, there has been a great diminution of mortality, and that this diminution has been greater in the manufacturing towns than anywhere else. The mortality still is, as it always was, greater in towns than in the country. But the difference has diminished in an extraordinary degree. There is the best reason to believe that the annual mortality of Manchester, about the middle of the last century, was one in twenty-eight. It is now reckoned at one in forty-five. In Glasgow and Leeds a similar improvement has taken place. Nay, the rate of mortality in those three great capitals of the manufacturing districts is now considerably less than it was, fifty years ago, over England and Wales, taken together, open country and all. We might with some plausibility maintain that the people live longer because they are better fed, better lodged, better clothed, and better attended in sickness, and that these improvements are owing to that increase of national wealth which the manufacturing system has produced. Much more might be said on this subject. But to what end? It is not from bills of mortality and statistical tables that Mr. Southey has learned his political creed. He cannot stoop to study the history of the system which he abuses, to strike the balance between the good and evil which it has produced, to compare district with district, or generation with generation.  We will give his own reason for his opinion, the only reason which he gives for it, in his own words:-- "We remained a while in silence looking upon the assemblage of dwellings below. Here, and in the adjoining hamlet of Millbeck, the effects of manufactures and of agriculture may be seen and compared. The old cottages are such as the poet and the painter equally delight in beholding. Substantially built of the native stone without mortar, dirtied with no white lime, and their long low roofs covered with slate, if they had been raised by the magic of some indigenous Amphion's music, the materials could not have adjusted themselves more beautifully in accord with the surrounding scene; and time has still further harmonized them with weather stains, lichens, and moss, short grasses, and short fern, and stone-plants of various kinds. The ornamented chimneys, round or square, less adorned than those which, like little turrets, crest the houses of the Portuguese peasantry; and yet not less happily suited to their place, the hedge of clipt box beneath the windows, the rose-bushes beside the door, the little patch of flower-ground, with its tall hollyhocks in front; the garden beside, the bee-hives, and the orchard with its bank of daffodils and snow-drops, the earliest and the profusest in these parts, indicate in the owners some portion of ease and leisure, some regard to neatness and comfort, some sense of natural, and innocent, and healthful enjoyment. The new cottages of the manufacturers are upon the manufacturing pattern--naked, and in a row. "'How is it,' said I, 'that everything which is connected with manufactures presents such features of unqualified deformity? From the largest of Mammon's temples down to the poorest hovel in which his helotry are stalled, these edifices have all one character. Time will not mellow them; nature will neither clothe nor conceal them; and they will remain always as offensive to the eye as to the mind.'" Here is wisdom. Here are the principles on which nations are to be governed. Rose-bushes and poor-rates, rather than steam- engines and independence. Mortality and cottages with weather- stains, rather than health and long life with edifices which time cannot mellow. We are told, that our age has invented atrocities beyond the imagination of our fathers; that society has been brought into a state compared with which extermination would be a blessing; and all because the dwellings of cotton-spinners are naked and rectangular. Mr. Southey has found out a way, he tells us, in which the effects of manufactures and agriculture may be compared. And what is this way? To stand on a hill, to look at a cottage and a factory, and to see which is the prettier. Does Mr. Southey think that the body of the English peasantry live, or ever lived, in substantial or ornamented cottages, with box- hedges, flower-gardens, beehives, and orchards? If not, what is his parallel worth? We despise those mock philosophers, who think that they serve the cause of science by depreciating literature and the fine arts. But if anything could excuse their narrowness of mind, it would be such a book as this. It is not strange that, when one enthusiast makes the picturesque the test of political good, another should feel inclined to proscribe altogether the pleasures of taste and imagination. Thus it is that Mr. Southey reasons about matters with which he thinks himself perfectly conversant. We cannot, therefore, be surprised to find that he commits extraordinary blunders when he writes on points of which he acknowledges himself to be ignorant. He confesses that he is not versed in political economy, and that he has neither liking nor aptitude for it; and he then proceeds to read the public a lecture concerning it which fully bears out his confession. "All wealth," says Sir Thomas More, "in former times was tangible. It consisted in land, money, or chattels, which were either of real or conventional value." Montesinos, as Mr. Southey somewhat affectedly calls himself, answers thus:-- "Jewels, for example, and pictures, as in Holland, where indeed at one time tulip bulbs answered the same purpose." "That bubble," says Sir Thomas, "was one of those contagious insanities to which communities are subject. All wealth was real, till the extent of commerce rendered a paper currency necessary; which differed from precious stones and pictures in this important point, that there was no limit to its production." "We regard it," says Montesinos, "as the representative of real wealth; and, therefore, limited always to the amount of what it represents." "Pursue that notion," answers the ghost, "and you will be in the dark presently. Your provincial banknotes, which constitute almost wholly the circulating medium of certain districts, pass current to-day. Tomorrow tidings may come that the house which issued them has stopt payment, and what do they represent then? You will find them the shadow of a shade." We scarcely know at which end to begin to disentangle this knot of absurdities. We might ask, why it should be a greater proof of insanity in men to set a high value on rare tulips than on rare stones, which are neither more useful nor more beautiful? We might ask how it can be said that there is no limit to the production of paper money, when a man is hanged if he issues any in the name of another, and is forced to cash what he issues in his own? But Mr. Southey's error lies deeper still. "All wealth," says he, "was tangible and real till paper currency was introduced." Now, was there ever, since men emerged from a state of utter barbarism, an age in which there were no debts? Is not a debt, while the solvency of the debtor is undoubted, always reckoned as part of the wealth of the creditor? Yet is it tangible and real wealth? Does it cease to be wealth, because there is the security of a written acknowledgment for it? And what else is paper currency? Did Mr. Southey ever read a banknote? If he did, he would see that it is a written acknowledgment of a debt, and a promise to pay that debt. The promise may be violated, the debt may remain unpaid: those to whom it was due may suffer: but this is a risk not confined to cases of paper currency: it is a risk inseparable from the relation of debtor and creditor. Every man who sells goods for anything but ready money runs the risk of finding that what he considered as part of his wealth one day is nothing at all the next day. Mr. Southey refers to the picture-galleries of Holland. The pictures were undoubtedly real and tangible possessions. But surely it might happen that a burgomaster might owe a picture- dealer a thousand guilders for a Teniers. What in this case corresponds to our paper money is not the picture, which is tangible, but the claim of the picture-dealer on his customer for the price of the picture; and this claim is not tangible. Now, would not the picture-dealer consider this claim as part of his wealth? Would not a tradesman who knew of the claim give credit to the picture-dealer the more readily on account of the claim? The burgomaster might be ruined. If so, would not those consequences follow which, as Mr. Southey tells us, were never heard of till paper money came into use? Yesterday this claim was worth a thousand guilders. To-day what is it? The shadow of a shade. It is true that, the more readily claims of this sort are transferred from hand to hand, the more extensive will be the injury produced by a single failure. The laws of all nations sanction, in certain cases, the transfer of rights not yet reduced into possession. Mr. Southey would scarcely wish, we should think, that all indorsements of bills and notes should be declared invalid. Yet even if this were done, the transfer of claims would imperceptibly take place, to a very great extent. When the baker trusts the butcher, for example, he is in fact, though not in form, trusting the butcher's customers. A man who owes large bills to tradesmen, and fails to pay them, almost always produces distress through a very wide circle of people with whom he never dealt. In short, what Mr. Southey takes for a difference in kind is only a difference of form and degree. In every society men have claims on the property of others. In every society there is a possibility that some debtors may not be able to fulfil their obligations. In every society, therefore, there is wealth which is not tangible, and which may become the shadow of a shade. Mr. Southey then proceeds to a dissertation on the national debt, which he considers in a new and most consolatory light, as a clear addition to the income of the country. "You can understand," says Sir Thomas, "that it constitutes a great part of the national wealth." "So large a part," answers Montesinos, "that the interest amounted, during the prosperous times of agriculture, to as much as the rental of all the land in Great Britain; and at present to the rental of all lands, all houses, and all other fixed property put together." The Ghost and Laureate agree that it is very desirable that there should be so secure and advantageous a deposit for wealth as the funds afford. Sir Thomas then proceeds: "Another and far more momentous benefit must not be overlooked; the expenditure of an annual interest, equalling, as you have stated, the present rental of all fixed property." "That expenditure," quoth Montesinos, "gives employment to half the industry in the kingdom, and feeds half the mouths. Take, indeed, the weight of the national debt from this great and complicated social machine, and the wheels must stop." From this passage we should have been inclined to think that Mr. Southey supposes the dividends to be a free gift periodically sent down from heaven to the fundholders, as quails and manna were sent to the Israelites; were it not that he has vouchsafed, in the following question and answer, to give the public some information which, we believe, was very little needed. "Whence comes the interest?" says Sir Thomas. "It is raised," answers Montesinos, "by taxation." Now, has Mr. Southey ever considered what would be done with this sum if it were not paid as interest to the national creditor? If he would think over this matter for a short time, we suspect that the "momentous benefit" of which he talks would appear to him to shrink strangely in amount. A fundholder, we will suppose, spends dividends amounting to five hundred pounds a year; and his ten nearest neighbours pay fifty pounds each to the tax-gatherer, for the purpose of discharging the interest of the national debt. If the debt were wiped out, a measure, be it understood, which we by no means recommend, the fundholder would cease to spend his five hundred pounds a year. He would no longer give employment to industry, or put food into the mouths of labourers. This Mr. Southey thinks a fearful evil. But is there no mitigating circumstance? Each of the ten neighbours of our fundholder has fifty pounds a year more than formerly. Each of them will, as it seems to our feeble understandings, employ more industry and feed more mouths than formerly. The sum is exactly the same. It is in different hands. But on what grounds does Mr. Southey call upon us to believe that it is in the hands of men who will spend it less liberally or less judiciously? He seems to think that nobody but a fundholder can employ the poor; that, if a tax is remitted, those who formerly used to pay it proceed immediately to dig holes in the earth, and to bury the sum which the Government had been accustomed to take; that no money can set industry in motion till such money has been taken by the tax-gatherer out of one man's pocket and put into another man's pocket. We really wish that Mr. Southey would try to prove this principle, which is indeed the foundation of his whole theory of finance: for we think it right to hint to him that our hard-hearted and unimaginative generation will expect some more satisfactory reason than the only one with which he has yet favoured it, namely, a similitude touching evaporation and dew. Both the theory and the illustration, indeed, are old friends of ours. In every season of distress which we can remember, Mr. Southey has been proclaiming that it is not from economy, but from increased taxation, that the country must expect relief; and he still, we find, places the undoubting faith of a political Diafoirus, in his "Resaignare, repurgare, et reclysterizare." "A people," he tells us, "may be too rich, but a government cannot be so." "A state," says he, "cannot have more wealth at its command than may be employed for the general good, a liberal expenditure in national works being one of the surest means of promoting national prosperity; and the benefit being still more obvious, of an expenditure directed to the purposes of national improvement. But a people may be too rich." We fully admit that a state cannot have at its command more wealth than may be employed for the general good. But neither can individuals, or bodies of individuals, have at their command more wealth than may be employed for the general good. If there be no limit to the sum which may be usefully laid out in public works and national improvement, then wealth, whether in the hands of private men or of the Government, may always, if the possessors choose to spend it usefully, be usefully spent. The only ground, therefore, on which Mr. Southey can possibly maintain that a government cannot be too rich, but that a people may be too rich, must be this, that governments are more likely to spend their money on good objects than private individuals. But what is useful expenditure? "A liberal expenditure in national works," says Mr. Southey, "is one of the surest means for promoting national prosperity." What does he mean by national prosperity? Does he mean the wealth of the State? If so, his reasoning runs thus: The more wealth a state has the better; for the more wealth a state has the more wealth it will have. This is surely something like that fallacy, which is ungallantly termed a lady's reason. If by national prosperity he means the wealth of the people, of how gross a contradiction is Mr. Southey guilty. A people, he tells us, may be too rich: a government cannot: for a government can employ its riches in making the people richer. The wealth of the people is to be taken from them, because they have too much, and laid out in works, which will yield them more. We are really at a loss to determine whether Mr. Southey's reason for recommending large taxation is that it will make the people rich, or that it will make them poor. But we are sure that, if his object is to make them rich, he takes the wrong course. There are two or three principles respecting public works, which, as an experience of vast extent proves, may be trusted in almost every case. It scarcely ever happens that any private man or body of men will invest property in a canal, a tunnel, or a bridge, but from an expectation that the outlay will be profitable to them. No work of this sort can be profitable to private speculators, unless the public be willing to pay for the use of it. The public will not pay of their own accord for what yields no profit or convenience to them. There is thus a direct and obvious connection between the motive which induces individuals to undertake such a work, and the utility of the work. Can we find any such connection in the case of a public work executed by a government? If it is useful, are the individuals who rule the country richer? If it is useless, are they poorer? A public man may be solicitous for his credit. But is not he likely to gain more credit by an useless display of ostentatious architecture in a great town than by the best road or the best canal in some remote province? The fame of public works is a much less certain test of their utility than the amount of toll collected at them. In a corrupt age, there will be direct embezzlement. In the purest age, there will be abundance of jobbing. Never were the statesmen of any country more sensitive to public opinion, and more spotless in pecuniary transactions, than those who have of late governed England. Yet we have only to look at the buildings recently erected in London for a proof of our rule. In a bad age, the fate of the public is to be robbed outright. In a good age, it is merely to have the dearest and the worst of everything. Buildings for State purposes the State must erect. And here we think that, in general, the State ought to stop. We firmly believe that five hundred thousand pounds subscribed by individuals for rail-roads or canals would produce more advantage to the public than five millions voted by Parliament for the same purpose. There are certain old saws about the master's eye and about everybody's business, in which we place very great faith. There is, we have said, no consistency in Mr. Southey's political system. But if there be in his political system any leading principle, any one error which diverges more widely and variously than any other, it is that of which his theory about national works is a ramification. He conceives that the business of the magistrate is, not merely to see that the persons and property of the people are secure from attack, but that he ought to be a jack-of-all-trades, architect, engineer, schoolmaster, merchant, theologian, a Lady Bountiful in every parish, a Paul Pry in every house, spying, eaves-dropping, relieving, admonishing, spending our money for us, and choosing our opinions for us. His principle is, if we understand it rightly, that no man can do anything so well for himself as his rulers, be they who they may, can do it for him, and that a government approaches nearer and nearer to perfection, in proportion as it interferes more and more with the habits and notions of individuals. He seems to be fully convinced that it is in the power of government to relieve all the distresses under which the lower orders labour. Nay, he considers doubt on this subject as impious. We cannot refrain from quoting his argument on this subject. It is a perfect jewel of logic: "'Many thousands in your metropolis,' says Sir Thomas More, 'rise every morning without knowing how they are to subsist during the day; as many of them, where they are to lay their heads at night. All men, even the vicious themselves, know that wickedness leads to misery: but many, even among the good and the wise, have yet to learn that misery is almost as often the cause of wickedness.' "'There are many,' says Montesinos, 'who know this, but believe that it is not in the power of human institutions to prevent this misery. They see the effect, but regard the causes as inseparable from the condition of human nature.' "'As surely as God is good,' replies Sir Thomas, 'so surely there is no such thing as necessary evil. For, by the religious mind, sickness, and pain, and death, are not to be accounted evils.'" Now if sickness, pain, and death, are not evils, we cannot understand why it should be an evil that thousands should rise without knowing how they are to subsist. The only evil of hunger is that it produces first pain, then sickness, and finally death. If it did not produce these, it would be no calamity. If these are not evils, it is no calamity. We will propose a very plain dilemma: either physical pain is an evil, or it is not an evil. If it is an evil, then there is necessary evil in the universe: if it is not, why should the poor be delivered from it? Mr. Southey entertains as exaggerated a notion of the wisdom of governments as of their power. He speaks with the greatest disgust of the respect now paid to public opinion. That opinion is, according to him, to be distrusted and dreaded; its usurpation ought to be vigorously resisted; and the practice of yielding to it is likely to ruin the country. To maintain police is, according to him, only one of the ends of government. The duties of a ruler are patriarchal and paternal. He ought to consider the moral discipline of the people as his first object, to establish a religion, to train the whole community in that religion, and to consider all dissenters as his own enemies. "'Nothing,' says Sir Thomas, 'is more certain, than that religion is the basis upon which civil government rests; that from religion power derives its authority, laws their efficacy, and both their zeal and sanction; and it is necessary that this religion be established as for the security of the state, and for the welfare of the people, who would otherwise be moved to and fro with every wind of doctrine. A state is secure in proportion as the people are attached to its institutions; it is, therefore, the first and plainest rule of sound policy, that the people be trained up in the way they should go. The state that neglects this prepares its own destruction; and they who train them in any other way are undermining it. Nothing in abstract science can be more certain than these positions are.' "'All of which,' answers Montesinos, 'are nevertheless denied by our professors of the arts Babblative and Scribblative: some in the audacity of evil designs, and others in the glorious assurance of impenetrable ignorance.' The greater part of the two volumes before us is merely an amplification of these paragraphs. What does Mr. Southey mean by saying that religion is demonstrably the basis of civil government? He cannot surely mean that men have no motives except those derived from religion for establishing and supporting civil government, that no temporal advantage is derived from civil government, that men would experience no temporal inconvenience from living in a state of anarchy? If he allows, as we think he must allow, that it is for the good of mankind in this world to have civil government, and that the great majority of mankind have always thought it for their good in this world to have civil government, we then have a basis for government quite distinct from religion. It is true that the Christian religion sanctions government, as it sanctions everything which promotes the happiness and virtue of our species. But we are at a loss to conceive in what sense religion can be said to be the basis of government, in which religion is not also the basis of the practices of eating, drinking, and lighting fires in cold weather. Nothing in history is more certain than that government has existed, has received some obedience, and has given some protection, in times in which it derived no support from religion, in times in which there was no religion that influenced the hearts and lives of men. It was not from dread of Tartarus, or from belief in the Elysian fields, that an Athenian wished to have some institutions which might keep Orestes from filching his cloak, or Midias from breaking his head. "It is from religion," says Mr. Southey, "that power derives its authority, and laws their efficacy." From what religion does our power over the Hindoos derive its authority, or the law in virtue of which we hang Brahmins its efficacy? For thousands of years civil government has existed in almost every corner of the world, in ages of priestcraft, in ages of fanaticism, in ages of Epicurean indifference, in ages of enlightened piety. However pure or impure the faith of the people might be, whether they adored a beneficent or a malignant power, whether they thought the soul mortal or immortal, they have, as soon as they ceased to be absolute savages, found out their need of civil government, and instituted it accordingly. It is as universal as the practice of cookery. Yet, it is as certain, says Mr. Southey, as anything in abstract science, that government is founded on religion. We should like to know what notion Mr. Southey has of the demonstrations of abstract science. A very vague one, we suspect. The proof proceeds. As religion is the basis of government, and as the State is secure in proportion as the people are attached to public institutions, it is therefore, says Mr. Southey, the first rule of policy, that the government should train the people in the way in which they should go; and it is plain that those who train them in any other way are undermining the State. Now it does not appear to us to be the first object that people should always believe in the established religion and be attached to the established government. A religion may be false. A government may be oppressive. And whatever support government gives to false religions, or religion to oppressive governments, we consider as a clear evil. The maxim, that governments ought to train the people in the way in which they should go, sounds well. But is there any reason for believing that a government is more likely to lead the people in the right way than the people to fall into the right way of themselves? Have there not been governments which were blind leaders of the blind? Are there not still such governments? Can it be laid down as a general rule that the movement of political and religious truth is rather downwards from the government to the people than upwards from the people to the government? These are questions which it is of importance to have clearly resolved. Mr. Southey declaims against public opinion, which is now, he tells us, usurping supreme power. Formerly, according to him, the laws governed; now public opinion governs. What are laws but expressions of the opinion of some class which has power over the rest of the community? By what was the world ever governed but by the opinion of some person or persons? By what else can it ever be governed? What are all systems, religious, political, or scientific, but opinions resting on evidence more or less satisfactory? The question is not between human opinion and some higher and more certain mode of arriving at truth, but between opinion and opinion, between the opinions of one man and another, or of one class and another, or of one generation and another. Public opinion is not infallible; but can Mr. Southey construct any institutions which shall secure to us the guidance of an infallible opinion? Can Mr. Southey select any family, any profession, any class, in short, distinguished by any plain badge from the rest of the community, whose opinion is more likely to be just than this much abused public opinion? Would he choose the peers, for example? Or the two hundred tallest men in the country? Or the poor Knights of Windsor? Or children who are born with cauls? Or the seventh sons of seventh sons? We cannot suppose that he would recommend popular election; for that is merely an appeal to public opinion. And to say that society ought to be governed by the opinion of the wisest and best, though true, is useless. Whose opinion is to decide who are the wisest and best? Mr. Southey and many other respectable people seem to think that, when they have once proved the moral and religious training of the people to be a most important object, it follows, of course, that it is an object which the government ought to pursue. They forget that we have to consider, not merely the goodness of the end, but also the fitness of the means. Neither in the natural nor in the political body have all members the same office. There is surely no contradiction in saying that a certain section of the community may be quite competent to protect the persons and property of the rest, yet quite unfit to direct our opinions, or to superintend our private habits. So strong is the interest of a ruler to protect his subjects against all depredations and outrages except his own, so clear and simple are the means by which this end is to be effected, that men are probably better off under the worst governments in the world than they would be in a state of anarchy. Even when the appointment of magistrates has been left to chance, as in the Italian Republics, things have gone on far better than if there had been no magistrates at all, and if every man had done what seemed right in his own eyes. But we see no reason for thinking that the opinions of the magistrate on speculative questions are more likely to be right than those of any other man. None of the modes by which a magistrate is appointed, popular election, the accident of the lot, or the accident of birth, affords, as far as we can perceive, much security for his being wiser than any of his neighbours. The chance of his being wiser than all his neighbours together is still smaller. Now we cannot understand how it can be laid down that it is the duty and the right of one class to direct the opinions of another, unless it can be proved that the former class is more likely to form just opinions than the latter. The duties of government would be, as Mr. Southey says that they are, paternal, if a government were necessarily as much superior in wisdom to a people as the most foolish father, for a time, is to the most intelligent child, and if a government loved a people as fathers generally love their children. But there is no reason to believe that a government will have either the paternal warmth of affection or the paternal superiority of intellect. Mr. Southey might as well say that the duties of the shoemaker are paternal, and that it is an usurpation in any man not of the craft to say that his shoes are bad and to insist on having better. The division of labour would be no blessing, if those by whom a thing is done were to pay no attention to the opinion of those for whom it is done. The shoemaker, in the Relapse, tells Lord Foppington that his Lordship is mistaken in supposing that his shoe pinches. "It does not pinch; it cannot pinch; I know my business; and I never made a better shoe." This is the way in which Mr. Southey would have a government treat a people who usurp the privilege of thinking. Nay, the shoemaker of Vanbrugh has the advantage in the comparison. He contented himself with regulating his customer's shoes, about which he had peculiar means of information, and did not presume to dictate about the coat and hat. But Mr. Southey would have the rulers of a country prescribe opinions to the people, not only about politics, but about matters concerning which a government has no peculiar sources of information, and concerning which any man in the streets may know as much and think as justly as the King, namely religion and morals. Men are never so likely to settle a question rightly as when they discuss it freely. A government can interfere in discussion only by making it less free than it would otherwise be. Men are most likely to form just opinions when they have no other wish than to know the truth, and are exempt from all influence, either of hope or fear. Government, as government, can bring nothing but the influence of hopes and fears to support its doctrines. It carries on controversy, not with reasons, but with threats and bribes. If it employs reasons, it does so, not in virtue of any powers which belong to it as a government. Thus, instead of a contest between argument and argument, we have a contest between argument and force. Instead of a contest in which truth, from the natural constitution of the human mind, has a decided advantage over falsehood, we have a contest in which truth can be victorious only by accident. And what, after all, is the security which this training gives to governments? Mr. Southey would scarcely propose that discussion should be more effectually shackled, that public opinion should be more strictly disciplined into conformity with established institutions, than in Spain and Italy. Yet we know that the restraints which exist in Spain and Italy have not prevented atheism from spreading among the educated classes, and especially among those whose office it is to minister at the altars of God. All our readers know how, at the time of the French Revolution, priest after priest came forward to declare that his doctrine, his ministry, his whole life, had been a lie, a mummery during which he could scarcely compose his countenance sufficiently to carry on the imposture. This was the case of a false, or at least of a grossly corrupted religion. Let us take then the case of all others most favourable to Mr. Southey's argument. Let us take that form of religion which he holds to be the purest, the system of the Arminian part of the Church of England. Let us take the form of government which he most admires and regrets, the government of England in the time of Charles the First. Would he wish to see a closer connection between Church and State than then existed? Would he wish for more powerful ecclesiastical tribunals? for a more zealous King? for a more active primate? Would he wish to see a more complete monopoly of public instruction given to the Established Church? Could any government do more to train the people in the way in which he would have them go? And in what did all this training end? The Report of the state of the Province of Canterbury, delivered by Laud to his master at the close of 1639, represents the Church of England as in the highest and most palmy state. So effectually had the Government pursued that policy which Mr. Southey wishes to see revived that there was scarcely the least appearance of dissent. Most of the bishops stated that all was well among their flocks. Seven or eight persons in the diocese of Peterborough had seemed refractory to the Church, but had made ample submission. In Norfolk and Suffolk all whom there had been reason to suspect had made profession of conformity, and appeared to observe it strictly. It is confessed that there was a little difficulty in bringing some of the vulgar in Suffolk to take the sacrament at the rails in the chancel. This was the only open instance of nonconformity which the vigilant eye of Laud could detect in all the dioceses of his twenty-one suffragans, on the very eve of a revolution in which primate, and Church, and monarch, and monarchy were to perish together. At which time would Mr. Southey pronounce the constitution more secure: in 1639, when Laud presented this Report to Charles; or now, when thousands of meetings openly collect millions of dissenters, when designs against the tithes are openly avowed, when books attacking not only the Establishment, but the first principles of Christianity, are openly sold in the streets? The signs of discontent, he tells us, are stronger in England now than in France when the States-General met: and hence he would have us infer that a revolution like that of France may be at hand. Does he not know that the danger of states is to be estimated, not by what breaks out of the public mind, but by what stays in it? Can he conceive anything more terrible than the situation of a government which rules without apprehension over a people of hypocrites, which is flattered by the press and cursed in the inner chambers, which exults in the attachment and obedience of its subjects, and knows not that those subjects are leagued against it in a free-masonry of hatred, the sign of which is every day conveyed in the glance of ten thousand eyes, the pressure of ten thousand hands, and the tone of ten thousand voices? Profound and ingenious policy! Instead of curing the disease, to remove those symptoms by which alone its nature can be known! To leave the serpent his deadly sting, and deprive him only of his warning rattle! When the people whom Charles had so assiduously trained in the good way had rewarded his paternal care by cutting off his head, a new kind of training came into fashion. Another government arose which, like the former, considered religion as its surest basis, and the religious discipline of the people as its first duty. Sanguinary laws were enacted against libertinism; profane pictures were burned; drapery was put on indecorous statues; the theatres were shut up; fast-days were numerous; and the Parliament resolved that no person should be admitted into any public employment, unless the House should be first satisfied of his vital godliness. We know what was the end of this training. We know that it ended in impiety in filthy and heartless sensuality, in the dissolution of all ties of honour and morality. We know that at this very day scriptural phrases, scriptural names, perhaps some scriptural doctrines excite disgust and ridicule, solely because they are associated with the austerity of that period. Thus has the experiment of training the people in established forms of religion been twice tried in England on a large scale, once by Charles and Laud, and once by the Puritans. The High Tories of our time still entertain many of the feelings and opinions of Charles and Laud, though in a mitigated form; nor is it difficult to see that the heirs of the Puritans are still amongst us. It would be desirable that each of these parties should remember how little advantage or honour it formerly derived from the closest alliance with power, that it fall by the support of rulers and rose by their opposition, that of the two systems that in which the people were at any time drilled was always at that time the unpopular system, that the training of the High Church ended in the reign of the Puritans, and that the training of the Puritans ended in the reign of the harlots. This was quite natural. Nothing is so galling to a people not broken in from the birth as a paternal, or, in other words, a meddling government, a government which tells them what to read, and say, and eat, and drink, and wear. Our fathers could not bear it two hundred year ago; and we are not more patient than they. Mr. Southey thinks that the yoke of the Church is dropping off because it is loose. We feel convinced that it is borne only because it is easy, and that, in the instant in which an attempt is made to tighten it, it will be flung away. It will be neither the first nor the strongest yoke that has been broken asunder and trampled under foot in the day of the vengeance of England. How far Mr. Southey would have the Government carry its measures for training the people in the doctrines of the Church, we are unable to discover. In one passage Sir Thomas More asks with great vehemence, "Is it possible that your laws should suffer the unbelievers to exist as a party? Vetitum est adeo sceleris nihil?" Montesinos answers: "They avow themselves in defiance of the laws. The fashionable doctrine which the press at this time maintains is, that this is a matter in which the laws ought not to interfere, every man having a right, both to form what opinion he pleases upon religious subjects, and to promulgate that opinion." It is clear, therefore, that Mr. Southey would not give full and perfect toleration to infidelity. In another passage, however, he observes with some truth, though too sweepingly, that "any degree of intolerance short of that full extent which the Papal Church exercises where it has the power, acts upon the opinions which it is intended to suppress, like pruning upon vigorous plants; they grow the stronger for it." These two passages, put together, would lead us to the conclusion that, in Mr. Southey's opinion, the utmost severity ever employed by the Roman Catholic Church in the days of its greatest power ought to be employed against unbelievers in England; in plain words, that Carlile and his shopmen ought to be burned in Smithfield, and that every person who, when called upon, should decline to make a solemn profession of Christianity ought to suffer the same fate. We do not, however, believe that Mr. Southey would recommend such a course, though his language would, according to all the rules of logic, justify us in supposing this to be his meaning. His opinions form no system at all. He never sees, at one glance, more of a question than will furnish matter for one flowing and well-turned sentence; so that it would be the height of unfairness to charge him personally with holding a doctrine merely because that doctrine is deducible, though by the closest and most accurate reasoning, from the premises which he has laid down. We are, therefore, left completely in the dark as to Mr. Southey's opinions about toleration. Immediately after censuring the Government for not punishing infidels, he proceeds to discuss the question of the Catholic disabilities, now, thank God, removed, and defends them on the ground that the Catholic doctrines tend to persecution, and that the Catholics persecuted when they had power. "They must persecute," says he, "if they believe their own creed, for conscience-sake; and if they do not believe it, they must persecute for policy; because it is only by intolerance that so corrupt and injurious a system can be upheld." That unbelievers should not be persecuted is an instance of national depravity at which the glorified spirits stand aghast. Yet a sect of Christians is to be excluded from power, because those who formerly held the same opinions were guilty of persecution. We have said that we do not very well know what Mr. Southey's opinion about toleration is. But, on the whole, we take it to be this, that everybody is to tolerate him, and that he is to tolerate nobody. We will not be deterred by any fear of misrepresentation from expressing our hearty approbation of the mild, wise, and eminently Christian manner in which the Church and the Government have lately acted with respect to blasphemous publications. We praise them for not having thought it necessary to encircle a religion pure, merciful, and philosophical, a religion to the evidence of which the highest intellects have yielded, with the defences of a false and bloody superstition. The ark of God was never taken till it was surrounded by the arms of earthly defenders. In captivity, its sanctity was sufficient to vindicate it from insult, and to lay the hostile fiend prostrate on the threshold of his own temple. The real security of Christianity is to be found in its benevolent morality, in its exquisite adaptation to the human heart, in the facility with which its scheme accommodates itself to the capacity of every human intellect, in the consolation which it bears to the house of mourning, in the light with which it brightens the great mystery of the grave. To such a system it can bring no addition of dignity or of strength, that it is part and parcel of the common law. It is not now for the first time left to rely on the force of its own evidences and the attractions of its own beauty. Its sublime theology confounded the Grecian schools in the fair conflict of reason with reason. The bravest and wisest of the Caesars found their arms and their policy unavailing, when opposed to the weapons that were not carnal and the kingdom that was not of this world. The victory which Porphyry and Diocletian failed to gain is not, to all appearance, reserved for any of those who have in this age, directed their attacks against the last restraint of the powerful and the last hope of the wretched. The whole history of Christianity shows, that she is in far greater danger of being corrupted by the alliance of power, than of being crushed by its opposition. Those who thrust temporal sovereignty upon her treat her as their prototypes treated her author. They bow the knee, and spit upon her; they cry "Hail!" and smite her on the cheek; they put a sceptre in her hand, but it is a fragile reed; they crown her, but it is with thorns; they cover with purple the wounds which their own hands have inflicted on her; and inscribe magnificent titles over the cross on which they have fixed her to perish in ignominy and pain. The general view which Mr. Southey takes of the prospects of society is very gloomy; but we comfort ourselves with the consideration that Mr. Southey is no prophet. He foretold, we remember, on the very eve of the abolition of the Test and Corporation Acts, that these hateful laws were immortal, and that pious minds would long be gratified by seeing the most solemn religious rite of the Church profaned for the purpose of upholding her political supremacy. In the book before us, he says that Catholics cannot possibly be admitted into Parliament until those whom Johnson called "the bottomless Whigs" come into power. While the book was in the press, the prophecy was falsified; and a Tory of the Tories, Mr. Southey's own favourite hero, won and wore that noblest wreath, "Ob cives servatos." The signs of the times, Mr. Southey tells us, are very threatening. His fears for the country would decidedly preponderate over his hopes, but for a firm reliance on the mercy of God. Now, as we know that God has once suffered the civilised world to be overrun by savages, and the Christian religion to be corrupted by doctrines which made it, for some ages, almost as bad as Paganism, we cannot think it inconsistent with his attributes that similar calamities should again befal mankind. We look, however, on the state of the world, and of this kingdom in particular, with much greater satisfaction and with better hopes. Mr. Southey speaks with contempt of those who think the savage state happier than the social. On this subject, he says, Rousseau never imposed on him even in his youth. But he conceives that a community which has advanced a little way in civilisation is happier than one which has made greater progress. The Britons in the time of Caesar were happier, he suspects, than the English of the nineteenth century. On the whole, he selects the generation which preceded the Reformation as that in which the people of this country were better off than at any time before or since. This opinion rests on nothing, as far as we can see, except his own individual associations. He is a man of letters; and a life destitute of literary pleasures seems insipid to him. He abhors the spirit of the present generation, the severity of its studies, the boldness of its inquiries, and the disdain with which it regards some old prejudices by which his own mind is held in bondage. He dislikes an utterly unenlightened age; he dislikes an investigating and reforming age. The first twenty years of the sixteenth century would have exactly suited him. They furnished just the quantity of intellectual excitement which he requires. The learned few read and wrote largely. A scholar was held in high estimation. But the rabble did not presume to think; and even the most inquiring and independent of the educated classes paid more reverence to authority, and less to reason, than is usual in our time. This is a state of things in which Mr. Southey would have found himself quite comfortable; and, accordingly, he pronounces it the happiest state of things ever known in the world. The savages were wretched, says Mr. Southey; but the people in the time of Sir Thomas More were happier than either they or we. Now we think it quite certain that we have the advantage over the contemporaries of Sir Thomas More, in every point in which they had any advantage over savages. Mr. Southey does not even pretend to maintain that the people in the sixteenth century were better lodged or clothed than at present. He seems to admit that in these respects there has been some little improvement. It is indeed a matter about which scarcely any doubt can exist in the most perverse mind that the improvements of machinery have lowered the price of manufactured articles, and have brought within the reach of the poorest some conveniences which Sir Thomas More or his master could not have obtained at any price. The labouring classes, however, were, according to Mr. Southey, better fed three hundred years ago than at present. We believe that he is completely in error on this point. The condition of servants in noble and wealthy families, and of scholars at the Universities, must surely have been better in those times than that of day-labourers; and we are sure that it was not better than that of our workhouse paupers. From the household book of the Northumberland family, we find that in one of the greatest establishments of the kingdom the servants lived very much as common sailors live now. In the reign of Edward the Sixth the state of the students at Cambridge is described to us, on the very best authority, as most wretched. Many of them dined on pottage made of a farthing's worth of beef with a little salt and oatmeal, and literally nothing else. This account we have from a contemporary master of St. John's. Our parish poor now eat wheaten bread. In the sixteenth century the labourer was glad to get barley, and was often forced to content himself with poorer fare. In Harrison's introduction to Holinshed we have an account of the state of our working population in the "golden days," as Mr. Southey calls them, "of good Queen Bess." "The gentilitie, "says he, "commonly provide themselves sufficiently of wheat for their own tables, whylest their household and poore neighbours in some shires are inforced to content themselves with rye or barleie; yea, and in time of dearth, many with bread made eyther of beanes, peason, or otes, or of altogether, and some accrues among. I will not say that this extremity is oft so well to be seen in time of plentie as of dearth; but if I should I could easily bring my trial: for albeit there be much more grounde cared nowe almost in everye place then bathe beene of late yeares, yet such a price of corne continueth in eache towne and markete, without any just cause, that the artificer and poore labouring man is not able to reach unto it, but is driven to content him self with horse-corne." We should like to see what the effect would be of putting any parish in England now on allowance of "horse-corne." The helotry of Mammon are not, in our day, so easily enforced to content themselves as the peasantry of that happy period, as Mr. Southey considers it, which elapsed between the fall of the feudal and the rise of the commercial tyranny. "The people," says Mr. Southey, "are worse fed than when they were fishers." And yet in another place he complains that they will not eat fish. "They have contracted," says he, "I know not how, some obstinate prejudice against a kind of food at once wholesome and delicate, and everywhere to be obtained cheaply and in abundance, were the demand for it as general as it ought to be." It is true that the lower orders have an obstinate prejudice against fish. But hunger has no such obstinate prejudices. If what was formerly a common diet is now eaten only in times of severe pressure, the inference is plain. The people must be fed with what they at least think better food than that of their ancestors. The advice and medicine which the poorest labourer can now obtain, in disease, or after an accident, is far superior to what Henry the Eighth could have commanded. Scarcely any part of the country is out of the reach of practitioners, who are probably not so far inferior to Sir Henry Halford as they are superior to Dr. Butts. That there has been a great improvement in this respect, Mr. Southey allows. Indeed he could not well have denied it. "But," says he, "the evils for which these sciences are the palliative, have increased since the time of the Druids, in a proportion that heavily overweighs the benefit of improved therapeutics." We know nothing either of the diseases or the remedies of the Druids. But we are quite sure that the improvement of medicine has far more than kept pace with the increase of disease during the last three centuries. This is proved by the best possible evidence. The term of human life is decidedly longer in England than in any former age, respecting which we possess any information on which we can rely. All the rants in the world about picturesque cottages and temples of Mammon will not shake this argument. No test of the physical well-being of society can be named so decisive as that which is furnished by bills of mortality. That the lives of the people of this country have been gradually lengthening during the course of several generations, is as certain as any fact in statistics; and that the lives of men should become longer and longer, while their bodily condition during life is becoming worse and worse, is utterly incredible. Let our readers think over these circumstances. Let them take into the account the sweating sickness and the plague. Let them take into the account that fearful disease which first made its appearance in the generation to which Mr. Southey assigns the palm of felicity, and raged through Europe with a fury at which the physician stood aghast, and before which the people were swept away by myriads. Let them consider the state of the northern counties, constantly the scene of robberies, rapes, massacres, and conflagrations. Let them add to all this the fact that seventy-two thousand persons suffered death by the hands of the executioner during the reign of Henry the Eighth, and judge between the nineteenth and the sixteenth century. We do not say that the lower orders in England do not suffer severe hardships. But, in spite of Mr. Southey's assertions, and in spite of the assertions of a class of politicians, who, differing from Mr. Southey in every other point, agree with him in this, we are inclined to doubt whether the labouring classes here really suffer greater physical distress than the labouring classes of the most flourishing countries of the Continent. It will scarcely be maintained that the lazzaroni who sleep under the porticoes of Naples, or the beggars who besiege the convents of Spain, are in a happier situation than the English commonalty. The distress which has lately been experienced in the northern part of Germany, one of the best governed and most prosperous regions of Europe, surpasses, if we have been correctly informed, anything which has of late years been known among us. In Norway and Sweden the peasantry are constantly compelled to mix bark. with their bread; and even this expedient has not always preserved whole families and neighbourhoods from perishing together of famine. An experiment has lately been tried in the kingdom of the Netherlands, which has been cited to prove the possibility of establishing agricultural colonies on the waste lands of England, but which proves to our minds nothing so clearly as this, that the rate of subsistence to which the labouring classes are reduced in the Netherlands is miserably low, and very far inferior to that of the English paupers. No distress which the people here have endured for centuries approaches to that which has been felt by the French in our own time. The beginning of the year 1817 was a time of great distress in this island. But the state of the lowest classes here was luxury compared with that of the people of France. We find in Magendie's Journal de Physiologie Experimentale a paper on a point of physiology connected with the distress of that season. It appears that the inhabitants of six departments, Aix, Jura, Doubs, Haute Saone, Vosges, and Saone-et-Loire, were reduced first to oatmeal and potatoes, and at last to nettles, beanstalks, and other kinds of herbage fit only for cattle; that when the next harvest enabled them to eat barley-bread, many of them died from intemperate indulgence in what they thought an exquisite repast; and that a dropsy of a peculiar description was produced by the hard fare of the year. Dead bodies were found on the roads and in the fields. A single surgeon dissected six of these, and found the stomach shrunk, and filled with the unwholesome aliments which hunger had driven men to share with beasts. Such extremity of distress as this is never heard of in England, or even in Ireland. We are, on the whole, inclined to think, though we would speak with diffidence on a point on which it would be rash to pronounce a positive judgment without a much longer and closer investigation than we have bestowed upon it, that the labouring classes of this island, though they have their grievances and distresses, some produced by their own improvidence, some by the errors of their rulers, are on the whole better off as to physical comforts than the inhabitants of an equally extensive district of the old world. For this very reason, suffering is more acutely felt and more loudly bewailed here than elsewhere. We must take into the account the liberty of discussion, and the strong interest which the opponents of a ministry always have, to exaggerate the extent of the public disasters. There are countries in which the people quietly endure distress that here would shake the foundations of the State, countries in which the inhabitants of a whole province turn out to eat grass with less clamour than one Spitalfields weaver would make here, if the overseers were to put him on barley-bread. In those new commonwealths in which a civilised population has at its command a boundless extent of the richest soil, the condition of the labourer is probably happier than in any society which has lasted for many centuries. But in the old world we must confess ourselves unable to find any satisfactory record of any great nation, past or present, in which the working classes have been in a more comfortable situation than in England during the last thirty years. When this island was thinly peopled, it was barbarous: there was little capital; and that little was insecure. It is now the richest and most highly civilised spot in the world; but the population is dense. Thus we have never known that golden age which the lower orders in the United States are now enjoying. We have never known an age of liberty, of order, and of education, an age in which the mechanical sciences were carried to a great height, yet in which the people were not sufficiently numerous to cultivate even the most fertile valleys. But, when we compare our own condition with that of our ancestors, we think it clear that the advantages arising from the progress of civilisation have far more than counterbalanced the disadvantages arising from the progress of population. While our numbers have increased tenfold, our wealth has increased a hundredfold. Though there are so many more people to share the wealth now existing in the country than there were in the sixteenth century, it seems certain that a greater share falls to almost every individual than fell to the share of any of the corresponding class in the sixteenth century. The King keeps a more splendid court. The establishments of the nobles are more magnificent. The esquires are richer; the merchants are richer; the shopkeepers are richer. The serving-man, the artisan, and the husbandman, have a more copious and palatable supply of food, better clothing, and better furniture. This is no reason for tolerating abuses, or for neglecting any means of ameliorating the condition of our poorer countrymen. But it is a reason against telling them, as some of our philosophers are constantly telling them, that they are the most wretched people who ever existed on the face of the earth. We have already adverted to Mr. Southey's amusing doctrine about national wealth. A state, says he, cannot be too rich; but a people may be too rich. His reason for thinking this is extremely curious. "A people may be too rich, because it is the tendency of the commercial, and more especially of the manufacturing system, to collect wealth rather than to diffuse it. Where wealth is necessarily employed in any of the speculations of trade, its increase is in proportion to its amount. Great capitalists become like pikes in a fish-pond who devour the weaker fish; and it is but too certain, that the poverty of one part of the people seems to increase in the same ratio as the riches of another. There are examples of this in history. In Portugal, when the high tide of wealth flowed in from the conquests in Africa and the East, the effect of that great influx was not more visible in the augmented splendour of the court, and the luxury of the higher ranks, than in the distress of the people." Mr. Southey's instance is not a very fortunate one. The wealth which did so little for the Portuguese was not the fruit either of manufactures or of commerce carried on by private individuals. It was the wealth, not of the people, but of the Government and its creatures, of those who, as Mr. Southey thinks, can never be too rich. The fact is, that Mr. Southey's proposition is opposed to all history, and to the phaenomena which surround us on every side. England is the richest country in Europe, the most commercial country, and the country in which manufactures flourish most. Russia and Poland are the poorest countries in Europe. They have scarcely any trade, and none but the rudest manufactures. Is wealth more diffused in Russia and Poland than in England? There are individuals in Russia and Poland whose incomes are probably equal to those of our richest countrymen. It may be doubted whether there are not, in those countries, as many fortunes of eighty thousand a year as here. But are there as many fortunes of two thousand a year, or of one thousand a year? There are parishes in England which contain more people of between three hundred and three thousand pounds a year than could be found in all the dominions of the Emperor Nicholas. The neat and commodious houses which have been built in London and its vicinity, for people of this class, within the last thirty years, would of themselves form a city larger than the capitals of some European kingdoms. And this is the state of society in which the great proprietors have devoured a smaller! The cure which Mr. Southey thinks that he has discovered is worthy of the sagacity which he has shown in detecting the evil. The calamities arising from the collection of wealth in the hands of a few capitalists are to be remedied by collecting it in the hands of one great capitalist, who has no conceivable motive to use it better than other capitalists, the all-devouring State. It is not strange that, differing so widely from Mr. Southey as to the past progress of society, we should differ from him also as to its probable destiny. He thinks, that to all outward appearance, the country is hastening to destruction; but he relies firmly on the goodness of God. We do not see either the piety or the rationality of thus confidently expecting that the Supreme Being will interfere to disturb the common succession of causes and effects. We, too, rely on his goodness, on his goodness as manifested, not in extraordinary interpositions, but in those general laws which it has pleased him to establish in the physical and in the moral world. We rely on the natural tendency of the human intellect to truth, and on the natural tendency of society to improvement. We know no well-authenticated instance of a people which has decidedly retrograded in civilisation and prosperity, except from the influence of violent and terrible calamities, such as those which laid the Roman Empire in ruins, or those which, about the beginning of the sixteenth century, desolated Italy. We know of no country which, at the end of fifty years of peace and tolerably good government, has been less prosperous than at the beginning of that period. The political importance of a state may decline, as the balance of power is disturbed by the introduction of new forces. Thus the influence of Holland and of Spain is much diminished. But are Holland and Spain poorer than formerly? We doubt it. Other countries have outrun them. But we suspect that they have been positively, though not relatively, advancing. We suspect that Holland is richer than when she sent her navies up the Thames, that Spain is richer than when a French king was brought captive to the footstool of Charles the Fifth. History is full of the signs of this natural progress of society. We see in almost every part of the annals of mankind how the industry of individuals, struggling up against wars, taxes, famines, conflagrations, mischievous prohibitions, and more mischievous protections, creates faster than governments can squander, and repairs whatever invaders can destroy. We see the wealth of nations increasing, and all the arts of life approaching nearer and nearer to perfection, in spite of the grossest corruption and the wildest profusion on the part of rulers. The present moment is one of great distress. But how small will that distress appear when we think over the history of the last forty years; a war, compared with which all other wars sink into insignificance; taxation, such as the most heavily taxed people of former times could not have conceived; a debt larger than all the public debts that ever existed in the world added together; the food of the people studiously rendered dear; the currency imprudently debased, and imprudently restored. Yet is the country poorer than in 1790? We firmly believe that, in spite of all the misgovernment of her rulers, she has been almost constantly becoming richer and richer. Now and then there has been a stoppage, now and then a short retrogression; but as to the general tendency there can be no doubt. A single breaker may recede; but the tide is evidently coming in. If we were to prophesy that in the year 1930 a population of fifty millions, better fed, clad, and lodged than the English of our time, will cover these islands, that Sussex and Huntingdonshire will be wealthier than the wealthiest parts of the West Riding of Yorkshire now are, that cultivation, rich as that of a flower-garden, will be carried up to the very tops of Ben Nevis and Helvellyn, that machines constructed on principles yet undiscovered will be in every house, that there will be no highways but railroads, no travelling but by steam, that our debt, vast as it seems to us, will appear to our great- grandchildren a trifling encumbrance, which might easily be paid off in a year or two, many people would think us insane. We prophesy nothing; but this we say: If any person had told the Parliament which met in perplexity and terror after the crash in 1720 that in 1830 the wealth of England would surpass all their wildest dreams, that the annual revenue would equal the principal of that debt which they considered as an intolerable burden, that for one man of ten thousand pounds then living there would be five men of fifty thousand pounds, that London would be twice as large and twice as populous, and that nevertheless the rate of mortality would have diminished to one-half of what it then was, that the post-office would bring more into the exchequer than the excise and customs had brought in together under Charles the Second, that stage coaches would run from London to York in twenty-four hours, that men would be in the habit of sailing without wind, and would be beginning to ride without horses, our ancestors would have given as much credit to the prediction as they gave to Gulliver's Travels. Yet the prediction would have been true; and they would have perceived that it was not altogether absurd, if they had considered that the country was then raising every year a sum which would have purchased the fee- simple of the revenue of the Plantagenets, ten times what supported the Government of Elizabeth, three times what, in the time of Cromwell, had been thought intolerably oppressive. To almost all men the state of things under which they have been used to live seems to be the necessary state of things. We have heard it said that five per cent. is the natural interest of money, that twelve is the natural number of a jury, that forty shillings is the natural qualification of a county voter. Hence it is that, though in every age everybody knows that up to his own time progressive improvement has been taking place, nobody seems to reckon on any improvement during the next generation. We cannot absolutely prove that those are in error who tell us that society has reached a turning point, that we have seen our best days. But so said all who came before us, and with just as much apparent reason. "A million a year will beggar us," said the patriots of 1640. "Two millions a year will grind the country to powder," was the cry in 1660. "Six millions a year, and a debt of fifty millions!" exclaimed Swift, "the high allies have been the ruin of us." "A hundred and forty millions of debt!" said Junius; "well may we say that we owe Lord Chatham more than we shall ever pay, if we owe him such a load as this." "Two hundred and forty millions of debt!" cried all the statesmen of 1783 in chorus; "what abilities, or what economy on the part of a minister, can save a country so burdened?"  We know that if, since 1783, no fresh debt had been incurred, the increased resources of the country would have enabled us to defray that debt at which Pitt, Fox, and Burke stood aghast, nay, to defray it over and over again, and that with much lighter taxation than what we have actually borne. On what principle is it that, when we see nothing but improvement behind us, we are to expect nothing but deterioration before us? It is not by the intermeddling of Mr. Southey's idol, the omniscient and omnipotent State, but by the prudence and energy of the people, that England has hitherto been carried forward in civilisation; and it is to the same prudence and the same energy that we now look with comfort and good hope. Our rulers will best promote the improvement of the nation by strictly confining themselves to their own legitimate duties, by leaving capital to find its most lucrative course, commodities their fair price, industry and intelligence their natural reward, idleness and folly their natural punishment, by maintaining peace, by defending property, by diminishing the price of law, and by observing strict economy in every department of the State. Let the Government do this: the People will assuredly do the rest. CIVIL DISABILITIES OF THE JEWS (January 1831) Statement of the Civil Disabilities and Privations affecting Jews in England. 8vo. London: 1829. THE distinguished member of the House of Commons, who, towards the close of the late Parliament, brought forward a proposition for the relief of the Jews, has given notice of his intention to renew it. The force of reason, in the last session, carried the measure through one stage in spite of the opposition of power. Reason and power are now on the same side; and we have little doubt that they will conjointly achieve a decisive victory. In order to contribute our share to the success of just principles, we propose to pass in review, as rapidly as possible, some of the arguments, or phrases claiming to be arguments, which have been employed to vindicate a system full of absurdity and injustice. The constitution, it is said, is essentially Christian; and therefore to admit Jews to office is to destroy the constitution. Nor is the Jew injured by being excluded from political power. For no man has any right to power. A man has a right to his property; a man has a right to be protected from personal injury. These rights the law allows to the Jew; and with these rights it would be atrocious to interfere. But it is a mere matter of favour to admit any man to political power; and no man can justly complain that he is shut out from it. We cannot but admire the ingenuity of this contrivance for shifting the burden of the proof from those to whom it properly belongs, and who would, we suspect, find it rather cumbersome. Surely no Christian can deny that every human being has a right to be allowed every gratification. which produces no harm to others, and to be spared every mortification which produces no good to others. Is it not a source of mortification to a class of men that they are excluded from political power? If it be, they have, on Christian principles, a right to be freed from that mortification, unless it can be shown that their exclusion is necessary for the averting of some greater evil. The presumption is evidently in favour of toleration. It is for the prosecutor to make out his case. The strange argument which we are considering would prove too much even for those who advance it. If no man has a right to political power, then neither Jew nor Gentile has such a right. The whole foundation of government is taken away. But if government be taken away, the property and the persons of men are insecure; and it is acknowledged that men have a right to their property and to personal security. If it be right that the property of men should be protected, and if this can only be done by means of government, then it must be right that government should exist. Now there cannot be government unless some person or persons possess political power. Therefore it is right that some person or persons should possess political power. That is to say, some person or persons must have a right to political power. It is because men are not in the habit of considering what the end of government is, that Catholic disabilities and Jewish disabilities have been suffered to exist so long. We hear of essentially Protestant governments and essentially Christian governments, words which mean just as much as essentially Protestant cookery, or essentially Christian horsemanship. Government exists for the purpose of keeping the peace, for the purpose of compelling us to settle our disputes by arbitration instead of settling them by blows, for the purpose of compelling us to supply our wants by industry instead of supplying them by rapine. This is the only operation for which the machinery of government is peculiarly adapted, the only operation which wise governments ever propose to themselves as their chief object. If there is any class of people who are not interested, or who do not think themselves interested, in the security of property and the maintenance of order, that class ought to have no share of the powers which exist for the purpose of securing property and maintaining order. But why a man should be less fit to exercise those powers because he wears a beard, because he does not eat ham, because he goes to the synagogue on Saturdays instead of going to the church on Sundays, we cannot conceive. The points of difference between Christianity and Judaism have very much to do with a man's fitness to be a bishop or a rabbi. But they have no more to do with his fitness to be a magistrate, a legislator, or a minister of finance, than with his fitness to be a cobbler. Nobody has ever thought of compelling cobblers to make any declaration on the true faith of a Christian. Any man would rather have his shoes mended by a heretical cobbler than by a person who had subscribed all the thirty-nine articles, but had never handled an awl. Men act thus, not because they are indifferent to religion, but because they do not see what religion has to do with the mending of their shoes. Yet religion has as much to do with the mending of shoes as with the budget and the army estimates. We have surely had several signal proofs within the last twenty years that a very good Christian may be a very bad Chancellor of the Exchequer. But it would be monstrous, says the persecutors, that Jews should legislate for a Christian community. This is a palpable misrepresentation. What is proposed is, not that the Jews should legislate for a Christian community, but that a legislature composed of Christians and Jews should legislate for a community composed of Christians and Jews. On nine hundred and ninety-nine questions out of a thousand, on all questions of police, of finance, of civil and criminal law, of foreign policy, the Jew, as a Jew, has no interest hostile to that of the Christian, or even to that of the Churchman. On questions relating to the ecclesiastical establishment, the Jew and the Churchman may differ. But they cannot differ more widely than the Catholic and the Churchman, or the Independent and the Churchman. The principle that Churchmen ought to monopolise the whole power of the State would at least have an intelligible meaning. The principle that Christians ought to monopolise it has no meaning at all. For no question connected with the ecclesiastical institutions of the country can possibly come before Parliament, with respect to which there will not be as wide a difference between Christians as there can be between any Christian and any Jew. In fact the Jews are not now excluded from political power. They possess it; and as long as they are allowed to accumulate large fortunes, they must possess it. The distinction which is sometimes made between civil privileges and political power is a distinction without a difference. Privileges are power. Civil and political are synonymous words, the one derived from the Latin, the other from the Greek. Nor is this mere verbal quibbling. If we look for a moment at the facts of the case, we shall see that the things are inseparable, or rather identical. That a Jew should be a judge in a Christian country would be most shocking. But he may be a juryman. He may try issues of fact; and no harm is done. But if he should be suffered to try issues of law, there is an end of the constitution. He may sit in a box plainly dressed, and return verdicts. But that he should sit on the bench in a black gown and white wig, and grant new trials, would be an abomination not to be thought of among baptized people. The distinction is certainly most philosophical. What power in civilised society is so great as that of the creditor over the debtor? If we take this away from the Jew, we take away from him the security of his property. If we leave it to him, we leave to him a power more despotic by far than that of the King and all his Cabinet. It would be impious to let a Jew sit in Parliament. But a Jew may make money; and money may make members of Parliament. Gatton and Old Sarum may be the property of a Hebrew. An elector of Penryn will take ten pounds from Shylock rather than nine pounds nineteen shillings and eleven-pence three farthings from Antonio. To this no objection is made. That a Jew should possess the substance of legislative power, that he should command eight votes on every division as if he were the great Duke of Newcastle himself, is exactly as it should be. But that he should pass the bar and sit down on those mysterious, cushions of green leather, that he should cry "hear" and "order," and talk about being on his legs, and being, for one, free to say this and to say that, would be a profanation sufficient to bring ruin on the country. That a Jew should be privy-councillor to a Christian king would be an eternal disgrace to the nation. But the Jew may govern the money-market, and the money-market may govern the world. The Minister may be in doubt as to his scheme of finance till he has been closeted with the Jew. A congress of sovereigns may be forced to summon the Jew to their assistance. The scrawl of the Jew on the back of a piece of paper may be worth more than the royal word of three kings, or the national faith of three new American republics. But that he should put Right Honourable before his name would be the most frightful of national calamities. It was in this way that some of our politicians reasoned about the Irish Catholics. The Catholics ought to have no political power. The sun of England is set for ever if the Catholics exercise political power. Give the Catholics everything else; but keep political power from them. These wise men did not see that, when everything else had been given, political power had been given. They continued to repeat their cuckoo song, when it was no longer a question whether Catholics should have political power or not, when a Catholic association bearded the Parliament, when a Catholic agitator exercised infinitely more authority than the Lord Lieutenant. If it is our duty as Christians to exclude the Jews from political power, it must be our duty to treat them as our ancestors treated them, to murder them, and banish them, and rob them. For in that way, and in that way alone, can we really deprive them of political power. If we do not adopt this course, we may take away the shadow, but we must leave them the substance. We may do enough to pain and irritate them; but we shall not do enough to secure ourselves from danger, if danger really exists. Where wealth is, there power must inevitably be. The English Jews, we are told, are not Englishmen. They are a separate people, living locally in this island, but living morally and politically in communion with their brethren who are scattered over all the world. An English Jew looks on a Dutch or a Portuguese Jew as his countryman, and on an English Christian as a stranger. This want of patriotic feeling, it is said, renders a Jew unfit to exercise political functions. The argument has in it something plausible; but a close examination shows it to be quite unsound. Even if the alleged facts are admitted, still the Jews are not the only people who have preferred their sect to their country. The feeling of patriotism, when society is in a healthful state springs up, by a natural and inevitable association, in the minds of citizens who know that they owe all their comforts and pleasures to the bond which unites them in one community. But, under a partial and oppressive Government, these associations cannot acquire that strength which they have in a better state of things. Men are compelled to seek from their party that protection which they ought to receive from their country, and they, by a natural consequence, transfer to their party that affection which they would otherwise have felt for their country. The Huguenots of France called in the help of England against their Catholic kings. The Catholics of France called in the help of Spain against a Huguenot king. Would it be fair to infer, that at present the French Protestants would wish to see their religion made dominant by the help of a Prussian or an English army? Surely not, and why is it that they are not willing, as they formerly were willing, to sacrifice the interests of their country to the interests of their religious persuasion? The reason is obvious: they were persecuted then, and are not persecuted now. The English Puritans, under Charles the First, prevailed on the Scotch to invade England. Do the Protestant Dissenters of our time wish to see the Church put down by an invasion of foreign Calvinists? If not, to what cause are we to attribute the change? Surely to this, that the Protestant Dissenters are far better treated now than in the seventeenth century. Some of the most illustrious public men that England ever produced were inclined to take refuge from the tyranny of Laud in North America. Was this because Presbyterians and Independents are incapable of loving their country? But it is idle to multiply instances. Nothing is so offensive to a man who knows anything of history or of human nature as to hear those who exercise the powers of government accuse any sect of foreign attachments. If there be any proposition universally true in politics it is this, that foreign attachments are the fruit of domestic misrule. It has always been the trick of bigots to make their subjects miserable at home, and then to complain that they look for relief abroad; to divide society, and to wonder that it is not united; to govern as if a section of the State were the whole, and to censure the other sections of the State for their want of patriotic spirit. If the Jews have not felt towards England like children, it is because she has treated them like a step-mother. There is no feeling which more certainly develops itself in the minds of men living under tolerably good government than the feeling of patriotism. Since the beginning of the world, there never was any nation, or any large portion of any nation, not cruelly oppressed, which was wholly destitute of that feeling. To make it therefore ground of accusation against a class of men, that they are not patriotic, is the most vulgar legerdemain of sophistry. It is the logic which the wolf employs against the lamb. It is to accuse the mouth of the stream of poisoning the source. If the English Jews really felt a deadly hatred to England, if the weekly prayer of their synagogues were that all the curses denounced by Ezekiel on Tyre and Egypt might fall on London, if, in their solemn feasts, they called down blessings on those who should dash their children to pieces on the stones, still, we say, their hatred to their countrymen would not be more intense than that which sects of Christians have often borne to each other. But in fact the feeling of the Jews is not such. It is precisely what, in the situation in which they are placed, we should expect it to be. They are treated far better than the French Protestants were treated in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, or than our Puritans were treated in the time of Laud. They, therefore, have no rancour against the Government or against their countrymen. It will not be denied that they are far better affected to the State than the followers of Coligni or Vane. But they are not so well treated as the dissecting sects of Christians are now treated in England; and on this account, and, we firmly believe, on this account alone, they have a more exclusive spirit. Till we have carried the experiment further, we are not entitled to conclude that they cannot be made Englishmen altogether. The statesman who treats them as aliens, and then abuses them for not entertaining all the feelings of natives, is as unreasonable as the tyrant who punished their fathers for not making bricks without straw. Rulers must not be suffered thus to absolve themselves of their solemn responsibility. It does not lie in their mouths to say that a sect is not patriotic. It is their business to make it patriotic. History and reason clearly indicate the means. The English Jews are, as far as we can see, precisely what our Government has made them. They are precisely what any sect, what any class of men, treated as they have been treated, would have been. If all the red-haired people in Europe had, during centuries, been outraged and oppressed, banished from this place, imprisoned in that, deprived of their money, deprived of their teeth, convicted of the most improbable crimes on the feeblest evidence, dragged at horses' tails, hanged, tortured, burned alive, if, when manners became milder, they had still been subject to debasing restrictions and exposed to vulgar insults, locked up in particular streets in some countries, pelted and ducked by the rabble in others, excluded everywhere from magistracies and honours, what would be the patriotism of gentlemen with red hair? And if, under such circumstances, a proposition were made for admitting red-haired men to office, how striking a speech might an eloquent admirer of our old institutions deliver against so revolutionary a measure! "These men," he might say, "scarcely consider themselves as Englishmen. They think a red-haired Frenchman or a red-haired German more closely connected with them than a man with brown hair born in their own parish. If a foreign sovereign patronises red hair, they love him better than their own native king. They are not Englishmen: they cannot be Englishmen: nature has forbidden it: experience proves it to be impossible. Right to political power they have none; for no man has a right to political power. Let them enjoy personal security; let their property be under the protection of the law. But if they ask for leave to exercise power over a community of which they are only half members, a community the constitution of which is essentially dark-haired, let us answer them in the words of our wise ancestors, Nolumus leges Angliae mutari." But, it is said, the Scriptures declare that the Jews are to be restored to their own country; and the whole nation looks forward to that restoration. They are, therefore, not so deeply interested as others in the prosperity of England. It is not their home, but merely the place of their sojourn, the house of their bondage. This argument, which first appeared in the Times newspaper, and which has attracted a degree of attention proportioned not so much to its own intrinsic force as to the general talent with which that journal is conducted, belongs to a class of sophisms by which the most hateful persecutions may easily be justified. To charge men with practical consequences which they themselves deny is disingenuous in controversy; it is atrocious in government. The doctrine of predestination, in the opinion of many people, tends to make those who hold it utterly immoral. And certainly it would seem that a man who believes his eternal destiny to be already irrevocably fixed is likely to indulge his passions without restraint and to neglect his religious duties. If he is an heir of wrath, his exertions must be unavailing. If he is preordained to life, they must be superfluous. But would it be wise to punish every man who holds the higher doctrines of Calvinism, as if he had actually committed all those crimes which we know some Antinomians to have committed? Assuredly not. The fact notoriously is that there are many Calvinists as moral in their conduct as any Arminian, and many Arminians as loose as any Calvinist. It is altogether impossible to reason from the opinions which a man professes to his feelings and his actions; and in fact no person is ever such a fool as to reason thus, except when he wants a pretext for persecuting his neighbours. A Christian is commanded, under the strongest sanctions, to be just in all his dealings. Yet to how many of the twenty-four millions of professing Christians in these islands would any man in his senses lend a thousand pounds without security? A man who should act, for one day, on the supposition that all the people about him were influenced by the religion which they professed, would find himself ruined before night; and no man ever does act on that supposition in any of the ordinary concerns of life, in borrowing, in lending, in buying, or in selling. But when any of our fellow-creatures are to be oppressed, the case is different. Then we represent those motives which we know to be so feeble for good as omnipotent for evil. Then we lay to the charge of our victims all the vices and follies to which their doctrines, however remotely, seem to tend. We forget that the same weakness, the same laxity, the same disposition to prefer the present to the future, which make men worse than a good religion, make them better than a bad one. It was in this way that our ancestors reasoned, and that some people in our time still reason, about the Catholics. A Papist believes himself bound to obey the Pope. The Pope has issued a bull deposing Queen Elizabeth. Therefore every Papist will treat her grace as an usurper. Therefore every Papist is a traitor. Therefore every Papist ought to be hanged, drawn, and quartered. To this logic we owe some of the most hateful laws that ever disgraced our history. Surely the answer lies on the surface. The Church of Rome may have commanded these men to treat the queen as an usurper. But she has commanded them to do many other things which they have never done. She enjoins her priests to observe strict purity. You are always taunting them with their licentiousness. She commands all her followers to fast often, to be charitable to the poor, to take no interest for money, to fight no duels, to see no plays. Do they obey these injunctions? If it be the fact that very few of them strictly observe her precepts, when her precepts are opposed to their passions and interests, may not loyalty, may not humanity, may not the love of ease, may not the fear of death, be sufficient to prevent them from executing those wicked orders which the Church of Rome has issued against the sovereign of England? When we know that many of these people do not care enough for their religion to go without beef on a Friday for it, why should we think that they will run the risk of being racked and hanged for it? People are now reasoning about the Jews as our fathers reasoned about the Papists. The law which is inscribed on the walls of the synagogues prohibits covetousness. But if we were to say that a Jew mortgagee would not foreclose because God had commanded him not to covet his neighbour's house, everybody would think us out of our wits. Yet it passes for an argument to say that a Jew will take no interest in the prosperity of the country in which he lives, that he will not care how bad its laws and police may be, how heavily it may be taxed, how often it may be conquered and given up to spoil, because God has promised that, by some unknown means, and at some undetermined time, perhaps ten thousand years hence, the Jews shall migrate to Palestine. Is not this the most profound ignorance of human nature? Do we not know that what is remote and indefinite affects men far less than what is near and certain? The argument too applies to Christians as strongly as to Jews. The Christian believes as well as the Jew, that at some future period the present order of things will come to an end. Nay, many Christians believe that the Messiah will shortly establish a kingdom on the earth, and reign visibly over all its inhabitants. Whether this doctrine be orthodox or not we shall not here inquire. The number of people who hold it is very much greater than the number of Jews residing in England. Many of those who hold it are distinguished by rank, wealth, and ability. It is preached from pulpits, both of the Scottish and of the English Church. Noblemen and members of Parliament have written in defence of it. Now wherein does this doctrine differ, as far as its political tendency is concerned, from the doctrine of the Jews? If a Jew is unfit to legislate for us because he believes that he or his remote descendants will be removed to Palestine, can we safely open the House of Commons to a fifth-monarchy man, who expects that before this generation shall pass away, all the kingdoms of the earth will be swallowed up in one divine empire? Does a Jew engage less eagerly than a Christian in any competition which the law leaves open to him? Is he less active and regular in his business than his neighbours? Does he furnish his house meanly, because he is a pilgrim and sojourner in the land? Does the expectation of being restored to the country of his fathers make him insensible to the fluctuations of the stock- exchange? Does he, in arranging his private affairs, ever take into the account the chance of his migrating to Palestine? If not, why are we to suppose that feelings which never influence his dealings as a merchant, or his dispositions as a testator, will acquire a boundless influence over him as soon as he becomes a magistrate or a legislator? There is another argument which we would not willingly treat with levity, and which yet we scarcely know how to treat seriously. Scripture, it is said, is full of terrible denunciations against the Jews. It is foretold that they are to be wanderers. Is it then right to give them a home? It is foretold they are to be oppressed. Can we with propriety suffer them to be rulers? To admit them to the rights of citizens is manifestly to insult the Divine oracles. We allow that to falsify a prophecy inspired by Divine Wisdom would be a most atrocious crime. It is, therefore, a happy circumstance for our frail species, that it is a crime which no man can possibly commit. If we admit the Jews to seats in Parliament, we shall, by so doing, prove that the prophecies in question, whatever they may mean, do not mean that the Jews shall be excluded from Parliament. In fact it is already clear that the prophecies do not bear the meaning put upon them by the respectable persons whom we are now answering. In France and in the United States the Jews are already admitted to all the rights of citizens. A prophecy, therefore, which should mean that the Jews would never, during the course of their wanderings, be admitted to all the rights of citizens in the places of their sojourn, would be a false prophecy. This, therefore, is not the meaning of the prophecies of Scripture. But we protest altogether against the practice of confounding prophecy with precept, of setting up predictions which are often obscure against a morality which is always clear. If actions are to be considered as just and good merely because they have been predicted, what action was ever more laudable than that crime which our bigots are now, at the end of eighteen centuries, urging us to avenge on the Jews, that crime which made the earth shake and blotted out the sun from heaven? The same reasoning which is now employed to vindicate the disabilities imposed on our Hebrew countrymen will equally vindicate the kiss of Judas and the judgment of Pilate. "The Son of man goeth, as it is written of him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed." And woe to those who, in any age, or in any country, disobey His benevolent commands under pretence of accomplishing His predictions. If this argument justifies the laws now existing against the Jews, it justifies equally all the cruelties which have ever been committed against them, the sweeping edicts of banishment and confiscation, the dungeon, the rack, and the slow fire. How can we excuse ourselves for leaving property to people who are to "serve their enemies in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things"; for giving protection to the persons of those who are to "fear day and night, and to have none assurance of their life"; for not seizing on the children of a race whose "sons and daughters are to be given unto another people"? We have not so learned the doctrines of Him who commanded us to love our neighbour as ourselves, and who, when He was called upon to explain what He meant by a neighbour, selected as an example a heretic and an alien. Last year, we remember, it was represented by a pious writer in the John Bull newspaper, and by some other equally fervid Christians, as a monstrous indecency, that the measure for the relief of the Jews should be brought forward in Passion week. One of these humorists ironically recommended that it should be read a second time on Good Friday. We should have had no objection; nor do we believe that the day could be commemorated in a more worthy manner. We know of no day fitter for terminating long hostilities, and repairing cruel wrongs, than the day on which the religion of mercy was founded. We know of no day fitter for blotting out from the statute-book the last traces of intolerance than the day on which the spirit of intolerance produced the foulest of all judicial murders, the day on which the list of the victims of intolerance, that noble list wherein Socrates and More are enrolled, was glorified by a yet greater and holier name. GLADSTONE ON CHURCH AND STATE (April 1839) The state in its Relations with the church. By W. E. GLADSTONE, Esq. Student of Christ Church, and M.P. for Newark. 8vo. Second Edition. London: 1839. THE author of this volume is a young man of unblemished character, and of distinguished parliamentary talents, the rising hope of those stern and unbending Tories who follow, reluctantly and mutinously, a leader whose experience and eloquence are indispensable to them, but whose cautious temper and moderate opinions they abhor. It would not be at all strange if Mr. Gladstone were one of the most unpopular men in England. But we believe that we do him no more than justice when we say that his abilities and his demeanour have obtained for him the respect and goodwill of all parties. His first appearance in the character of an author is therefore an interesting event; and it is natural that the gentle wishes of the public should go with him to his trial. We are much pleased, without any reference to the soundness or unsoundness of Mr. Gladstone's theories, to see a grave and elaborate treatise on an important part of the Philosophy of Government proceed from the pen of a young man who is rising to eminence in the House of Commons. There is little danger that people engaged in the conflicts of active life will be too much addicted to general speculation. The opposite vice is that which most easily besets them. The times and tides of business and debate tarry for no man. A politician must often talk and act before he has thought and read. He may be very ill informed respecting a question; all his notions about it may be vague and inaccurate; but speak he must; and if he is a man of ability, of tact, and of intrepidity, he soon finds that, even under such circumstances, it is possible to speak successfully. He finds that there is a great difference between the effect of written words, which are perused and reperused in the stillness of the closet, and the effect of spoken words which, set off by the graces of utterance and gesture, vibrate for a single moment on the ear. He finds that he may blunder without much chance of being detected, that he may reason sophistically, and escape unrefuted. He finds that, even on knotty questions of trade and legislation, he can, without reading ten pages, or thinking ten minutes, draw forth loud plaudits, and sit down with the credit of having made an excellent speech. Lysias, says Plutarch, wrote a defence for a man who was to be tried before one of the Athenian tribunals. Long before the defendant had learned the speech by heart, he became so much dissatisfied with it that he went in great distress to the author. "I was delighted with your speech the first time I read it; but 1 liked it less the second time, and still less the third time; and now it seems to me to be no defence at all." "My good friend," says Lysias, "you quite forget that the judges are to hear it only once." The case is the same in the English Parliament. It would be as idle in an orator to waste deep meditation and long research on his speeches, as it would be in the manager of a theatre to adorn all the crowd of courtiers and ladies who cross over the stage in a procession with real pearls and diamonds. It is not by accuracy or profundity that men become the masters of great assemblies. And why be at the charge of providing logic of the best quality, when a very inferior article will be equally acceptable? Why go as deep into a question as Burke, only in order to be, like Burke, coughed down, or left speaking to green benches and red boxes? This has long appeared to us to be the most serious of the evils which are to be set off against the many blessings of popular government. It is a fine and true saying of Bacon, that reading makes a full man, talking a ready man, and writing an exact man. The tendency of institutions like those of England is to encourage readiness in public men, at the expense both of fulness and of exactness. The keenest and most vigorous minds of every generation, minds often admirably fitted for the investigation of truth, are habitually employed in producing arguments such as no man of sense would ever put into a treatise intended for publication, arguments which are just good enough to be used once, when aided by fluent delivery and pointed language. The habit of discussing questions in this way necessarily reacts on the intellects of our ablest men, particularly of those who are introduced into Parliament at a very early age, before their minds have expanded to full maturity. The talent for debate is developed in such men to a degree which, to the multitude, seems as marvellous as the performance of an Italian Improvisatore. But they are fortunate indeed if they retain unimpaired the faculties which are required for close reasoning or for enlarged speculation. Indeed we should sooner expect a great original work on political science, such a work, for example, as the Wealth of Nations, from an apothecary in a country town, or from a minister in the Hebrides, than from a statesman who, ever since he was one-and-twenty, had been a distinguished debater in the House of Commons. We therefore hail with pleasure, though assuredly not with unmixed pleasure, the appearance of this work. That a young politician should, in the intervals afforded by his parliamentary avocations, have constructed and propounded, with much study and mental toil, an original theory on a great problem in politics, is a circumstance which, abstracted from all consideration of the soundness or unsoundness of his opinions, must be considered as highly creditable to him. We certainly cannot wish that Mr. Gladstone's doctrines may become fashionable among public men. But we heartily wish that his laudable desire to penetrate beneath the surface of questions, and to arrive, by long and intent meditation, at the knowledge of great general laws, were much more fashionable than we at all expect it to become. Mr. Gladstone seems to us to be, in many respects, exceedingly well qualified for philosophical investigation. His mind is of large grasp; nor is he deficient in dialectical skill. But he does not give his intellect fair play. There is no want of light, but a great want of what Bacon would have called dry light. Whatever Mr. Gladstone sees is refracted and distorted by a false medium of passions and prejudices. His style bears a remarkable analogy to his mode of thinking, and indeed exercises great influence on his mode of thinking. His rhetoric, though often good of its kind, darkens and perplexes the logic which it should illustrate. Half his acuteness and diligence, with a barren imagination and a scanty vocabulary, would have saved him from almost all his mistakes. He has one gift most dangerous to a speculator, a vast command of a kind of language, grave and majestic, but of vague and uncertain import; of a kind of language which affects us much in the same way in which the lofty diction of the Chorus of Clouds affected the simple-hearted Athenian: O ge ton phthegmatos os ieron, kai semnon, kai teratodes. When propositions have been established, and nothing remains but to amplify and decorate them, this dim magnificence may be in place. But if it is admitted into a demonstration, it is very much worse than absolute nonsense; just as that transparent haze, through which the sailor sees capes and mountains of false sizes and in false bearings, is more dangerous than utter darkness. Now, Mr. Gladstone is fond of employing the phraseology of which we speak in those parts of his works which require the utmost perspicuity and precision of which human language is capable; and in this way he deludes first himself, and then his readers. The foundations of his theory, which ought to be buttresses of adamant, are made out of the flimsy materials which are fit only for perorations. This fault is one which no subsequent care or industry can correct. The more strictly Mr. Gladstone reasons on his premises, the more absurd are the conclusions which he brings out; and, when at last his good sense and good nature recoil from the horrible practical inferences to which this theory leads, he is reduced sometimes to take refuge in arguments inconsistent with his fundamental doctrines, and sometimes to escape from the legitimate consequences of his false principles, under cover of equally false history. It would be unjust not to say that this book, though not a good book, shows more talent than many good books. It abounds with eloquent and ingenious passages. It bears the signs of much patient thought. It is written throughout with excellent taste and excellent temper; nor does it, so far as we have observed, contain one expression unworthy of a gentleman, a scholar, or a Christian. But the doctrines which are put forth in it appear to us, after full and calm consideration, to be false, to be in the highest degree pernicious, and to be such as, if followed out in practice to their legitimate consequences, would inevitably produce the dissolution of society; and for this opinion we shall proceed to give our reasons with that freedom which the importance of the subject requires, and which Mr. Gladstone, both by precept and by example, invites us to use, but, we hope, without rudeness, and, we are sure, without malevolence. Before we enter on an examination of this theory, we wish to guard ourselves against one misconception. It is possible that some persons who have read Mr. Gladstone's book carelessly, and others who have merely heard in conversation, or seen in a newspaper, that the member for Newark has written in defence of the Church of England against the supporters of the voluntary system, may imagine that we are writing in defence of the voluntary system, and that we desire the abolition of the Established Church. This is not the case. It would be as unjust to accuse us of attacking the Church, because we attack Mr. Gladstone's doctrines, as it would be to accuse Locke of wishing for anarchy, because he refuted Filmer's patriarchal theory of government, or to accuse Blackstone of recommending the confiscation of ecclesiastical property, because he denied that the right of the rector to tithe was derived from the Levitical law. It is to be observed, that Mr. Gladstone rests his case on entirely new grounds, and does not differ more widely from us than from some of those who have hitherto been considered as the most illustrious champions of the Church. He is not content with the Ecclesiastical Polity, and rejoices that the latter part of that celebrated work "does not carry with it the weight of Hooker's plenary authority." He is not content with Bishop Warburton's Alliance of Church and State. "The propositions of that work generally," he says, "are to be received with qualification"; and he agrees with Bolingbroke in thinking that Warburton's whole theory rests on a fiction. He is still less satisfied with Paley's defence of the Church, which he pronounces to be "tainted by the original vice of false ethical principles, and full of the seeds of evil." He conceives that Dr. Chalmers has taken a partial view of the subject, and "put forth much questionable matter." In truth, on almost every point on which we are opposed to Mr. Gladstone, we have on our side the authority of some divine, eminent as a defender of existing establishments. Mr. Gladstone's whole theory rests on this great fundamental proposition, that the propagation of religious truth is one of the principal ends of government, as government. If Mr. Gladstone has not proved this proposition, his system vanishes at once. We are desirous, before we enter on the discussion of this important question, to point out clearly a distinction which, though very obvious, seems to be overlooked by many excellent people. In their opinion, to say that the ends of government are temporal and not spiritual is tantamount to saying that the temporal welfare of man is of more importance than his spiritual welfare. But this is an entire mistake. The question is not whether spiritual interests be or be not superior in importance to temporal interests; but whether the machinery which happens at any moment to be employed for the purpose of protecting certain temporal interests of a society be necessarily such a machinery as is fitted to promote the spiritual interests of that society. Without a division of labour the world could not go on. It is of very much more importance that men should have food than that they should have pianofortes. Yet it by no means follows that every pianoforte maker ought to add the business of a baker to his own; for, if he did so, we should have both much worse music and much worse bread. It is of much more importance that the knowledge of religious truth should be wisely diffused than that the art of sculpture should flourish among us. Yet it by no means follows that the Royal Academy ought to unite with its present functions those of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, to distribute theological tracts, to send forth missionaries, to turn out Nollekens for being a Catholic, Bacon for being a Methodist, and Flaxman for being a Swedenborgian. For the effect of such folly would be that we should have the worst possible Academy of Arts, and the worst possible Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge. The community, it is plain, would be thrown into universal confusion, if it were supposed to be the duty of every association which is formed for one good object to promote every other good object. As to some of the ends of civil government, all people are agreed. That it is designed to protect our persons and our property; that it is designed to compel us to satisfy our wants, not by rapine, but by industry; that it is designed to compel us to decide our differences, not by the strong hand, but by arbitration; that it is designed to direct our whole force, as that of one man, against any other society which may offer us injury; these are propositions which will hardly be disputed. Now these are matters in which man, without any reference to any higher being, or to any future state, is very deeply interested. Every human being, be he idolater, Mahometan, Jew, Papist, Socinian, Deist, or Atheist, naturally loves life, shrinks from pain, desires comforts which can be enjoyed only in communities where property is secure. To be murdered, to be tortured, to be robbed, to be sold into slavery, these are evidently evils from which men of every religion, and men of no religion, wish to be protected; and therefore it will hardly be disputed that men of every religion, and of no religion, have thus far a common interest in being well governed. But the hopes and fears of man are not limited to this short life and to this visible world. He finds himself surrounded by the signs of a power and wisdom higher than his own; and, in all ages and nations, men of all orders of intellect, from Bacon and Newton, down to the rudest tribes of cannibals, have believed in the existence of some superior mind. Thus far the voice of mankind is almost unanimous. But whether there be one God, or many, what may be God's natural and what His moral attributes, in what relation His creatures stand to Him, whether He have ever disclosed Himself to us by any other revelation than that which is written in all the parts of the glorious and well-ordered world which He has made, whether His revelation be contained in any permanent record, how that record should be interpreted, and whether it have pleased Him to appoint any unerring interpreter on earth, these are questions respecting which there exists the widest diversity of opinion, and respecting some of which a large part of our race has, ever since the dawn of regular history, been deplorably in error. Now here are two great objects: one is the protection of the persons and estates of citizens from injury; the other is the propagation of religious truth. No two objects more entirely distinct can well be imagined. The former belongs wholly to the visible and tangible world in which we live; the latter belongs to that higher world which is beyond the reach of our senses. The former belongs to this life; the latter to that which is to come. Men who are perfectly agreed as to the importance of the former object, and as to the way of obtaining it, differ as widely as possible respecting the latter object. We must, therefore, pause before we admit that the persons, be they who they may, who are intrusted with power for the promotion of the former object, ought always to use that power for the promotion of the latter object. Mr. Gladstone conceives that the duties of governments are paternal; a doctrine which we shall not believe till he can show us some government which loves its subjects as a father loves a child, and which is as superior in intelligence to its subjects as a father is to a child. He tells us in lofty though somewhat indistinct language, that "Government occupies in moral the place of to pan in physical science." If government be indeed to pan in moral science, we do not understand why rulers should not assume all the functions which Plato assigned to them. Why should they not take away the child from the mother, select the nurse, regulate the school, overlook the playground, fix the hours of labour and of recreation, prescribe what ballads shall be sung, what tunes shall be played, what books shall be read, what physic shall be swallowed? Why should not they choose our wives, limit our expenses, and stint us to a certain number of dishes of meat, of glasses of wine, and of cups of tea? Plato, whose hardihood in speculation was perhaps more wonderful than any other peculiarity of his extraordinary mind, and who shrank from nothing to which his principles led, went this whole length. Mr. Gladstone is not so intrepid. He contents himself with laying down this proposition, that whatever be the body which in any community is employed to protect the persons and property of men, that body ought also, in its corporate capacity, to profess a religion, to employ its power for the propagation of that religion, and to require conformity to that religion, as an indispensable qualification for all civil office. He distinctly declares that he does not in this proposition confine his view to orthodox governments or even to Christian governments. The circumstance that a religion is false does not, he tells us, diminish the obligation of governors, as such, to uphold it. If they neglect to do so, "we cannot," he says, "but regard the fact as aggravating the case of the holders of such creed." "I do not scruple to affirm," he adds, "that if a Mahometan conscientiously believes his religion to come from God, and to teach divine truth, he must believe that truth to be beneficial, and beneficial beyond all other things to the soul of man; and he must therefore, and ought to desire its extension, and to use for its extension all proper and legitimate means; and that, if such Mahometan be a prince, he ought to count among those means the application of whatever influence or funds he may lawfully have at his disposal for such purposes." Surely this is a hard saying. Before we admit that the Emperor Julian, in employing the influence and the funds at his disposal for the extinction of Christianity, was doing no more than his duty, before we admit that the Arian Theodoric would have committed a crime if he had suffered a single believer in the divinity of Christ to hold any civil employment in Italy, before we admit that the Dutch Government is bound to exclude from office all members of the Church of England, the King of Bavaria to exclude from office all Protestants, the Great Turk to exclude from office all Christians, the King of Ava to exclude from office all who hold the unity of God, we think ourselves entitled to demand very full and accurate demonstration. When the consequences of a doctrine are so startling, we may well require that its foundations shall be very solid. The following paragraph is a specimen of the arguments by which Mr. Gladstone has, as he conceives, established his great fundamental proposition: We may state the same proposition in a more general form, in which it surely must command universal assent. Wherever there is power in the universe, that power is the property of God, the King of that universe--his property of right, however for a time withholden or abused. Now this property is, as it were, realised, is used according to the will of the owner, when it is used for the purposes he has ordained, and in the temper of mercy, justice, truth, and faith which he has taught us. But those principles never can be truly, never can be permanently entertained in the human breast, except by a continual reference to their source, and the supply of the Divine grace. The powers, therefore, that dwell in individuals acting as a government as well as those that dwell in individuals acting for themselves, can only he secured for right uses by applying to them a religion." Here are propositions of vast and indefinite extent, conveyed in language which has a certain obscure dignity and sagacity, attractive, we doubt not, to many minds. But the moment that we examine these propositions closely, the moment that we bring them to the test by running over but a very few of the particulars which are included in them, we find them to be false and extravagant. The doctrine which "must surely command universal assent" is this, that every association of human beings which exercises any power whatever, that is to say, every association of human beings, is bound, as such association, to profess a religion. Imagine the effect which would follow if this principle were really in force during four-and-twenty hours. Take one instance out of a million. A stage-coach company has power over its horses. This power is the property of God. It is used according to the will of God when it is used with mercy. But the principle of mercy can never be truly or permanently entertained in the human breast without continual reference to God. The powers, therefore, that dwell in individuals, acting as a stage- coach company, can only be secured for right uses by applying to them a religion. Every stage coach company ought, therefore, in its collective capacity, to profess some one faith, to have its articles, and its public worship, and its tests. That this conclusion, and an infinite number of other conclusions equally strange, follow of necessity from Mr. Gladstone's principle, is as certain as it is that two and two make four. And, if the legitimate conclusions be so absurd, there must be something unsound in the principle. We will quote another passage of the same sort: "Why, then, we now come to ask, should the governing body in a state profess a religion? First, because it is composed of individual men; and they, being appointed to act in a definite moral capacity, must sanctify their acts done in that capacity by the offices of religion; inasmuch as the acts cannot otherwise be acceptable to God, or anything but sinful and punishable in themselves. And whenever we turn our face away from God in our conduct, we are living atheistically. . . . In fulfilment, then, of his obligations as an individual, the statesman must be a worshipping man. But his acts are public--the powers and instruments with which he works are public--acting under and by the authority of the law, he moves at his word ten thousand subject arms; and because such energies are thus essentially public, and wholly out of the range of mere individual agency, they must be sanctified not only by the private personal prayers and piety of those who fill public situations, but also by public acts of the men composing the public body. They must offer prayer and praise in their public and collective character--in that character wherein they constitute the organ of the nation, and wield its collective force. Wherever there is a reasoning agency there is a moral duty and responsibility involved in it. The governors are reasoning agents for the nation, in their conjoint acts as such. And therefore there must be attached to this agency, as that without which none of our responsibilities can be met, a religion. And this religion must be that of the conscience of the governor, or none." Here again we find propositions of vast sweep, and of sound so orthodox and solemn that many good people, we doubt not, have been greatly edified by it. But let us examine the words closely; and it will immediately become plain that, if these principles be once admitted, there is an end of all society. No combination can be formed for any purpose of mutual help, for trade, for public works, for the relief of the sick or the poor, for the promotion of art or science, unless the members of the combination agree in their theological opinions. Take any such combination at random, the London and Birmingham Railway Company for example, and observe to what consequences Mr. Gladstone's arguments inevitably lead. Why should the Directors of the Railway Company, in their collective capacity, profess a religion? First, because the direction is composed of individual men appointed to act in a definite moral capacity, bound to look carefully to the property, the limbs, and the lives of their fellow-creatures, bound to act diligently for their constituents, bound to govern their servants with humanity and justice, bound to fulfil with fidelity many important contracts. They must, therefore, sanctify their acts by the offices of religion, or these acts will be sinful and punishable in themselves. In fulfilment, then, of his obligations as an individual, the Director of the London and Birmingham Railway Company must be a worshipping man, But his acts are public. He acts for a body. He moves at his word ten thousand subject arms. And because these energies are out of the range of his mere individual agency, they must be sanctified by public acts of devotion. The Railway Directors must offer prayer and praise in their public and collective character, in that character wherewith they constitute the organ of the Company, and wield its collective power. Wherever there is reasoning agency, there is moral responsibility. The Directors are reasoning agents for the Company, and therefore there must be attached to this agency, as that without which none of our responsibilities can be met, a religion. And this religion must be that of the conscience of the Director himself, or none. There must be public worship and a test. No Jew, no Socinian, no Presbyterian, no Catholic, no Quaker, must, be permitted to be the organ of the Company, and to wield its collected force." Would Mr. Gladstone really defend this proposition? We are sure that he would not; but we are sure that to this proposition, and to innumerable similar propositions, his reasoning inevitably leads. Again "National will and agency are indisputably one, binding either a dissentient minority or the subject body, in a manner that nothing but the recognition of the doctrine of national personality can justify. National honour and good faith are words in every one's mouth. How do they less imply a personality in nations than the duty towards God, for which we now contend? They are strictly and essentially distinct from the honour and good faith of the individuals composing the nation. France is a person to us, and we to her. A wilful injury done to her is a moral act, and a moral act quite distinct from the acts of all the individuals composing the nation. Upon broad facts like these we may rest, without resorting to the more technical proof which the laws afford in their manner of dealing with corporations. If, then, a nation have unity of will, have pervading sympathies, have capability of reward and suffering contingent upon its acts, shall we deny its responsibility; its need of a religion to meet that responsibility? . . A nation, then, having a personality, lies under the obligation, like the individuals composing its governing body, of sanctifying the acts of that personality by the offices of religion, and thus we have a new and imperative ground for the existence of a state religion." A new ground we have here, certainly, but whether very imperative may be doubted. Is it not perfectly clear, that this argument applies with exactly as much force to every combination of human beings for a common purpose, as to governments? Is there any such combination in the world, whether technically a corporation or not, which has not this collective personality, from which Mr. Gladstone deduces such extraordinary consequences? Look at banks, insurance offices, dock companies, canal companies, gas companies, hospitals, dispensaries, associations for the relief of the poor, associations for apprehending malefactors, associations of medical pupils for procuring subjects, associations of country gentlemen for keeping fox-hounds, book societies, benefit societies, clubs of all ranks, from those which have lined Pall-Mall and St. James's Street with their palaces, down to the Free-and-easy which meets in the shabby parlour of a village inn. Is there a single one of these combinations to which Mr. Gladstone's argument will not apply as well as to the State? In all these combinations, in the Bank of England, for example, or in the Athenaeum club, the will and agency of the society are one, and bind the dissentient minority. The Bank and the Athenaeum have a good faith and a justice different from the good faith and justice of the individual members. The Bank is a person to those who deposit bullion with it. The Athenaeum is a person to the butcher and the wine- merchant. If the Athenaeum keeps money at the Bank, the two societies are as much persons to each other as England and France. Either society may pay its debts honestly; either may try to defraud its creditors; either may increase in prosperity; either may fall into difficulties. If, then, they have this unity of will; if they are capable of doing and suffering good and evil, can we to use Mr. Gladstone's words, "deny their responsibility, or their need of a religion to meet that responsibility?"  Joint-stock banks, therefore, and clubs, "having a personality, lie under the necessity of sanctifying that personality by the offices of religion;" and thus we have "a new and imperative ground" for requiring all the directors and clerks of joint-stock banks, and all the members of clubs, to qualify by taking the sacrament. The truth is, that Mr. Gladstone has fallen into an error very common among men of less talents than his own. It is not unusual for a person who is eager to prove a particular proposition to assume a major of huge extent, which includes that particular proposition, without ever reflecting that it includes a great deal more. The fatal facility with which Mr. Gladstone multiplies expressions stately and sonorous, but of indeterminate meaning, eminently qualifies him to practise this sleight on himself and on his readers. He lays down broad general doctrines about power, when the only power of which he is thinking is the power of governments, and about conjoint action when the only conjoint action of which he is thinking is the conjoint action of citizens in a state. He first resolves on his conclusion. He then makes a major of most comprehensive dimensions, and having satisfied himself that it contains his conclusion, never troubles himself about what else it may contain: and as soon as we examine it we find that it contains an infinite number of conclusions, every one of which is a monstrous absurdity. It is perfectly true that it would be a very good thing if all the members of all the associations in the world were men of sound religious views. We have no doubt that a good Christian will be under the guidance of Christian principles, in his conduct as director of a canal company or steward of a charity dinner. If he were, to recur to a case which we have before put, a member of a stage-coach company, he would, in that capacity, remember that "a righteous man regardeth the life of his beast." But it does not follow that every association of men must, therefore, as such association, profess a religion. It is evident that many great and useful objects can be attained in this world only by co-operation. It is equally evident that there cannot be efficient co-operation, if men proceed on the principle that they must not co-operate for one object unless they agree about other objects. Nothing seems to us more beautiful or admirable in our social system than the facility with which thousands of people, who perhaps agree only on a single point, can combine their energies for the purpose of carrying that single point. We see daily instances of this. Two men, one of them obstinately prejudiced against missions, the other president of a missionary society, sit together at the board of a hospital, and heartily concur in measures for the health and comfort of the patients. Two men, one of whom is a zealous supporter and the other a zealous opponent of the system pursued in Lancaster's schools, meet at the Mendicity Society, and act together with the utmost cordiality. The general rule we take to be undoubtedly this, that it is lawful and expedient for men to unite in an association for the promotion of a good object, though they may differ with respect to other objects of still higher importance. It will hardly be denied that the security of the persons and property of men is a good object, and that the best way, indeed the only way, of promoting that object, is to combine men together in certain great corporations which are called States. These corporations are very variously, and, for the most part very imperfectly organised. Many of them abound with frightful abuses. But it seems reasonable to believe that the worst that ever existed was, on the whole, preferable to complete anarchy. Now, reasoning from analogy, we should say that these great corporations would, like all other associations, be likely to attain their end most perfectly if that end were kept singly in view: and that to refuse the services of those who are admirably qualified to promote that end, because they are not also qualified to promote some other end, however excellent, seems at first sight as unreasonable as it would be to provide that nobody who was not a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries should be a governor of the Eye Infirmary; or that nobody who was not a member of the Society for Promoting Christianity among the Jews should be a trustee of the Literary Fund. It is impossible to name any collection of human beings to which Mr. Gladstone's reasonings would apply more strongly than to an army. Where shall we find more complete unity of action than in an army? Where else do so many human beings implicitly obey one ruling mind? What other mass is there which moves so much like one man? Where is such tremendous power intrusted to those who command? Where is so awful a responsibility laid upon them? If Mr. Gladstone has made out, as he conceives, an imperative necessity for a State Religion, much more has he made it out to be imperatively necessary that every army should, in its collective capacity, profess a religion. Is he prepared to adopt this consequence? On the morning of the thirteenth of August, in the year 1704, two great captains, equal in authority, united by close private and public ties, but of different creeds, prepared for a battle, on the event of which were staked the liberties of Europe. Marlborough had passed a part of the night in prayer, and before daybreak received the sacrament according to the rites of the Church of England. He then hastened to join Eugene, who had probably just confessed himself to a Popish priest. The generals consulted together, formed their plan in concert, and repaired each to his own post. Marlborough gave orders for public prayers. The English chaplains read the service at the head of the English regiments. The Calvinistic chaplains of the Dutch army, with heads on which hand of Bishop had never been laid, poured forth their supplications in front of their countrymen. In the meantime, the Danes might listen to their Lutheran ministers and Capuchins might encourage the Austrian squadrons, and pray to the Virgin for a blessing on the arms of the Holy Roman Empire. The battle commences. These men of various religions all act like members of one body. The Catholic and the Protestant general exert themselves to assist and to surpass each other. Before sunset the Empire is saved: France has lost in a day the fruits of eighty years of intrigue and of victory: and the allies, after conquering together, return thanks to God separately, each after his own form of worship. Now, is this practical atheism? Would any man in his senses say that, because the allied army had unity of action and a common interest, and because a heavy responsibility lay on its Chiefs, it was therefore imperatively necessary that the Army should, as an Army, have one established religion, that Eugene should be deprived of his command for being a Catholic, that all the Dutch and Austrian colonels should be broken for not subscribing the Thirty-nine Articles? Certainly not. The most ignorant grenadier on the field of battle would have seen the absurdity of such a proposition. "I know," he would have said, "that the Prince of Savoy goes to mass, and that our Corporal John cannot abide it; but what has the mass to do with the taking of the village of Blenheim? The Prince wants to beat the French, and so does Corporal John. If we stand by each other we shall most likely beat them. If we send all the Papists and Dutch away, Tallard will have every man of us." Mr. Gladstone himself, we imagine, would admit that our honest grenadier would have the best of the argument; and if so, what follows? Even this; that all Mr. Gladstone's general principles about power, and responsibility, and personality, and conjoint action, must be given up, and that, if his theory is to stand at all, it must stand on some other foundation. We have now, we conceive, shown that it may be proper to form men into combinations for important purposes, which combinations shall have unity and common interests, and shall be under the direction of rulers intrusted with great power and lying under solemn responsibility, and yet that it may be highly improper that these combinations should, as such, profess any one system of religious belief, or perform any joint act of religious worship. How, then, is it proved that this may not be the case with some of those great combinations which we call States? We firmly believe that it is the case with some States. We firmly believe that there are communities in which it would be as absurd to mix up theology with government, as it would have been in the right wing of the allied army at Blenheim to commence a controversy with the left wing, in the middle of the battle, about purgatory and the worship of images. It is the duty, Mr. Gladstone tells us, of the persons, be they who they may, who hold supreme power in the State, to employ that power in order to promote whatever they may deem to be theological truth. Now, surely, before he can call on us to admit this proposition, he is bound to prove that those persons are likely to do more good than harm by so employing their power. The first question is, whether a government, proposing to itself the propagation of religious truth as one of its principal ends, is more likely to lead the people right than to lead them wrong? Mr. Gladstone evades this question; and perhaps it was his wisest course to do so. "If," says he, "the government be good, let it have its natural duties and powers at its command; but, if not good, let it be made so. . . . We follow, therefore, the true course in looking first for the true idea, or abstract conception of a government, of course with allowance for the evil and frailty that are in man, and then in examining whether there be comprised in that idea a capacity and consequent duty on the part of a government to lay down any laws or devote any means for the purposes of religion,--in short, to exercise a choice upon religion." Of course, Mr. Gladstone has a perfect right to argue any abstract question, provided that he will constantly bear in mind that it is only an abstract question that he is arguing. Whether a perfect government would or would not be a good machinery for the propagation of religious truth is certainly a harmless, and may, for aught we know, be an edifying subject of inquiry. But it is very important that we should remember that there is not, and never has been, any such government in the world. There is no harm at all in inquiring what course a stone thrown into the air would take, if the law of gravitation did not operate. But the consequences would be unpleasant, if the inquirer, as soon as he had finished his calculation, were to begin to throw stones about in all directions, without considering that his conclusion rests on a false hypothesis, and that his projectiles, instead of flying away through infinite space, will speedily return in parabolas, and break the windows and heads of his neighbours. It is very easy to say that governments are good, or if not good, ought to be made so. But what is meant by good government? And how are all the bad governments in the world to be made good? And of what value is a theory which is true only on a supposition in the highest degree extravagant? We do not, however, admit that, if a government were, for all its temporal ends, as perfect as human frailty allows, such a government would, therefore, be necessarily qualified to propagate true religion. For we see that the fitness of governments to propagate true religion is by no means proportioned to their fitness for the temporal end of their institution. Looking at individuals, we see that the princes under whose rule nations have been most ably protected from foreign and domestic disturbance, and have made the most rapid advances in civilisation, have been by no means good teachers of divinity. Take for example, the best French sovereign, Henry the Fourth, a king who restored order, terminated a terrible civil war, brought the finances into an excellent condition, made his country respected throughout Europe, and endeared himself to the great body of the people whom he ruled. Yet this man was twice a Huguenot and twice a Papist. He was, as Davila hints, strongly suspected of having no religion at all in theory, and was certainly not much under religious restraints in his practice. Take the Czar Peter, the Empress Catharine, Frederick the Great. It will surely not be disputed that these sovereigns, with all their faults, were, if we consider them with reference merely to the temporal ends of government, above the average of merit. Considered as theological guides, Mr. Gladstone would probably put them below the most abject drivellers of the Spanish branch of the House of Bourbon. Again, when we pass from individuals to systems, we by no means find that the aptitude of governments for propagating religious truth is proportioned to their aptitude for secular functions. Without being blind admirers either of the French or of the American institutions, we think it clear that the persons and property of citizens are better protected in France and in New England than in almost any society that now exists, or that has ever existed; very much better, certainly, than in the Roman Empire under the orthodox rule of Constantine and Theodosius. But neither the Government of France, nor that of New England, is so organised as to be fit for the propagation of theological doctrines. Nor do we think it improbable that the most serious religious errors might prevail in a state which, considered merely with reference to temporal objects, might approach far nearer than any that has ever been known to the idea of what a state should be. But we shall leave this abstract question, and look at the world as we find it. Does, then, the way in which governments generally obtain their power make it at all probable that they will be more favourable to orthodoxy than to heterodoxy? A nation of barbarians pours down on a rich and unwarlike empire, enslaves the people, portions out the land, and blends the institutions which it finds in the cities with those which it has brought from the woods. A handful of daring adventurers from a civilised nation wander to some savage country, and reduce the aboriginal race to bondage. A successful general turns his arms against the State which he serves. A society made brutal by oppression, rises madly on its masters, sweeps away all old laws and usages, and when its first paroxysm of rage is over, sinks down passively under any form of polity which may spring out of the chaos. A chief of a party, as at Florence, becomes imperceptibly a sovereign, and the founder of a dynasty. A captain of mercenaries, as at Milan, seizes on a city, and by the sword makes himself its ruler. An elective senate, as at Venice, usurps permanent and hereditary power. It is in events such as these that governments have generally originated; and we can see nothing in such events to warrant us in believing that the governments thus called into existence will be peculiarly well fitted to distinguish between religious truth and heresy. When, again, we look at the constitutions of governments which have become settled, we find no great security for the orthodoxy of rulers. One magistrate holds power because his name was drawn out of a purse; another, because his father held it before him. There are representative systems of all sorts, large constituent bodies, small constituent bodies, universal suffrage, high pecuniary qualifications. We see that, for the temporal ends of government, some of these constitutions are very skilfully constructed, and that the very worst of them is preferable to anarchy. We see some sort of connection between the very worst of them and the temporal well-being of society. But it passes our understanding to comprehend what connection any one of them has with theological truth. And how stands the fact? Have not almost all the governments in the world always been in the wrong on religious subjects? Mr. Gladstone, we imagine, would say that, except in the time of Constantine, of Jovian, and of a very few of their successors, and occasionally in England since the Reformation, no government has ever been sincerely friendly to the pure and apostolical Church of Christ. If, therefore, it be true that every ruler is bound in conscience to use his power for the propagation of his own religion, it will follow that, for one ruler who has been bound in conscience to use his power for the propagation of truth, a thousand have been bound in conscience to use their power for the propagation of falsehood. Surely this is a conclusion from which common sense recoils. Surely, if experience shows that a certain machine, when used to produce a certain effect, does not produce that effect once in a thousand times, but produces, in the vast majority of cases, an effect directly contrary, we cannot be wrong in saying that it is not a machine of which the principal end is to be so used. If, indeed, the magistrate would content himself with laying his opinions and reasons before the people, and would leave the people, uncorrupted by hope or fear, to judge for themselves, we should see little reason to apprehend that his interference in favour of error would be seriously prejudicial to the interests of truth. Nor do we, as will hereafter be seen, object to his taking this course, when it is compatible with the efficient discharge of his more especial duties. But this will not satisfy Mr. Gladstone. He would have the magistrate resort to means which have a great tendency to make malcontents, to make hypocrites, to make careless nominal conformists, but no tendency whatever to produce honest and rational conviction. It seems to us quite clear that an inquirer who has no wish except to know the truth is more likely to arrive at the truth than an inquirer who knows that, if he decides one way, he shall be rewarded, and that, if he decides the other way, he shall be punished. Now, Mr. Gladstone would have governments propagate their opinions by excluding all Dissenters from all civil offices. That is to say, he would have governments propagate their opinions by a process which has no reference whatever to the truth or falsehood of those opinions, by arbitrarily uniting certain worldly advantages with one set of doctrines, and certain worldly inconveniences with another set. It is of the very nature of argument to serve the interests of truth; but if rewards and punishments serve the interests of truth, it is by mere accident. It is very much easier to find arguments for the divine authority of the Gospel than for the divine authority of the Koran. But it is just as easy to bribe or rack a Jew into Mahometanism as into Christianity. From racks, indeed, and from all penalties directed against the persons, the property, and the liberty of heretics, the humane spirit of Mr. Gladstone shrinks with horror. He only maintains that conformity to the religion of the State ought to be an indispensable qualification for office; and he would, unless we have greatly misunderstood him, think it his duty, if he had the power, to revive the Test Act, to enforce it rigorously, and to extend it to important classes who were formerly exempt from its operation. This is indeed a legitimate consequence of his principles. But why stop here? Why not roast Dissenters at slow fires? All the general reasonings on which this theory rests evidently lead to sanguinary persecution. If the propagation of religious truth be a principal end of government, as government; if it be the duty of a government to employ for that end its constitutional Power; if the constitutional power of governments extends, as it most unquestionably does, to the making of laws for the burning of heretics; if burning be, as it most assuredly is, in many cases, a most effectual mode of suppressing opinions; why should we not burn? If the relation in which government ought to stand to the people be, as Mr. Gladstone tells us, a paternal relation, we are irresistibly led to the conclusion that persecution is justifiable. For the right of propagating opinions by punishment is one which belongs to parents as clearly as the right to give instruction. A boy is compelled to attend family worship: he is forbidden to read irreligious books: if he will not learn his catechism, he is sent to bed without his supper: if he plays truant at church-time a task is set him. If he should display the precocity of his talents by expressing impious opinions before his brothers and sisters, we should not much blame his father for cutting short the controversy with a horse- whip. All the reasons which lead us to think that parents are peculiarly fitted to conduct the education of their children, and that education is the principal end of a parental relation, lead us also to think that parents ought to be allowed to use punishment, if necessary, for the purpose of forcing children, who are incapable of judging for themselves, to receive religious instruction and to attend religious worship. Why, then, is this prerogative of punishment, so eminently paternal, to be withheld from a paternal government? It seems to us, also, to be the height of absurdity to employ civil disabilities for the propagation of an opinion, and then to shrink from employing other punishments for the same purpose. For nothing can be clearer than that, if you punish at all, you ought to punish enough. The pain caused by punishment is pure unmixed evil, and never ought to be inflicted, except for the sake of some good. It is mere foolish cruelty to provide penalties which torment the criminal without preventing the crime. Now it is possible, by sanguinary persecution unrelentingly inflicted, to suppress opinions. In this way the Albigenses were put down. In this way the Lollards were put down. In this way the fair promise of the Reformation was blighted in Italy and Spain. But we may safely defy Mr. Gladstone to point out a single instance in which the system which he recommends has succeeded. And why should he be so tender-hearted? What reason can he give for hanging a murderer, and suffering a heresiarch to escape without even a pecuniary mulct? Is the heresiarch a less pernicious member of society than the murderer? Is not the loss of one soul a greater evil than the extinction of many lives? And the number of murders committed by the most profligate bravo that ever let out his poniard to hire in Italy, or by the most savage buccaneer that ever prowled on the Windward Station, is small indeed, when compared with the number of souls which have been caught in the snares of one dexterous heresiarch. If, then, the heresiarch causes infinitely greater evils than the murderer, why is he not as proper an object of penal legislation as the murderer? We can give a reason, a reason, short, simple, decisive, and consistent. We do not extenuate the evil which the heresiarch produces; but we say that it is not evil of that sort the sort against which it is the end of government to guard. But how Mr. Gladstone, who considers the evil which the heresiarch produces as evil of the sort against which it is the end of government to guard, can escape from the obvious consequence of his doctrine, we do not understand. The world is full of parallel cases. An orange-woman stops up the pavement with her wheelbarrow; and a policeman takes her into custody. A miser who has amassed a million suffers an old friend and benefactor to die in a workhouse, and cannot be questioned before any tribunal for his baseness and ingratitude. Is this because legislators think the orange-woman's conduct worse than the miser's? Not at all. It is because the stopping up of the pathway is one of the evils against which it is the business of the public authorities to protect society, and heartlessness is not one of those evils. It would be the height of folly to say that the miser ought, indeed, to be punished, but that he ought to be punished less severely than the orange-woman. The heretical Constantius persecutes Athanasius; and why not? Shall Caesar punish the robber who has taken one purse, and spare the wretch who has taught millions to rob the Creator of His honour, and to bestow it on the creature? The orthodox Theodosius persecutes the Arians, and with equal reason. Shall an insult offered to the Caesarean majesty be expiated by death; and shall there be no penalty for him who degrades to the rank of a creature the almighty, the infinite Creator? We have a short answer for both: "To Caesar the things which are Caesar's. Caesar is appointed for the punishment of robbers and rebels. He is not appointed for the purpose of either propagating or exterminating the doctrine of the consubstantiality of the Father and the Son." "Not so," says Mr. Gladstone, "Caesar is bound in conscience to propagate whatever he thinks to be the truth as to this question. Constantius is bound to establish the Arian worship throughout the empire, and to displace the bravest captains of his legions, and the ablest ministers of his treasury, if they hold the Nicene faith. Theodosius is equally bound to turn out every public servant whom his Arian predecessors have put in. But if Constantius lays on Athanasius a fine of a single aureus, if Theodosius imprisons an Arian presbyter for a week, this is most unjustifiable oppression." Our readers will be curious to know how this distinction is made out. The reasons which Mr. Gladstone gives against persecution affecting life, limb, and property, may be divided into two classes; first, reasons which can be called reasons only by extreme courtesy, and which nothing but the most deplorable necessity would ever have induced a man of his abilities to use; and, secondly, reasons which are really reasons, and which have so much force that they not only completely prove his exception, but completely upset his general rule. His artillery on this occasion is composed of two sorts of pieces, pieces which will not go off at all, and pieces which go off with a vengeance, and recoil with most crushing effect upon himself. "We, as fallible creatures," says Mr. Gladstone, "have no right, from any bare speculations of our own to administer pains and penalties to our fellow-creatures, whether on social or religious grounds. We have the right to enforce the laws of the land by such pains and penalties, because it is expressly given by Him who has declared that the civil rulers are to bear the sword for the punishment of evil-doers, and for the encouragement of them that do well. And so, in things spiritual, had it pleased God to give to the Church or the State this power, to be permanently exercised over their members, or mankind at large, we should have the right to use it; but it does not appear to have been so received, and consequently, it should not be exercised." We should be sorry to think that the security of our lives and property from persecution rested on no better ground than this. Is not a teacher of heresy an evil-doer? Has not heresy been condemned in many countries, and in our own among them, by the laws of the land, which, as Mr. Gladstone says, it is justifiable to enforce by penal sanctions? If a heretic is not specially mentioned in the text to which Mr. Gladstone refers, neither is an assassin, a kidnapper, or a highwayman: and if the silence of the New Testament as to all interference of governments to stop the progress of heresy be a reason for not fining or imprisoning heretics, it is surely just as good a reason for not excluding them from office. "God," says Mr. Gladstone, "has seen fit to authorize the employment of force in the one case and not in the other; for it was with regard to chastisement inflicted by the sword for an insult offered to himself that the Redeemer declared his kingdom not to be of this world:-- meaning, apparently in an especial manner, that it should be otherwise than after this world's fashion, in respect to the sanctions by which its laws should be maintained." Now here Mr. Gladstone, quoting from memory, has fallen into an error. The very remarkable words which he cites do not appear to have had any reference to the wound inflicted by Peter on Malchus. They were addressed to Pilate, in answer to the question, "Art thou the King of the Jews?" We can not help saying that we are surprised that Mr. Gladstone should not have more accurately verified a quotation on which, according to him, principally depends the right of a hundred millions of his fellow-subjects, idolaters, Mussulmans, Catholics, and dissenters, to their property, their liberty, and their lives. Mr. Gladstone's humane interpretations of Scripture are lamentably destitute of one recommendation, which he considers as of the highest value: they are by no means in accordance with the general precepts or practice of the Church, from the time when the Christians became strong enough to persecute down to a very recent period. A dogma favourable to toleration is certainly not a dogma quod semper, quod ubique, quod omnibus. Bossuet was able to say, we fear with too much truth, that on one point all Christians had long been unanimous, the right of the civil magistrate to propagate truth by the sword; that even heretics had been orthodox as to this right, and that the Anabaptists and Socinians were the first who called it in question. We will not pretend to say what is the best explanation of the text under consideration; but we are sure that Mr. Gladstone's is the worst. According to him, Government ought to exclude Dissenters from office, but not to fine them, because Christ's kingdom is not of this world. We do not see why the line may not be drawn at a hundred other places as well as that which he has chosen. We do not see why Lord Clarendon, in recommending the act of 1664 against conventicles, might not have said, "It hath been thought by some that this classis of men might with advantage be not only imprisoned but pilloried. But methinks, my Lords, we are inhibited from the punishment of the pillory by that Scripture, 'My kingdom is not of this world."' Archbishop Laud, when he sate on Burton in the Star-Chamber, might have said, "I pronounce for the pillory; and, indeed, I could wish that all such wretches were delivered to the fire, but that our Lord hath said that His kingdom is not of this world." And Gardiner might have written to the Sheriff of Oxfordshire "See that execution be done without fall on Master Ridley and Master Latimer, as you will answer the same to the Queen's grace at your peril. But if they shall desire to have some gunpowder for the shortening of their torment, I see not but you may grant it, as it is written, Regnum meum non est de hoc mundo; that is to say, My kingdom is not of this world." But Mr. Gladstone has other arguments against persecution, arguments which are of so much weight, that they are decisive not only against persecution but against his whole theory. "The Government," he says, "is incompetent to exercise minute and constant supervision over religious opinion." And hence he infers, that "a Government exceeds its province when it comes to adapt a scale of punishments to variations in religious opinion, according to their respective degrees of variation from the established creed. To decline affording countenance to sects is a single and simple rule. To punish their professors, according to their several errors, even were there no other objection, is one for which the State must assume functions wholly ecclesiastical, and for which it is not intrinsically fitted." This is, in our opinion, quite true. But how does it agree with Mr. Gladstone's theory? What! the Government incompetent to exercise even such a degree of supervision over religious opinion as is implied by the punishment of the most deadly heresy! The Government incompetent to measure even the grossest deviations from the standard of truth! The Government not intrinsically qualified to judge of the comparative enormity of any theological errors! The Government so ignorant on these subjects that it is compelled to leave, not merely subtle heresies, discernible only by the eye of a Cyril or a Bucer, but Socinianism, Deism, Mahometanism, Idolatry, Atheism, unpunished! To whom does Mr. Gladstone assign the office of selecting a religion for the State, from among hundreds of religions, every one of which lays claim to truth? Even to this same Government, which is now pronounced to be so unfit for theological investigations that it cannot venture to punish a man for worshipping a lump of stone with a score of heads and hands. We do not remember ever to have fallen in with a more extraordinary instance of inconsistency. When Mr. Gladstone wishes to prove that the Government ought to establish and endow a religion, and to fence it with a Test Act, Government is _to pan_ in the moral world. Those who would confine it to secular ends take a low view of its nature. A religion must be attached to its agency; and this religion must be that of the conscience of the governor, or none. It is for the Governor to decide between Papists and Protestants, Jansenists and Molinists, Arminians and Calvinists, Episcopalians and Presbyterians, Sabellians and Tritheists, Homoousians and Homoiousians, Nestorians and Eutychians, Monothelites and Monophysites, Paedobaptists and Anabaptists. It is for him to rejudge the Acts of Nice and Rimini, of Ephesus and Chalcedon, of Constantinople and St. John Lateran, of Trent and Dort. It is for him to arbitrate between the Greek and the Latin procession, and to determine whether that mysterious filioque shall or shall not have a place in the national creed. When he has made up his mind, he is to tax the whole community in order to pay people to teach his opinion, what ever it may be. He is to rely on his own judgment, though it may be opposed to that of nine-tenths of the society. He is to act on his own judgment, at the risk of exciting the most formidable discontents. He is to inflict, perhaps on a great majority of the population, what, whether we choose to call it persecution or not, will always be felt as persecution by those who suffer it. He is, on account of differences often too slight for vulgar comprehension, to deprive the State of the services of the ablest men. He is to debase and enfeeble the community which he governs, from a nation into a sect. In our own country, for example, millions of Catholics, millions of Protestant Dissenters, are to be excluded from all power and honours. A great hostile fleet is on the sea; but Nelson is not to command in the Channel if in the mystery of the Trinity he confounds the persons. An invading army has landed in Kent; but the Duke of Wellington is not to be at the head of our forces if he divides the substance. And after all this, Mr. Gladstone tells us, that it would be wrong to imprison a Jew, a Mussulman, or a Buddhist, for a day; because really a Government cannot understand these matters, and ought not to meddle with questions which belong to the Church. A singular theologian, indeed, this Government! So learned, that it is competent to exclude Grotius from office for being a Semi-Pelagian, so unlearned that it is incompetent to fine a Hindoo peasant a rupee for going on a pilgrimage to Juggernaut. "To solicit and persuade one another," says Mr. Gladstone, "are privileges which belong to us all; and the wiser and better man is bound to advise the less wise and good; but he is not only not bound, he is not allowed, speaking generally, to coerce him. It is untrue, then, that the same considerations which bind a Government to submit a religion to the free choice of the people would therefore justify their enforcing its adoption." Granted. But it is true that all the same considerations which would justify a Government in propagating a religion by means of civil disabilities would justify the propagating of that religion by penal laws. To solicit! Is it solicitation to tell a Catholic Duke, that he must abjure his religion or walk out of the House of Lords? To persuade! Is it persuasion to tell a barrister of distinguished eloquence and learning that he shall grow old in his stuff gown, while his pupils are seated above him in ermine, because he cannot digest the damnatory clauses of the Athanasian Creed? Would Mr. Gladstone think that a religious system which he considers as false, Socinianism for example, was submitted to his free choice, if it were submitted in these terms?--"If you obstinately adhere to the faith of the Nicene fathers, you shall not be burned in Smithfield; you shall not be sent to Dorchester gaol; you shall not even pay double land-tax. But you shall be shut out from all situations in which you might exercise your talents with honour to yourself and advantage to the country. The House of Commons, the bench of magistracy, are not for such as you. You shall see younger men, your inferiors in station and talents, rise to the highest dignities and attract the gaze of nations, while you are doomed to neglect and obscurity. If you have a son of the highest promise, a son such as other fathers would contemplate with delight, the development of his fine talents and of his generous ambition shall be a torture to you. You shall look on him as a being doomed to lead, as you have led, the abject life of a Roman or a Neapolitan in the midst of a great English people. All those high honours, so much more precious than the most costly gifts of despots, with which a free country decorates its illustrious citizens, shall be to him, as they have been to you, objects not of hope and virtuous emulation, but of hopeless, envious pining. Educate him, if you wish him to feel his degradation. Educate him, if you wish to stimulate his craving for what he never must enjoy. Educate him, if you would imitate the barbarity of that Celtic tyrant who fed his prisoners on salted food till they called eagerly for drink, and then let down an empty cup into the dungeon and left them to die of thirst." Is this to solicit, to persuade, to submit religion to the free choice of man? Would a fine of a thousand pounds, would imprisonment in Newgate for six months, under circumstances not disgraceful, give Mr Gladstone the pain which he would feel, if he were to be told that he was to be dealt with in the way in which he would himself deal with more than one half of his countrymen? We are not at all surprised to find such inconsistency even in a man of Mr. Gladstone's talents. The truth is, that every man is, to a great extent, the creature of the age. It is to no purpose that he resists the influence which the vast mass, in which he is but an atom, must exercise on him. He may try to be a man of the tenth century: but he cannot. Whether he will or not, he must be a man of the nineteenth century. He shares in the motion of the moral as well as in that of the physical world. He can no more be as intolerant as he would have been in the days of the Tudors than he can stand in the evening exactly where he stood in the morning. The globe goes round from west to east; and he must go round with it. When he says that he is where he was, he means only that he has moved at the same rate with all around him. When he says that he has gone a good way to the westward, he means only that he has not gone to the eastward quite so rapidly as his neighbours. Mr. Gladstone's book is, in this respect, a very gratifying performance. It is the measure of what a man can do to be left behind by the world. It is the strenuous effort of a very vigorous mind to keep as far in the rear of the general progress as possible. And yet, with the most intense exertion Mr. Gladstone cannot help being, on some important points, greatly in advance of Locke himself; and, with whatever admiration he may regard Laud, it is well for him, we can tell him, that he did not write in the days of that zealous primate, who would certainly have refuted the expositions of Scripture which we have quoted, by one of the keenest arguments that can be addressed to human ears. This is not the only instance in which Mr. Gladstone has shrunk in a very remarkable manner from the consequences of his own theory. If there be in the whole world a state to which this theory is applicable, that state is the British Empire in India. Even we, who detest paternal governments in general, shall admit that the duties of the Government of India are, to a considerable extent, paternal. There, the superiority of the governors to the governed in moral science is unquestionable. The conversion of the whole people to the worst form that Christianity ever wore in the darkest ages would be a most happy event. It is not necessary that a man should be a Christian to wish for the propagation of Christianity in India. It is sufficient that he should be an European not much below the ordinary European level of good sense and humanity. Compared with the importance of the interests at stake, all those Scotch and Irish questions which occupy so large a portion of Mr. Gladstone's book, sink into insignificance. In no part of the world since the days of Theodosius has so large a heathen population been subject to a Christian government. In no part of the world is heathenism more cruel, more licentious, more fruitful of absurd rites and pernicious laws. Surely, if it be the duty of Government to use its power and its revenue in order to bring seven millions of Irish Catholics over to the Protestant Church, it is a fortiori the duty of the Government to use its power and its revenue in order to make seventy millions of idolaters Christians. If it be a sin to suffer John Howard or William Penn to hold any office in England because they are not in communion with the Established Church, it must be a crying sin indeed to admit to high situations men who bow down, in temples covered with emblems of vice, to the hideous images of sensual or malevolent gods. But no. Orthodoxy, it seems, is more shocked by the priests of Rome than by the priests of Kalee. The plain red brick building, the Cave of Adullam, or Ebenezer Chapel, where uneducated men hear a half-educated man talk of the Christian law of love and the Christian hope of glory, is unworthy of the indulgence which is reserved for the shrine where the Thug suspends a portion of the spoils of murdered travellers, and for the car which grinds its way through the bones of self-immolated pilgrims. "It would be," says Mr. Gladstone, "an absurd exaggeration to maintain it as the part of such a Government as that of the British in India to bring home to the door of every subject at once the ministrations of a new and totally unknown religion." The Government ought indeed to desire to propagate Christianity. But the extent to which they must do so must be "limited by the degree in which the people are found willing to receive it." He proposes no such limitation in the case of Ireland. He would give the Irish a Protestant Church whether they like it or not. "We believe," says he, "that that which we place before them is, whether they know it or not, calculated to be beneficial to them; and that, if they know it not now, they will know it when it is presented to them fairly. Shall we, then, purchase their applause at the expense of their substantial, nay, their spiritual interests?" And why does Mr. Gladstone allow to the Hindoo a privilege which he denies to the Irishman? Why does he reserve his greatest liberality for the most monstrous errors? Why does he pay most respect to the opinion of the least enlightened people? Why does he withhold the right to exercise paternal authority from that one Government which is fitter to exercise paternal authority than any Government that ever existed in the world? We will give the reason in his own words. "In British India," he says, "a small number of persons advanced to a higher grade of civilisation, exercise the powers of government over an immensely greater number of less cultivated persons, not by coercion, but under free stipulation with the governed. Now, the rights of a Government, in circumstances thus peculiar, obviously depend neither upon the unrestricted theory of paternal principles, nor upon any primordial or fictitious contract of indefinite powers, but upon an express and known treaty, matter of positive agreement, not of natural ordinance." Where Mr. Gladstone has seen this treaty we cannot guess for, though he calls it a "known treaty," we will stake our credit that it is quite unknown both at Calcutta and Madras, both in Leadenhall Street and Cannon Row, that it is not to be found in any of the enormous folios of papers relating to India which fill the bookcases of members of Parliament, that it has utterly escaped the researches of all the historians of our Eastern empire, that, in the long and interesting debates of 1813 on the admission of missionaries to India, debates of which the most valuable part has been excellently preserved by the care of the speakers, no allusion to this important instrument is to be found. The truth is that this treaty is a nonentity. It is by coercion, it is by the sword, and not by free stipulation with the governed, that England rule India; nor is England bound by any contract whatever not to deal with Bengal as she deals with Ireland. She may set up a Bishop of Patna, and a Dean of Hoogley; she may grant away the public revenue for the maintenance of prebendaries of Benares and canons of Moorshedabad; she may divide the country into parishes, and place, a rector with a stipend in every one of them; and all this without infringing any positive agreement. If there be such a treaty, Mr. Gladstone can have no difficulty in making known its date, its terms, and, above all the precise extent of the territory within which we have sinfully bound ourselves to be guilty of practical atheism. The last point is of great importance. For, as the provinces of our Indian empire were acquired at different times, and in very different ways, no single treaty, indeed no ten treaties, will justify the system pursued by our Government there. The plain state of the case is this. No man in his senses would dream of applying Mr. Gladstone's theory to India; because, if so applied, it would inevitably destroy our empire, and, with our empire, the best chance of spreading Christianity among the natives. This Mr. Gladstone felt. In some way or other his theory was to be saved, and the monstrous consequences avoided. Of intentional misrepresentation we are quite sure that he is incapable. But we cannot acquit him of that unconscious disingenuousness from which the most upright man, when strongly attached to an opinion, is seldom wholly free. We believe that he recoiled from the ruinous consequences which his system would produce, if tried in India; but that he did not like to say so, lest he should lay himself open to the charge of sacrificing principle to expediency, a word which is held in the utmost abhorrence by all his school. Accordingly, he caught at the notion of a treaty, a notion which must, we think, have originated in some rhetorical expression which he has imperfectly understood. There is one excellent way of avoiding the drawing of a false conclusion from a false major; and that is by having a false minor. Inaccurate history is an admirable corrective of unreasonable theory. And thus it is in the present case. A bad general rule is laid down, and obstinately maintained, wherever the consequences are not too monstrous for human bigotry. But when they become so horrible that even Christ Church shrinks, that even Oriel stands aghast, the rule is evaded by means of a fictitious contract. One imaginary obligation is set up against another. Mr. Gladstone first preaches to Governments the duty of undertaking an enterprise just as rational as the Crusades, and then dispenses them from it on the ground of a treaty which is just as authentic as the donation of Constantine to Pope Sylvester. His system resembles nothing so much as a forged bond with a forged release indorsed on the back of it. With more show of reason he rests the claims of the Scotch Church on a contract. He considers that contract, however, as most unjustifiable, and speaks of the setting up of the Kirk as a disgraceful blot on the reign of William the Third. Surely it would be amusing, if it were not melancholy, to see a man of virtue and abilities unsatisfied with the calamities which one Church, constituted on false principles, has brought upon the empire, and repining that Scotland is not in the same state with Ireland, that no Scottish agitator is raising rent and putting county members in and out, that no Presbyterian association is dividing supreme power with the Government, that no meetings of procursors and repealers are covering the side of the Calton Hill, that twenty-five thousand troops are not required to maintain order on the north of the Tweed, that the anniversary of the Battle of Bothwell Bridge is not regularly celebrated by insult, riot, and murder. We could hardly find a stronger argument against Mr. Gladstone's system than that which Scotland furnishes. The policy which has been followed in that country has been directly opposed to the policy which he recommends. And the consequence is that Scotland, having been one of the rudest, one of the poorest, one of the most turbulent countries in Europe, has become one of the most highly civilised, one of the most flourishing, one of the most tranquil. The atrocities which were of common occurrence: while an unpopular Church was dominant are unknown, In spite of a mutual aversion as bitter as ever separated one people from another, the two kingdoms which compose our island have been indissolubly joined together. Of the ancient national feeling there remains just enough to be ornamental and useful; just enough to inspire the poet, and to kindle a generous and friendly emulation in the bosom of the soldier. But for all the ends of government the nations are one. And why are they so? The answer is simple. The nations are one for all the ends of government, because in their union the true ends of government alone were kept in sight. The nations are one because the Churches are two. Such is the union of England with Scotland, an union which resembles the union of the limbs of one healthful and vigorous body, all moved by one will, all co-operating for common ends. The system of Mr. Gladstone would have produced an union which can be compared only to that which is the subject of a wild Persian fable. King Zohak--we tell the story as Mr. Southey tells it to us--gave the devil leave to kiss his shoulders. Instantly two serpents sprang out, who, in the fury of hunger, attacked his head, and attempted to get at his brain. Zohak pulled them away, and tore them with his nails. But he found that they were inseparable parts of himself, and that what he was lacerating was his own flesh. Perhaps we might be able to find, if we looked round the world, some political union like this, some hideous monster of a state, cursed with one principle of sensation and two principles of volition, self-loathing and self-torturing, made up of parts which are driven by a frantic impulse to inflict mutual pain, yet are doomed to feel whatever they inflict, which are divided by an irreconcileable hatred, Yet are blended in an indissoluble identity. Mr. Gladstone, from his tender concern for Zohak, is unsatisfied because the devil has as yet kissed only one shoulder, because there is not a snake mangling and mangled on the left to keep in countenance his brother on the right. But we must proceed in our examination of his theory. Having, as he conceives, proved that is the duty of every Government to profess some religion or other, right or wrong, and to establish that religion, he then comes to the question what religion a Government ought to prefer; and he decides this question in favour of the form of Christianity established in England. The Church of England is, according to him, the pure Catholic Church of Christ, which possesses the apostolical succession of ministers, and within whose pale is to be found that unity which is essential to truth. For her decisions he claims a degree of reverence far beyond what she has ever, in any of her formularies, claimed for herself; far beyond what the moderate school of Bossuet demands for the Pope; and scarcely short of what that school would ascribe to Pope and General Council together. To separate from her communion is schism. To reject her traditions or interpretations of Scripture is sinful presumption. Mr. Gladstone pronounces the right of private judgment, as it is generally understood throughout Protestant Europe, to be a monstrous abuse. He declares himself favourable, indeed, to the exercise of private judgment, after a fashion of his own. We have, according to him, a right to judge all the doctrines of the Church of England to be sound, but not to judge any of them to be unsound. He has no objection, he assures us, to active inquiry into religious questions. On the contrary, he thinks such inquiry highly desirable, as long as it does not lead to diversity of opinion; which is much the same thing as if he were to recommend the use of fire that will not burn down houses, or of brandy that will not make men drunk. He conceives it to be perfectly possible for mankind to exercise their intellects vigorously and freely on theological subjects, and yet to come to exactly the same conclusions with each other and with the Church of England. And for this opinion he gives, as far as we have been able to discover, no reason whatever, except that everybody who vigorously and freely exercises his understanding on Euclid's Theorems assents to them. "The activity of private judgment," he truly observes, "and the unity and strength of conviction in mathematics vary directly as each other." On this unquestionable fact he constructs a somewhat questionable argument. Everybody who freely inquires agrees, he says, with Euclid. But the Church is as much in the right as Euclid. Why, then, should not every free inquirer agree with the Church? We could put many similar questions. Either the affirmative or the negative of the proposition that King Charles wrote the Icon Basilike is as true as that two sides of a triangle are greater than the third side. Why, then, do Dr. Wordsworth and Mr. Hallam agree in thinking two sides of a triangle greater than the third side, and yet differ about the genuineness of the Icon Basilike? The state of the exact sciences proves, says Mr. Gladstone, that, as respects religion, "the association of these two ideas, activity of inquiry, and variety of conclusion, is a fallacious one." We might just as well turn the argument the other way, and infer from the variety of religious opinions that there must necessarily be hostile mathematical sects, some affirming, and some denying, that the square of the hypothenuse is equal to the squares of the sides. But we do not think either the one analogy or the other of the smallest value. Our way of ascertaining the tendency of free inquiry is simply to open our eyes and look at the world in which we live; and there we see that free inquiry on mathematical subjects produces unity, and that free inquiry on moral subjects produces discrepancy. There would undoubtedly be less discrepancy if inquiries were more diligent and candid. But discrepancy there will be among the most diligent and candid, as long as the constitution of the human mind, and the nature of moral evidence, continue unchanged. That we have not freedom and unity together is a very sad thing; and so it is that we have not wings. But we are just as likely to see the one defect removed as the other. It is not only in religion that this discrepancy is found. It is the same with all matters which depend on moral evidence, with judicial questions, for example, and with political questions. All the judges will work a sum in the rule of three on the same principle, and bring out the same conclusion. But it does not follow that, however honest and laborious they may be, they will all be of one mind on the Douglas case. So it is vain to hope that there may be a free constitution under which every representative will be unanimously elected, and every law unanimously passed; and it would be ridiculous for a statesman to stand wondering and bemoaning himself because people who agree in thinking that two and two make four cannot agree about the new poor law, or the administration of Canada. There are two intelligible and consistent courses which may be followed with respect to the exercise of private judgment; the course of the Romanist, who interdicts private judgment because of its inevitable inconveniences; and the course of the Protestant, who permits private judgment in spite of its inevitable inconveniences. Both are more reasonable than Mr. Gladstone, who would have private judgment without its inevitable inconveniences. The Romanist produces repose by means of stupefaction. The Protestant encourages activity, though he knows that where there is much activity there will be some aberration. Mr. Gladstone wishes for the unity of the fifteenth century with the active and searching spirit of the sixteenth. He might as well wish to be in two places at once. When Mr. Gladstone says that we "actually require discrepancy of opinion--require and demand error, falsehood, blindness, and plume ourselves on such discrepancy as attesting a freedom which is only valuable when used for unity in the truth," he expresses himself with more energy than precision. Nobody loves discrepancy for the sake of discrepancy. But a person who conscientiously believes that free inquiry is, on the whole, beneficial to the interests of truth, and that, from the imperfection of the human faculties, wherever there is much free inquiry there will be some discrepancy, may, without impropriety, consider such discrepancy, though in itself an evil, as a sign of good. That there are ten thousand thieves in London is a very melancholy fact. But, looked at in one point of view, it is a reason for exultation. For what other city could maintain ten thousand thieves? What must be the mass of wealth, where the fragments gleaned by lawless pilfering rise to so large an amount? St. Kilda would not support a single pickpocket. The quantity of theft is, to a certain extent, an index of the quantity of useful industry and judicious speculation. And just as we may, from the great number of rogues in a town, infer that much honest gain is made there; so may we often, from the quantity of error in a community, draw a cheering inference as to the degree in which the public mind is turned to those inquiries which alone can lead to rational convictions of truth. Mr. Gladstone seems to imagine that most Protestants think it possible for the same doctrine to be at once true and false; or that they think it immaterial whether, on a religious question, a man comes to a true or a false conclusion. If there be any Protestants who hold notions so absurd, we abandon them to his censure. The Protestant doctrine touching the right of private judgment, that doctrine which is the common foundation of the Anglican, the Lutheran, and the Calvinistic Churches, that doctrine by which every sect of Dissenters vindicates its separation, we conceive not to be this, that opposite opinions rue; nor this, that truth and falsehood are both may both be true; equally good; nor yet this, that all speculative error is necessarily innocent; but this, that there is on the face of the earth no visible body to whose decrees men are bound to submit their private judgment on points of faith. Is there always such a visible body? Was there such a visible body in the year 1500? If not, why are we to believe that there is such a body in the year 1839? If there was such a body in the year 1500, what was it? Was it the Church of Rome? And how can the Church of England be orthodox now, if the Church of Rome was orthodox then? "In England," says Mr. Gladstone, "the case was widely different from that of the Continent. Her reformation did not destroy, but successfully maintained, the unity and succession of the Church in her apostolical ministry. We have, therefore, still among us the ordained hereditary witnesses of the truth, conveying it to us through an unbroken series from our Lord Jesus Christ and His Apostles. This is to us the ordinary voice of authority; of authority equally reasonable and equally true, whether we will hear, or whether we will forbear." Mr. Gladstone's reasoning is not so clear as might be desired. We have among us, he says, ordained hereditary witnesses of the truth, and their voice is to us the voice of authority. Undoubtedly, if they are witness of the truth, their voice is the voice of authority. But this is little more than saying that the truth is the truth. Nor is truth more true because it comes in an unbroken series from the Apostles. The Nicene faith is not more true in the mouth of the Archbishop of Canterbury, than in that of a Moderator of the General Assembly. If our respect for the authority of the Church is to be only consequent upon our conviction of the truth of her doctrines, we come at once to that monstrous abuse, the Protestant exercise of private judgment. But if Mr. Gladstone means that we ought to believe that the Church of England speaks the truth because she has the apostolical succession, we greatly doubt whether such a doctrine can be maintained. In the first place, what proof have we of the fact? We have, indeed, heard it said that Providence would certainly have interfered to preserve the apostolical succession in the true Church. But this is an argument fitted for understandings of a different kind from Mr. Gladstone's. He will hardly tell us that the Church of England is the true Church because she has the succession; and that she has the succession because she is the true Church. What evidence, then, have we for the fact of the apostolical succession? And here we may easily defend the truth against Oxford with the same arguments with which, in old times, the truth was defended by Oxford against Rome. In this stage of our combat with Mr. Gladstone, we need few weapons except those which we find in the well-furnished and well-ordered armoury of Chillingworth. The transmission of orders from the Apostles to an English clergyman of the present day must have been through a very great number of intermediate persons. Now, it is probable that no clergyman in the Church of England can trace up his spiritual genealogy from bishop to bishop so far back as the time of the Conquest. There remain many centuries during which the history of the transmission of his orders is buried in utter darkness. And whether he be a priest by succession from the Apostles depends on the question, whether during that long period, some thousands of events took place, any one of which may, without any gross improbability, be supposed not to have taken place. We have not a tittle of evidence for any one of these events. We do not even know the names or countries of the men to whom it is taken for granted that these events happened. We do not know whether the spiritual ancestors of any one of our contemporaries were Spanish or Armenian, Arian or Orthodox. In the utter absence of all particular evidence, we are surely entitled to require that there should be very strong evidence indeed that the strictest regularity was observed in every generation, and that episcopal functions were exercised by none who were not bishops by succession from the Apostles. But we have no such evidence. In the first place, we have not full and accurate information touching the polity of the Church during the century which followed the persecution of Nero. That, during this period, the overseers of all the little Christian societies scattered through the Roman empire held their spiritual authority by virtue of holy orders derived from the Apostles, cannot be proved by contemporary testimony, or by any testimony which can be regarded as decisive. The question, whether the primitive ecclesiastical constitution bore a greater resemblance to the Anglican or to the Calvinistic model, has been fiercely disputed. It is a question on which men of eminent parts, learning, and piety have differed, and do to this day differ very widely. It is a question on which at least a full half of the ability and erudition of Protestant Europe has ever since the Reformation, been opposed to the Anglican pretensions. Mr. Gladstone himself, we are persuaded, would have the candour to allow that, if no evidence were admitted but that which is furnished by the genuine Christian literature of the first two centuries, judgment would not go in favour of prelacy. And if he looked at the subject as calmly as he would look at a controversy respecting the Roman Comitia or the Anglo-Saxon Witenagemote, he would probably think that the absence of contemporary evidence during so long a period was a defect which later attestations, however numerous, could but very imperfectly supply. It is surely impolitic to rest the doctrines of the English Church on a historical theory which, to ninety- nine Protestants out of a hundred, would seem much more questionable than any of those doctrines. Nor is this all. Extreme obscurity overhangs the history of the middle ages; and the facts which are discernible through that obscurity prove that the Church was exceedingly ill regulated. We read of sees of the highest dignity openly sold, transferred backwards and forwards by popular tumult, bestowed sometimes by a profligate woman on her paramour, sometimes by a warlike baron on a kinsman still a stripling. We read of bishops of ten years old, of bishops of five years old, of many popes who were mere boys, and who rivalled the frantic dissoluteness of Caligula, nay, of a female pope. And though this last story, once believed throughout all Europe, has been disproved by the strict researches of modern criticism, the most discerning of those who reject it have admitted that it is not intrinsically improbable. In our own island, it was the complaint of Alfred that not a single priest south of the Thames, and very few on the north, could read either Latin or English. And this illiterate clergy exercised their ministry amidst a rude and half-heathen population, in which Danish pirates, unchristened, or christened by the hundred on a field of battle, were mingled with a Saxon peasantry scarcely better instructed in religion. The state of Ireland was still worse. "Tota illa per universam Hiberniam dissolutio, ecclesiasticae disciplinae, illa ubique pro consuetudine Christiana saeva subintroducta barbaries," are the expressions of St. Bernard. We are, therefore, at a loss to conceive how any clergyman can feel confident that his orders have come down correctly. Whether he be really a successor of the Apostles depends on an immense number of such contingencies as these; whether, under King Ethelwolf, a stupid priest might not, while baptizing several scores of Danish prisoners who had just made their option between the font and the gallows, inadvertently omit to perform the rite on one of these graceless proselytes; whether, in the seventh century, an impostor, who had never received consecration, might not have passed himself off as a bishop on a rude tribe of Scots; whether a lad of twelve did really, by a ceremony huddled over when he was too drunk to know what he was about, convey the episcopal character to a lad of ten. Since the first century, not less, in all probability, than a hundred thousand persons have exercised the functions of bishops. That many of these have not been bishops by apostolical succession is quite certain. Hooker admits that deviations from the general rule have been frequent, and with a boldness worthy of his high and statesmanlike intellect, pronounces them to have been often justifiable. "There may be," says he, "sometimes very just and sufficient reason to allow ordination made without a bishop. Where the Church must needs have some ordained, and neither hath nor can have possibly a bishop to ordain, in case of such necessity the ordinary institution of God hath given oftentimes, and may give place. And therefore we are not simply without exception to urge a lineal descent of power from the Apostles by continued succession of bishops in every effectual ordination." There can be little doubt, we think, that the succession, if it ever existed, has often been interrupted in ways much less respectable. For example, let us suppose, and we are sure that no well-informed person will think the supposition by any means improbable, that, in the third century, a man of no principle and some parts, who has, in the course of a roving and discreditable life, been a catechumen at Antioch, and has there become familiar with Christian usages and doctrines afterwards rambles to Marseilles, where he finds a Christian society, rich, liberal, and simple-hearted. He pretends to be a Christian, attracts notice by his abilities and affected zeal, and is raised to the episcopal dignity without having ever been baptized. That such an event might happen, nay, was very likely to happen, cannot well be disputed by any one who has read the Life of Peregrinus. The very virtues, indeed, which distinguished the early Christians, seem to have laid them open to those arts which deceived "Uriel, though Regent of the Sun, and held The sharpest-sighted spirit of all in Heaven." Now this unbaptized impostor is evidently no successor of the Apostles. He is not even a Christian; and all orders derived through such a pretended bishop are altogether invalid. Do we know enough of the state of the world and of the Church in the third century to be able to say with confidence that there were not at that time twenty such pretended bishops? Every such case makes a break in the apostolical succession. Now, suppose that a break, such as Hooker admits to have been both common and justifiable, or such as we have supposed to be produced by hypocrisy and cupidity, were found in the chain which connected the Apostles with any of the missionaries who first spread Christianity in the wilder parts of Europe, who can say how extensive the effect of this single break may be? Suppose that St. Patrick, for example, if ever there was such a man, or Theodore of Tarsus, who is said to have consecrated in the seventh century the first bishops of many English sees, had not the true apostolical orders, is it not conceivable that such a circumstance may affect the orders of many clergymen now living? Even if it were possible, which it assuredly is not, to prove that the Church had the apostolical orders in the third century, it would be impossible to prove that those orders were not in the twelfth century so far lost that no ecclesiastic could be certain of the legitimate descent of his own spiritual character. And if this were so, no subsequent precautions could repair the evil. Chillingworth states the conclusion at which he had arrived on this subject in these very remarkable words: "That of ten thousand probables no one should be false; that of ten thousand requisites, whereof any one may fail, not one should be wanting, this to me is extremely improbable, and even cousin-german to impossible. So that the assurance hereof is like a machine composed of an innumerable multitude of pieces, of which it is strangely unlikely but some will be out of order; and yet, if any one be so, the whole fabric falls of necessity to the ground: and he that shall put them together, and maturely consider all the possible ways of lapsing and nullifying a priesthood in the Church of Rome, will be very inclinable to think that it is a hundred to one, that among a hundred seeming priests, there is not one true one; nay, that it is not a thing very improbable that, amongst those many millions which make up the Romish hierarchy, there are not twenty true." We do not pretend to know to what precise extent the canonists of Oxford agree with those of Rome as to the circumstances which nullify orders. We will not, therefore, go so far as Chillingworth. We only say that we see no satisfactory proof of the fact, that the Church of England possesses the apostolical succession. And, after all, if Mr. Gladstone could prove the apostolical succession, what would the apostolical succession prove? He says that "we have among us the ordained hereditary witnesses of the truth, conveying it to us through an unbroken series from our Lord Jesus Christ and his Apostles." Is this the fact? Is there any doubt that the orders of the Church of England are generally derived from the Church of Rome? Does not the Church of England declare, does not Mr. Gladstone himself admit, that the Church of Rome teaches much error and condemns much truth? And is it not quite clear, that as far as the doctrines of the Church of England differ from those of the Church of Rome, so far the Church of England conveys the truth through a broken series? That the founders, lay and clerical, of the Church of England, corrected all that required correction in the doctrines of the Church of Rome, and nothing more, may be quite true. But we never can admit the circumstance that the Church of England possesses the apostolical succession as a proof that she is thus perfect. No stream can rise higher than its fountain. The succession of ministers in the Church of England, derived as it is through the Church of Rome, can never prove more for the Church of England than it proves for the Church of Rome. But this is not all. The Arian Churches which once predominated in the kingdoms of the Ostrogoths, the Visigoths, the Burgundians, the Vandals, and the Lombards, were all episcopal Churches, and all had a fairer claim than that of England to the apostolical succession, as being much nearer to the apostolical times. In the East, the Greek Church, which is at variance on points of faith with all the Western Churches, has an equal claim to this succession. The Nestorian, the Eutychian, the Jacobite Churches, all heretical, all condemned by councils, of which even Protestant divines have generally spoken with respect, had an equal claim to the apostolical succession. Now if, of teachers having apostolical orders, a vast majority have taught much error, if a large proportion have taught deadly heresy, if on the other hand, as Mr. Gladstone himself admits, Churches not having apostolical orders, that of Scotland for example, have been nearer to the standard of orthodoxy than the majority of teachers who have had apostolical orders, how can he possibly call upon us to submit our private judgment to the authority of a Church on the ground that she has these orders? Mr. Gladstone dwells much on the importance of unity in doctrine. Unity he tells us, is essential to truth. And this is most unquestionable. But when he goes on to tell us that this unity is the characteristic of the Church of England, that she is one in body and in spirit, we are compelled to differ from him widely. The apostolical succession she may or may not have. But unity she most certainly has not, and never has had. It is a matter of perfect notoriety, that her formularies are framed in such a manner as to admit to her highest offices men who differ from each other more widely than a very high Churchman differs from a Catholic, or a very low Churchman from a Presbyterian; and that the general leaning of the Church, with respect to some important questions, has been sometimes one way and sometimes another. Take, for example, the questions agitated between the Calvinists and the Arminians. Do we find in the Church of England, with respect to those questions, that unity which is essential to truth? Was it ever found in the Church? Is it not certain that, at the end of the sixteenth century, the rulers of the Church held doctrines as Calvinistic as ever were held by any Cameronian, and not only held them, but persecuted every body who did not hold them? And is it not equally certain, that the rulers of the Church have, in very recent times, considered Calvinism as a disqualification for high preferment, if not for holy orders? Look at the questions which Archbishop Whitgift propounded to Barret, questions framed in the very spirit of William Huntington, S. S. [One question was, whether God had from eternity reprobated certain persons; and why? The answer which contented the Archbishop was "Affirmative, et quia voluit."] And then look at the eighty-seven questions which Bishop Marsh, within our own memory, propounded to candidates for ordination. We should be loth to say that either of these celebrated prelates had intruded himself into a Church whose doctrines he abhorred, and that he deserved to be stripped of his gown. Yet it is quite certain that one or other of them must have been very greatly in error. John Wesley again, and Cowper's friend, John Newton, were both Presbyters of this Church. Both were men of ability. Both we believe to have been men of rigid integrity, men who would not have subscribed a Confession of Faith which they disbelieved for the richest bishopric in the empire. Yet, on the subject of predestination, Newton was strongly attached to doctrines which Wesley designated as "blasphemy, which might make the ears of a Christian to tingle." Indeed it will not be disputed that the clergy of the Established Church are divided as to these questions, and that her formularies are not found practically to exclude even scrupulously honest men of both sides from her altars. It is notorious that some of her most distinguished rulers think this latitude a good thing, and would be sorry to see it restricted in favour of either opinion. And herein we most cordially agree with them. But what becomes of the unity of the Church, and of that truth to which unity is essential? Mr. Gladstone tells us that the Regium Donum was given originally to orthodox Presbyterian ministers, but that part of it is now received by their heterodox successors. "This," he says, "serves to illustrate the difficulty in which governments entangle themselves, when they covenant with arbitrary systems of opinions, and not with the Church alone. The opinion passes away, but the gift remains." But is it not clear, that if a strong Supralapsarian had, under Whitgift's primacy, left a large estate at the disposal of the bishops for ecclesiastical purposes, in the hope that the rulers of the Church would abide by Whitgift's theology, he would really have been giving his substance for the support of doctrines which he detested? The opinion would have passed away, and the gift would have remained. This is only a single instance. What wide differences of opinion respecting the operation of the sacraments are held by bishops, doctors, presbyters of the Church of England, all men who have conscientiously declared their assent to her articles, all men who are, according to Mr. Gladstone, ordained hereditary witnesses of the truth, all men whose voices make up what, he tells us, is the voice of true and reasonable authority! Here, again, the Church has not unity; and as unity is the essential condition of truth, the Church has not the truth. Nay, take the very question which we are discussing with Mr. Gladstone. To what extent does the Church of England allow of the right of private judgment? What degree of authority does she claim for herself in virtue of the apostolical succession of her ministers? Mr. Gladstone, a very able and a very honest man, takes a view of this matter widely differing from the view taken by others whom he will admit to be as able and as honest as himself. People who altogether dissent from him on this subject eat the bread of the Church, preach in her pulpits, dispense her sacraments, confer her orders, and carry on that apostolical succession, the nature and importance of which, according to him, they do not comprehend. Is this unity? Is this truth? It will be observed that we are not putting cases of dishonest men who, for the sake of lucre, falsely pretend to believe in the doctrines of an establishment.  We are putting cases of men as upright as ever lived, differing on theological questions of the highest importance and avowing that difference, are yet priests and prelates of the same church. We therefore say, that on some points which Mr. Gladstone himself thinks of vital importance, the Church has either not spoken at all, or, what is for all practical purposes the same thing, has not spoken in language to be understood even by honest and sagacious divines. The religion of the Church of England is so far from exhibiting that unity of doctrine which Mr. Gladstone represents as her distinguishing glory, that it is, in fact, a bundle of religious systems without number. It comprises the religious system of Bishop Tomline, and the religious system of John Newton, and all the religious systems which lie between them. It comprises the religious system of Mr. Newman, and the religious system of the Archbishop of Dublin, and all the religious systems which lie between them. All these different opinions are held, avowed, preached, printed, within the pale of the Church, by men of unquestioned integrity and understanding. Do we make this diversity a topic of reproach to the Church of England? Far from it. We would oppose with all our power every attempt to narrow her basis? Would to God that, a hundred and fifty years ago, a good king and a good primate had possessed the power as well as the will to widen it! It was a noble enterprise, worthy of William and of Tillotson. But what becomes of all Mr. Gladstone's eloquent exhortations to unity? Is it not mere mockery to attach so much importance to unity in form and name, where there is so little in substance, to shudder at the thought of two Churches in alliance with one State, and to endure with patience the spectacle of a hundred sects battling within one Church? And is it not clear that Mr. Gladstone is bound, on all his own principles, to abandon the defence of a Church in which unity is not found? Is it not clear that he is bound to divide the House of Commons against every grant of money which may be proposed for the clergy of the Established Church in the colonies? He objects to the vote for Maynooth, because it is monstrous to pay one man to teach truth, and another to denounce that truth as falsehood. But it is a mere chance whether any sum which he votes for the English Church in any colony will go to the maintenance of an Arminian or a Calvinist, of a man like Mr. Froude, or of a man like Dr. Arnold. It is a mere chance, therefore, whether it will go to support a teacher of truth, or one who will denounce that truth as falsehood. This argument seems to us at once to dispose of all that part of Mr. Gladstone's book which respects grants of public money to dissenting bodies. All such grants he condemns. But surely, if it be wrong to give the money of the public for the support of those who teach any false doctrine, it is wrong to give that money for the support of the ministers of the Established Church. For it is quite certain that, whether Calvin or Arminius be in the right, whether Laud or Burnet be in the right, a great deal of false doctrine is taught by the ministers of the Established Church. If it be said that the points on which the clergy of the Church of England differ ought to be passed over, for the sake of the many important points on which they agree, why may not the same argument be maintained with respect to the other sects which hold, in common with the Church of England, the fundamental doctrines of Christianity? The principle that a ruler is bound in conscience to propagate religious truth, and to propagate no religious doctrine which is untrue, is abandoned as soon as it is admitted that a gentleman of Mr. Gladstone's opinions may lawfully vote the public money to a chaplain whose opinions are those of Paley or of Simeon. The whole question then becomes one of degree. Of course no individual and no government can justifiably propagate error for the sake of propagating error. But both individuals and governments must work with such machinery as they have; and no human machinery is to be found which will impart truth without some alloy of error. We have shown irrefragably, as we think, that the Church of England does not afford such a machinery. The question then is this; with what degree of imperfection in our machinery must we put up? And to this question we do not see how any general answer can be given. We must be guided by circumstances. It would, for example, be very criminal in a Protestant to contribute to the sending of Jesuit missionaries among a Protestant population. But we do not conceive that a Protestant would be to blame for giving assistance to Jesuit missionaries who might be engaged in converting the Siamese to Christianity. That tares are mixed with the wheat is matter of regret; but it is better that wheat and tares should grow together than that the promise of the year should be blighted. Mr. Gladstone, we see with deep regret, censures the British Government in India for distributing a small sum among the Catholic priests who minister to the spiritual wants of our Irish soldiers. Now, let us put a case to him. A Protestant gentleman is attended by a Catholic servant, in a part of the country where there is no Catholic congregation within many miles. The servant is taken ill, and is given over. He desires, in great trouble of mind, to receive the last sacraments of his Church. His master sends off a messenger in a chaise and four, with orders to bring a confessor from a town at a considerable distance. Here a Protestant lays out money for the purpose of causing religious instruction and consolation to be given by a Catholic priest. Has he committed a sin? Has he not acted like a good master and a good Christian? Would Mr. Gladstone accuse him of "laxity of religious principle," of "confounding truth with falsehood," of "considering the support of religion as a boon to an individual, not as a homage to truth?" But how if this servant had, for the sake of his master, undertaken a journey which removed him from the place where he might easily have obtained religious attendance? How if his death were occasioned by a wound received in defending his master? Should we not then say that the master had only fulfilled a sacred obligation of duty? Now, Mr. Gladstone himself owns that "nobody can think that the personality of the State is more stringent, or entails stronger obligations, than that of the individual." How then stands the case of the Indian Government? Here is a poor fellow enlisted in Clare or Kerry, sent over fifteen thousand miles of sea, quartered in a depressing and pestilential climate. He fights for the Government; he conquers for it; he is wounded; he is laid on his pallet, withering away with fever, under that terrible sun, without a friend near him. He pines for the consolations of that religion which, neglected perhaps in the season of health and vigour, now comes back to his mind, associated with all the overpowering recollections of his earlier days, and of the home which he is never to see again. And because the State for which he dies sends a priest of his own faith to stand at his bedside, and to tell him, in language which at once commands his love and confidence, of the common Father, of the common Redeemer, of the common hope of immortality, because the State for which he dies does not abandon him in his last moments to the care of heathen attendants, or employ a chaplain of a different creed to vex his departing spirit with a controversy about the Council of Trent, Mr. Gladstone finds that India presents "a melancholy picture," and that there is "a large allowance of false principle" in the system pursued there. Most earnestly do we hope that our remarks may induce Mr. Gladstone to reconsider this part of his work, and may prevent him from expressing in that high assembly, in which he must always be heard with attention, opinions so unworthy of his character. We have now said almost all that we think it necessary to say respecting Mr. Gladstone's theory. And perhaps it would be safest for us to stop here. It is much easier to pull down than to build up. Yet, that we may give Mr. Gladstone his revenge, we will state concisely our own views respecting the alliance of Church and State. We set out in company with Warburton, and remain with him pretty sociably till we come to his contract; a contract which Mr. Gladstone very properly designates as a fiction. We consider the primary end of Government as a purely temporal end, the protection of the persons and property of men. We think that Government, like every other contrivance of human wisdom, from the highest to the lowest, is likely to answer its main end best when it is constructed with a single view to that end. Mr. Gladstone, who loves Plato, will not quarrel with us for illustrating our proposition, after Plato's fashion, from the most familiar objects. Take cutlery, for example. A blade which is designed both to shave and to carve, will certainly not shave so well as a razor, or carve so well as a carving-knife. An academy of painting, which should also be a bank, would, in all probability, exhibit very bad pictures and discount very bad bills. A gas company, which should also be an infant school society, would, we apprehend, light the streets ill, and teach the children ill. On this principle, we think that Government should be organised solely with a view to its main end; and that no part of its efficiency for that end should be sacrificed in order to promote any other end however excellent. But does it follow from hence that Governments ought never to pursue any end other than their main end? In no wise. Though it is desirable that every institution should have a main end, and should be so formed as to be in the highest degree efficient for that main end; yet if, without any sacrifice of its efficiency for that end, it can pursue any other good end, it ought to do so. Thus, the end for which a hospital is built is the relief of the sick, not the beautifying of the street. To sacrifice the health of the sick to splendour of architectural effect, to place the building in a bad air only that it may present a more commanding front to a great public place, to make the wards hotter or cooler than they ought to be, in order that the columns and windows of the exterior may please the passers-by would be monstrous. But if, without any sacrifice of the chief object, the hospital can be made an ornament to the metropolis, it would be absurd not to make it so. In the same manner, if a Government can, without any sacrifice of its main end, promote any other good work, it ought to do so. The encouragement of the fine arts, for example, is by no means the main end of Government; and it would be absurd, in constituting a Government, to bestow a thought on the question, whether it would be a Government likely to train Raphaels or Domenichinos. But it by no means follows that it is improper for a Government to form a national gallery of pictures. The same may be said of patronage bestowed on learned men, of the publication of archives, of the collecting of libraries, menageries, plants, fossils, antiques, of journeys and voyages for purposes of geographical discovery or astronomical observation. It is not for these ends that Government is constituted. But it may well happen that a Government may have at its command resources which will enable it, without any injury to its main end, to pursue these collateral ends far more effectually than any individual or any voluntary association could do. If so, Government ought to pursue these collateral ends. It is still more evidently the duty of Government to promote, always in subordination to its main end, everything which is useful as a means for the attaining of that main end. The improvement of steam navigation, for example, is by no means a primary object of Government. But as steam vessels are useful for the purpose of national defence, and for the purpose of facilitating intercourse between distant provinces, and of thereby consolidating the force of the empire, it may be the bounden duty of Government to encourage ingenious men to perfect an invention which so directly tends to make the State more efficient for its great primary end. Now on both these grounds, the instruction of the people may with propriety engage the care of the Government. That the people should be well educated, is in itself a good thing; and the State ought therefore to promote this object, if it can do so without any sacrifice of its primary object. The education of the people, conducted on those principles of morality which are common to all the forms of Christianity, is highly valuable as a means of promoting the main object for which Government exists, and is on this ground well deserving the attention of rulers. We will not at present go into the general question of education; but will confine our remarks to the subject which is more immediately before us, namely, the religious instruction of the people. We may illustrate our view of the policy which Governments ought to pursue with respect to religious instruction, by recurring to the analogy of a hospital. Religious instruction is not the main end for which a hospital is built; and to introduce into a hospital any regulations prejudicial to the health of the patients, on the plea of promoting their spiritual improvement, to send a ranting preacher to a man who has just been ordered by the physician to lie quiet and try to get a little sleep, to impose a strict observance of Lent on a convalescent who has been advised to eat heartily of nourishing food, to direct, as the bigoted Pius the Fifth actually did, that no medical assistance should be given to any person who declined spiritual attendance, would be the most extravagant folly. Yet it by no means follows that it would not be right to have a chaplain to attend the sick, and to pay such a chaplain out of the hospital funds. Whether it will be proper to have such a chaplain at all, and of what religious persuasion such a chaplain ought to be, must depend on circumstances. There may be a town in which it would be impossible to set up a good hospital without the help of people of different opinions: and religious parties may run so high that, though people of different opinions are willing to contribute for the relief of the sick, they will not concur in the choice of any one chaplain. The High Churchmen insist that, if there is a paid chaplain, he shall be a High Churchman. The Evangelicals stickle for an Evangelical. Here it would evidently be absurd and cruel to let an useful and humane design, about which we are all agreed, fall to the ground, because all cannot agree about something else. The governors must either appoint two chaplains and pay them both; or they must appoint none; and every one of them must, in his individual capacity, do what he can for the purpose of providing the sick with such religious instruction and consolation as will, in his opinion, be most useful to them. We should say the same of Government. Government is not an institution for the propagation of religion, any more than St. George's Hospital is an institution for the propagation of religion: and the most absurd and pernicious consequences would follow, if Government should pursue, as its primary end, that which can never be more than its secondary end, though intrinsically more important than its primary end. But a Government which considers the religious instruction of the people as a secondary end, and follows out that principle faithfully, will, we think, be likely to do much good and little harm. We will rapidly run over some of the consequences to which this principle leads, and point out how it solves some problems which, on Mr. Gladstone's hypothesis, admit of no satisfactory solution. All persecution directed against the persons or property of men is, on our principle, obviously indefensible. For, the protection of the persons and property of men being the primary end of Government and religious instruction only a secondary end, to secure the people from heresy by making their lives, their limbs, or their estates insecure, would be to sacrifice the primary end to the secondary end. It would be as absurd as it would be in the governors of a hospital to direct that the wounds of all Arian and Socinian patients should be dressed in such a way as to make them fester. Again, on our principles, all civil disabilities on account of religious opinions are indefensible. For all such disabilities make Government less efficient for its main end: they limit its choice of able men for the administration and defence of the State; they alienate from it the hearts of the sufferers; they deprive it of a part of its effective strength in all contests with foreign nations. Such a course is as absurd as it would be in the governors of a hospital to reject an able surgeon because he is an Universal Restitutionist, and to send a bungler to operate because he is perfectly orthodox. Again, on our principles, no Government ought to press on the people religious instruction, however sound, in such a manner as to excite among them discontents dangerous to public order. For here again Government would sacrifice its primary end to an end intrinsically indeed of the highest importance, but still only a secondary end of Government, as Government. This rule at once disposes of the difficulty about India, a difficulty of which Mr. Gladstone can get rid only by putting in an imaginary discharge in order to set aside an imaginary obligation. There is assuredly no country where it is more desirable that Christianity should be propagated. But there is no country in which the Government is so completely disqualified for the task. By using our power in order to make proselytes, we should produce the dissolution of society, and bring utter ruin on all those interests for the protection of which Government exists. Here the secondary end is, at present, inconsistent with the primary end, and must therefore be abandoned. Christian instruction given by individuals and voluntary societies may do much good. Given by the Government it would do unmixed harm. At the same time, we quite agree with Mr. Gladstone in thinking that the English authorities in India ought not to participate in any idolatrous rite; and indeed we are fully satisfied that all such participation is not only unchristian, but also unwise and most undignified. Supposing the circumstances of a country to be such, that the Government may with propriety, on our principles, give religious instruction to a people; we have next to inquire, what religion shall be taught. Bishop Warburton answers, the religion of the majority. And we so far agree with him, that we can scarcely conceive any circumstances in which it would be proper to establish, as the one exclusive religion of the State, the religion of the minority. Such a preference could hardly be given without exciting most serious discontent, and endangering those interests, the protection of which is the first object of Government. But we never can admit that a ruler can be justified in helping to spread a system of opinions solely because that system is pleasing to the majority. On the other hand, we cannot agree with Mr. Gladstone, who would of course answer that the only religion which a ruler ought to propagate is the religion of his own conscience. In truth, this is an impossibility. And as we have shown, Mr. Gladstone himself, whenever he supports a grant of money to the Church of England, is really assisting to propagate not the precise religion of his own conscience, but some one or more, he knows not how many or which, of the innumerable religions which lie between the confines of Pelagianism and those of Antinomianism, and between the confines of Popery and those of Presbyterianism. In our opinion, that religious instruction which the ruler ought, in his public capacity, to patronise, is the instruction from which he, in his conscience, believes that the people will learn most good with the smallest mixture of evil. And thus it is not necessarily his own religion that he will select. He will, of course, believe that his own religion is unmixedly good. But the question which he has to consider is, not how much good his religion contains, but how much good the people will learn, if instruction is given them in that religion. He may prefer the doctrines and government of the Church of England to those of the Church of Scotland. But if he knows that a Scotch congregation will listen with deep attention and respect while an Erskine or a Chalmers sets before them the fundamental doctrines of Christianity, and that a glimpse of a surplice or a single line of a liturgy would be the signal for hooting and riot and would probably bring stools and brickbats about the ears of the minister, he acts wisely if he conveys religious knowledge to the Scotch rather by means of that imperfect Church, as he may think it, from which they will learn much, than by means of that perfect Church from which they will learn nothing. The only end of teaching is, that men may learn; and it is idle to talk of the duty of teaching truth in ways which only cause men to cling more firmly to falsehood. On these principles we conceive that a statesman, who might be far indeed from regarding the Church of England with the reverence which Mr. Gladstone feels for her, might yet firmly oppose all attempts to destroy her. Such a statesman may be too well acquainted with her origin to look upon her with superstitious awe. He may know that she sprang from a compromise huddled up between the eager zeal of reformers and the selfishness of greedy, ambitious, and time-serving politicians. He may find in every page of her annals ample cause for censure. He may feel that he could not, with ease to his conscience, subscribe all her articles. He may regret that all the attempts which have been made to open her gates to large classes of nonconformists should have failed. Her episcopal polity he may consider as of purely human institution. He cannot defend her on the ground that she possesses the apostolical succession; for he does not know whether that succession may not be altogether a fable. He cannot defend her on the ground of her unity; for he knows that her frontier sects are much more remote from each other, than one frontier is from the Church of Rome, or the other from the Church of Geneva. But he may think that she teaches more truth with less alloy of error than would be taught by those who, if she were swept away, would occupy the vacant space. He may think that the effect produced by her beautiful services and by her pulpits on the national mind, is, on the whole, highly beneficial. He may think that her civilising influence is usefully felt in remote districts. He may think that, if she were destroyed, a large portion of those who now compose her congregations would neglect all religious duties, and that a still larger portion would fall under the influence of spiritual mountebanks, hungry for gain, or drunk with fanaticism. While he would with pleasure admit that all the qualities of Christian pastors are to be found in large measure within the existing body of Dissenting ministers, he would perhaps be inclined to think that the standard of intellectual and moral character among that exemplary class of men may have been raised to its present high point and maintained there by the indirect influence of the Establishment. And he may be by no means satisfied that, if the Church were at once swept away, the place of our Sumners and Whatelys would be supplied by Doddridges and Halls. He may think that the advantages which we have described are obtained, or might, if the existing system were slightly modified, be obtained, without any sacrifice of the paramount objects which all Governments ought to have chiefly in view. Nay, he may be of opinion that an institution, so deeply fixed in the hearts and minds of millions, could not be subverted without loosening and shaking all the foundations of civil society. With at least equal ease he would find reasons for supporting the Church of Scotland. Nor would he be under the necessity of resorting to any contract to justify the connection of two religious establishments with one Government. He would think scruples on that head frivolous in any person who is zealous for a Church, of which both Dr. Herbert Marsh and Dr. Daniel Wilson have been bishops. Indeed he would gladly follow out his principles much further. He would have been willing to vote in 1825 for Lord Francis Egerton's resolution, that it is expedient to give a public maintenance to the Catholic clergy of Ireland: and he would deeply regret that no such measure was adopted in 1829. In this way, we conceive, a statesman might on our principles satisfy himself that it would be in the highest degree inexpedient to abolish the Church, either of England or of Scotland. But if there were, in any part of the world, a national Church regarded as heretical by four-fifths of the nation committed to its care, a Church established and maintained by the sword, a Church producing twice as many riots as conversions, a Church which, though possessing great wealth and power, and though long backed by persecuting laws, had, in the course of many generations, been found unable to propagate its doctrines, and barely able to maintain its ground, a Church so odious, that fraud and violence, when used against its clear rights of property, were generally regarded as fair play, a Church, whose ministers were preaching to desolate walls, and with difficulty obtaining their lawful subsistence by the help of bayonets, such a Church, on our principles, could not, we must own, be defended. We should say that the State which allied itself with such a Church postponed the primary end of Government to the secondary: and that the consequences had been such as any sagacious observer would have predicted. Neither the primary nor the secondary end is attained. The temporal and spiritual interests of the people suffer alike. The minds of men, instead of being drawn to the Church, are alienated from the State. The magistrate, after sacrificing order, peace, union, all the interests which it is his first duty to protect, for the purpose of promoting pure religion, is forced, after the experience of centuries, to admit that he has really been promoting error. The sounder the doctrines of such a Church, the more absurd and noxious the superstition by which those doctrines are opposed, the stronger are the arguments against the policy which has deprived a good cause of its natural advantages. Those who preach to rulers the duty of employing power to propagate truth would do well to remember that falsehood, though no match for truth alone, has often been found more than a match for truth and power together. A statesman, judging on our principles, would pronounce without hesitation that a Church, such as we have last described, never ought to have been set up. Further than this we will not venture to speak for him. He would doubtless remember that the world is full of institutions which, though they never ought to have been set up, yet, having been set up, ought not to be rudely pulled down; and that it is often wise in practice to be content with the mitigation of an abuse which, looking at it in the abstract, we might feel impatient to destroy. We have done; and nothing remains but that we part from Mr. Gladstone with the courtesy of antagonists who bear no malice. We dissent from his opinions, but we admire his talents; we respect his integrity and benevolence; and we hope that he will not suffer political avocations so entirely to engross him, as to leave him no leisure for literature and philosophy. FRANCIS BACON (July 1837) The Works of Francis Bacon, Lord Chancellor of England. A new Edition. By BASIL MONTAGU, Esq., 16 vols. 8vo. London: 1825-1834. WE return our hearty thanks to Mr. Montagu. for this truly valuable work. From the opinions which he expresses as a biographer we often dissent. But about his merit as a collector of the materials out of which opinions are formed, there can be no dispute; and we readily acknowledge that we are in a great measure indebted to his minute and accurate researches for the means of refuting what we cannot but consider as his errors. The labour which has been bestowed on this volume has been a labour of love. The writer is evidently enamoured of the subject. It fills his heart. It constantly overflows from his lips and his pen. Those who are acquainted with the Courts in which Mr. Montagu practises with so much ability and success well know how often he enlivens the discussion of a point of law by citing some weighty aphorism, or some brilliant illustration, from the De Augmentis or the Novum Organum. The Life before us doubtless owes much of its value to the honest and generous enthusiasm of the writer. This feeling has stimulated his activity, has sustained his perseverance, has called forth all his ingenuity and eloquence; but, on the other hand, we must frankly say that it has, to a great extent, perverted his judgment. We are by no means without sympathy for Mr. Montagu even in what we consider as his weakness. There is scarcely any delusion which has a better claim to be indulgently treated than that under the influence of which a man ascribes every moral excellence to those who have left imperishable monuments of their genius. The causes of this error lie deep in the inmost recesses of human nature. We are all inclined to judge of others as we find them. Our estimate of a character always depends much on the manner in which that character affects our own interests and passions. We find it difficult to think well of those by whom we are thwarted or depressed; and we are ready to admit every excuse for the vices of those who are useful or agreeable to us. This is, we believe, one of those illusions to which the whole human race is subject, and which experience and reflection can only partially remove, It is, in the phraseology of Bacon, one of the idola tribus. Hence it is that the moral character of a man eminent in letters or in the fine arts is treated, often by contemporaries, almost always by posterity, with extraordinary tenderness. The world derives pleasure and advantage from the performances of such a man. The number of those who suffer by his personal vices is small, even in his own time, when compared with the number of those to whom his talents are a source of gratification. In a few years all those whom he has injured disappear. But his works remain, and are a source of delight to millions. The genius of Sallust is still with us. But the Numidians whom he plundered, and the unfortunate husbands who caught him in their houses at unseasonable hours, are forgotten. We suffer ourselves to be delighted by the keenness of Clarendon's observation, and by the sober majesty of his style, till we forget the oppressor and the bigot in the historian. Falstaff and Tom Jones have survived the gamekeepers whom Shakspeare cudgelled and the landladies whom Fielding bilked. A great writer is the friend and benefactor of his readers; and they cannot but judge of him under the deluding influence of friendship and gratitude. We all know how unwilling we are to admit the truth of any disgraceful story about a person whose society we like, and from whom we have received favours; how long we struggle against evidence, how fondly, when the facts cannot be disputed, we cling to the hope that there may be some explanation or some extenuating circumstance with which we are unacquainted. Just such is the feeling which a man of liberal education naturally entertains towards the great minds of former ages. The debt which he owes to them is incalculable. They have guided him to truth. They have filled his mind with noble and graceful images. They have stood by him in all vicissitudes, comforters in sorrow, nurses in sickness, companions in solitude. These friendships are exposed to no danger from the occurrences by which other attachments are weakened or dissolved. Time glides on; fortune is inconstant; tempers are soured; bonds which seemed indissoluble are daily sundered by interest, by emulation, or by caprice. But no such cause can affect the silent converse which we hold with the highest of human intellects. That placid intercourse is disturbed by no jealousies or resentments. These are the old friends who are never seen with new faces, who axe the same in wealth and in poverty, in glory and in obscurity. With the dead there is no rivalry. In the dead there is no change. Plato is never sullen. Cervantes is never petulant. Demosthenes never comes unseasonably. Dante never stays too long. No difference of political opinion can alienate Cicero. No heresy can excite the horror of Bossuet. Nothing, then, can be more natural than that a person endowed with sensibility and imagination should entertain a respectful and affectionate feeling towards those great men with whose minds he holds daily communion. Yet nothing can be more certain than that such men have not always deserved to be regarded with respect or affection. Some writers, whose works will continue to instruct and delight mankind to the remotest ages, have been placed in such situations that their actions and motives are as well known to us as the actions and motives of one human being can be known to another; and unhappily their conduct has not always been such as an impartial judge can contemplate with approbation. But the fanaticism of the devout worshipper of genius is proof against all evidence and all argument. The character of his idol is matter of faith; and the province of faith is not to be invaded by reason. He maintains his superstition with a credulity as boundless, and a zeal as unscrupulous, as can be found in the most ardent partisans of religious or political factions. The most decisive proofs are rejected; the plainest rules of morality are explained away; extensive and important portions of history are completely distorted. The enthusiast misrepresents facts with all the effrontery of an advocate, and confounds right and wrong with all the dexterity of a Jesuit; and all this only in order that some man who has been in his grave during many ages may have a fairer character than he deserves. Middleton's Life of Cicero is a striking instance of the influence of this sort of partiality. Never was there a character which it was easier to read than that of Cicero. Never was there a mind keener or more critical than that of Middleton. Had the biographer brought to the examination of his favourite statesman's conduct but a very small part of the acuteness and severity which he displayed when he was engaged in investigating the high pretensions of Epiphanius and Justin Martyr, he could not have failed to produce a most valuable history of a most interesting portion of time. But this most ingenious and learned man, though                "So wary held and wise That, as 'twas said, he scarce received For gospel what the church believed," had a superstition of his own. The great Iconoclast was himself an idolater. The great Avvocato del Diavolo, while he disputed, with no small ability, the claims of Cyprian and Athanasius to a place in the Calendar, was himself composing a lying legend in honour of St. Tully. He was holding up as a model of every virtue a man whose talents and acquirements, indeed, can never be too highly extolled, and who was by no means destitute of amiable qualities, but whose whole soul was under the dominion of a girlish vanity and a craven fear. Actions for which Cicero himself, the most eloquent and skilful of advocates, could contrive no excuse, actions which in his confidential correspondence he mentioned with remorse and shame, are represented by his biographer as wise, virtuous, heroic. The whole history of that great revolution which overthrew the Roman aristocracy, the whole state of parties, the character of every public man, is elaborately misrepresented, in order to make out something which may look like a defence of one most eloquent and accomplished trimmer. The volume before us reminds us now and then of the Life of Cicero. But there is this marked difference. Dr. Middleton evidently had an uneasy consciousness of the weakness of his cause, and therefore resorted to the most disingenuous shifts, to unpardonable distortions and suppressions of facts. Mr. Montagu's faith is sincere and implicit. He practises no trickery. He conceals nothing. He puts the facts before us in the full confidence that they will produce on our minds the effect which they have produced on his own. It is not till he comes to reason from facts to motives that his partiality shows itself; and then he leaves Middleton himself far behind. His work proceeds on the assumption that Bacon was an eminently virtuous man. From the tree Mr. Montagu judges of the fruit. He is forced to relate many actions which, if any man but Bacon had committed them, nobody would have dreamed of defending, actions which are readily and completely explained by supposing Bacon to have been a man whose principles were not strict, and whose spirit was not high, actions which can be explained in no other way without resorting to some grotesque hypothesis for which there is not a tittle of evidence. But any hypothesis is, in Mr. Montagu's opinion, more probable than that his hero should ever have done anything very wrong. This mode of defending Bacon seems to us by no means Baconian. To take a man's character for granted, and then from his character to infer the moral quality of all his actions, is surely a process the very reverse of that which is recommended in the Novum Organum. Nothing, we are sure, could have led Mr. Montagu to depart so far from his master's precepts, except zeal for his master's honour. We shall follow a different course. We shall attempt, with the valuable assistance which Mr. Montagu has afforded us, to frame such an account of Bacon's life as may enable our readers correctly to estimate his character. It is hardly necessary to say that Francis Bacon was the son of Sir Nicholas Bacon, who held the great seal of England during the first twenty years of the reign of Elizabeth. The fame of the father has been thrown into shade by that of the son. But Sir Nicholas was no ordinary man. He belonged to a set of men whom it is easier to describe collectively than separately, whose minds were formed by one system of discipline, who belonged to one rank in society, to one university, to one party, to one sect, to one administration, and who resembled each other so much in talents, in opinions, in habits, in fortunes, that one character, we had almost said one life, may, to a considerable extent, serve for them all. They were the first generation of statesmen by profession that England produced. Before their time the division of labour had, in this respect, been very imperfect. Those who had directed public affairs had been, with few exceptions, warriors or priests; warriors whose rude courage was neither guided by science nor softened by humanity, priests whose learning and abilities were habitually devoted to the defence of tyranny and imposture. The Hotspurs, the Nevilles, the Cliffords, rough, illiterate, and unreflecting, brought to the council-board the fierce and imperious disposition which they had acquired amidst the tumult of predatory war, or in the gloomy repose of the garrisoned and moated castle. On the other side was the calm and subtle prelate, versed in all that was then considered as learning, trained in the Schools to manage words, and in the confessional to manage hearts, seldom superstitious, but skilful in practising on the superstition of others; false, as it was natural that a man should be whose profession imposed on all who were not saints the necessity of being hypocrites; selfish, as it was natural that a man should be who could form no domestic ties and cherish no hope of legitimate posterity, more attached to his order than to his country, and guiding the politics of England with a constant side-glance at Rome. But the increase of wealth, the progress of knowledge, and the reformation of religion produced a great change. The nobles ceased to be military chieftains; the priests ceased to possess a monopoly of learning; and a new and remarkable species of politicians appeared. These men came from neither of the classes which had, till then, almost exclusively furnished ministers of state. They were all laymen; yet they were all men of learning; and they were all men of peace. They were not members of the aristocracy. They inherited no titles, no large domains, no armies of retainers, no fortified castles. Yet they were not low men, such as those whom princes, jealous of the power of a nobility, have sometimes raised from forges and cobblers' stalls to the highest situations. They were all gentlemen by birth. They had all received a liberal education. It is a remarkable fact that they were all members of the same university. The two great national seats of learning had even then acquired the characters which they still retain. In intellectual activity, and in readiness to admit improvements, the superiority was then, as it has ever since been, on the side of the less ancient and splendid institution. Cambridge had the honour of educating those celebrated Protestant Bishops whom Oxford had the honour of burning; and at Cambridge were formed the minds of all those statesmen to whom chiefly is to be attributed the secure establishment of the reformed religion in the north of Europe. The statesmen of whom we speak passed their youth surrounded by the incessant din of theological controversy. Opinions were still in a state of chaotic anarchy, intermingling, separating, advancing, receding. Sometimes the stubborn bigotry of the Conservatives seemed likely to prevail. Then the impetuous onset of the Reformers for a moment carried all before it. Then again the resisting mass made a desperate stand, arrested the movement, and forced it slowly back. The vacillation which at that time appeared in English legislation, and which it has been the fashion to attribute to the caprice and to the power of one or two individuals, was truly a national vacillation. It was not only in the mind of Henry that the new theology obtained the ascendant one day, and that the lessons of the nurse and of the priest regained their influence on the morrow. It was not only in the House of Tudor that the husband was exasperated by the opposition of the wife, that the son dissented from the opinions of the father, that the brother persecuted the sister, that one sister persecuted another. The principles of Conservation and Reform carried on their warfare in every part of society, in every congregation, in every school of learning, round the hearth of every private family, in the recesses of every reflecting mind. It was in the midst of this ferment that the minds of the persons whom we are describing were developed. They were born Reformers. They belonged by nature to that order of men who always form the front ranks in the great intellectual progress. They were therefore, one and all, Protestants. In religious matters, however, though there is no reason to doubt that they were sincere, they were by no means zealous. None of them chose to run the smallest personal risk during the reign of Mary. None of them favoured the unhappy attempt of Northumberland in favour of his daughter-in-law. None of them shared in the desperate councils of Wyatt. They contrived to have business on the Continent; or, if they staid in England, they heard mass and kept Lent with great decorum. When those dark and perilous years had gone by, and when the Crown had descended to a new sovereign, they took the lead in the reformation of the Church. But they proceeded, not with the impetuosity of theologians, but with the calm determination of statesmen. They acted, not like men who considered the Romish worship as a system too offensive to God, and too destructive of souls, to be tolerated for an hour, but like men who regarded the points in dispute among Christians as in themselves unimportant, and who were not restrained by any scruple of conscience from professing, as they had before professed, the Catholic faith of Mary, the Protestant faith of Edward, or any of the numerous intermediate combinations which the caprice of Henry and the servile policy of Cranmer had formed out of the doctrines of both the hostile parties. They took a deliberate view of the state of their own country and of the Continent: they satisfied themselves as to the leaning of the public mind; and they chose their side. They placed themselves at the head of the Protestants of Europe, and staked all their fame and fortunes on the success of their party. It is needless to relate how dexterously, how resolutely, how gloriously they directed the politics of England during the eventful years which followed, how they succeeded in uniting their friends and separating their enemies, how they humbled the pride of Philip, how they backed the unconquerable spirit of Coligny, how they rescued Holland from tyranny, how they founded the maritime greatness of their country, how they outwitted the artful politicians of Italy, and tamed the ferocious chieftains of Scotland. It is impossible to deny that they committed many acts which would justly bring on a statesman of our time censures of the most serious kind. But, when we consider the state of morality in their age, and the unscrupulous character of the adversaries against whom they had to contend, we are forced to admit that it is not without reason that their names are still held in veneration by their countrymen. There were, doubtless, many diversities in their intellectual and moral character. But there was a strong family likeness. The constitution of their minds was remarkably sound. No particular faculty was pre-eminently developed; but manly health and vigour were equally diffused through the whole. They were men of letters. Their minds were by nature and by exercise well fashioned for speculative pursuits. It was by circumstances, rather than by any strong bias of inclination, that they were led to take a prominent part in active life. In active life, however, no men could be more perfectly free from the faults of mere theorists and pedants. No men observed more accurately the signs of the times. No men had a greater practical acquaintance with human nature. Their policy was generally characterised rather by vigilance, by moderation, and by firmness, than by invention, or by the spirit of enterprise. They spoke and wrote in a manner worthy of their excellent sense. Their eloquence was less copious and less ingenious, but far purer and more manly than that of the succeeding generation. It was the eloquence of men who had lived with the first translators of the Bible, and with the authors of the Book of Common Prayer. It was luminous, dignified, solid, and very slightly tainted with that affectation which deformed the style of the ablest men of the next age. If, as sometimes chanced, these politicians were under the necessity of taking a part in the theological controversies on which the dearest interests of kingdoms were then staked, they acquitted themselves as if their whole lives had been passed in the Schools and the Convocation. There was something in the temper of these celebrated men which secured them against the proverbial inconstancy both of the Court and of the multitude. No intrigue, no combination of rivals, could deprive them of the confidence of their Sovereign. No parliament attacked their influence. No mob coupled their names with any odious grievance. Their power ended only with their lives. In this respect, their fate presents a most remarkable contrast to that of the enterprising and brilliant politicians of the preceding and of the succeeding generation. Burleigh was Minister during forty years. Sir Nicholas Bacon held the great seal more than twenty years. Sir Walter Mildmay was Chancellor of the Exchequer twenty-three years. Sir Thomas Smith was Secretary of State eighteen years; Sir Francis Walsingham about as long. They all died in office, and in the enjoyment of public respect and royal favour. Far different had been the fate of Wolsey, Cromwell, Norfolk, Somerset, and Northumberland. Far different also was the fate of Essex, of Raleigh, and of the still more illustrious man whose life we propose to consider. The explanation of this circumstance is perhaps contained in the motto which Sir Nicholas Bacon inscribed over the entrance of his hall at Gorhambury, Mediocria firma. This maxim was constantly borne in mind by himself and his colleagues. They were more solicitous to lay the foundations of their power deep than to raise the structure to a conspicuous but insecure height. None of them aspired to be sole Minister. None of them provoked envy by an ostentatious display of wealth and influence. None of them affected to outshine the ancient aristocracy of the kingdom. They were free from that childish love of titles which characterised the successful courtiers of the generation which preceded them and of that which followed them. Only one of those whom we have named was made a peer; and he was content with the lowest degree of the peerage. As to money, none of them could, in that age, justly be considered as rapacious. Some of them would, even in our time, deserve the praise of eminent disinterestedness. Their fidelity to the State was incorruptible. Their private morals were without stain. Their households were sober and well governed. Among these statesmen Sir Nicholas Bacon was generally considered as ranking next to Burleigh. He was called by Camden "Sacris conciliis alterum columen"; and by George Buchanan,         "diu Britannici Regni secundum columen." The second wife of Sir Nicholas and mother of Francis Bacon was Anne, one of the daughters of Sir Anthony Cooke, a man of distinguished learning who had been tutor to Edward the Sixth. Sir Anthony had paid considerable attention to the education of his daughters, and lived to see them all splendidly and happily married. Their classical acquirements made them conspicuous even among the women of fashion of that age. Katherine, who became Lady Killigrew, wrote Latin Hexameters and Pentameters which would appear with credit in the Musae Etonenses. Mildred, the wife of Lord Burleigh, was described by Roger Ascham as the best Greek scholar among the young women of England, Lady Jane Grey always excepted. Anne, the mother of Francis Bacon, was distinguished both as a linguist and as a theologian. She corresponded in Greek with Bishop Jewel, and translated his Apologia from the Latin, so correctly that neither he nor Archbishop Parker could suggest a single alteration. She also translated a series of sermons on fate and free-will from the Tuscan of Bernardo Ochino. This fact is the more curious, because Ochino was one of that small and audacious band of Italian reformers, anathematised alike by Wittenberg, by Geneva, by Zurich, and by Rome, from which the Socinian sect deduces its origin. Lady Bacon was doubtless a lady of highly cultivated mind after the fashion of her age. But we must not suffer ourselves to be deluded into the belief that she and her sisters were more accomplished women than many who are now living. On this subject there is, we think, much misapprehension. We have often heard men who wish, as almost all men of sense wish, that women should be highly educated, speak with rapture of the English ladies of the sixteenth century, and lament that they can find no modern damsel resembling those fair pupils of Ascham and Aylmer who compared, over their embroidery, the styles of Isocrates and Lysias, and who, while the horns were sounding, and the dogs in full cry, sat in the lonely oriel, with eyes riveted to that immortal page which tells how meekly and bravely the first great martyr of intellectual liberty took the cup from his weeping gaoler. But surely these complaints have very little foundation. We would by no means disparage the ladies of the sixteenth century or their pursuits. But we conceive that those who extol them at the expense of the women of our time forget one very obvious and very important circumstance. In the time of Henry the Eighth and Edward the Sixth, a person who did not read Greek and Latin could read nothing, or next to nothing. The Italian was the only modern language which possessed anything that could be called a literature. All the valuable books then extant in all the vernacular dialects of Europe would hardly have filled a single shelf, England did not yet possess Shakspeare's plays and the Fairy Queen, nor France Montaigne's Essays, nor Spain Don Quixote. In looking round a well-furnished library, how many English or French books can we find which were extant when Lady Jane Grey and Queen Elizabeth received their education? Chaucer, Gower, Froissart, Commines, Rabelais, nearly complete the list. It was therefore absolutely necessary that a woman should be uneducated or classically educated. Indeed, without a knowledge of one of the ancient languages no person could then have any clear notion of what was passing in the political, the literary, or the religious world. The Latin was in the sixteenth century all and more than all that the French was in the eighteenth. It was the language of courts as well as of the schools. It was the language of diplomacy; it was the language of theological and political controversy. Being a fixed language, while the living languages were in a state of fluctuation, and being universally known to the learned and the polite, it was employed by almost every writer who aspired to a wide and durable reputation. A person who was ignorant of it was shut out from all acquaintance, not merely with Cicero and Virgil, not merely with heavy treatises on canon-law and school divinity, but with the most interesting memoirs, state papers, and pamphlets of his own time, nay even with the most admired poetry and the most popular squibs which appeared on the fleeting topics of the day, with Buchanan's complimentary verses, with Erasmus's dialogues, with Hutten's epistles. This is no longer the case. All political and religious controversy is now conducted in the modern languages. The ancient tongues are used only in comments on the ancient writers. The great productions of Athenian and Roman genius are indeed still what they were. But though their positive value is unchanged, their relative value, when compared with the whole mass of mental wealth possessed by mankind, has been constantly falling. They were the intellectual all of our ancestors. They are but a part of our treasures. Over what tragedy could Lady Jane Grey have wept, over what comedy could she have smiled, if the ancient dramatists had not been in her library? A modern reader can make shift without Oedipus and Medea, while he possesses Othello and Hamlet. If he knows nothing of Pyrgopolynices and Thraso, he is familiar with Bobadil, and Bessus, and Pistol, and Parolles. If he cannot enjoy the delicious irony of Plato, he may find some compensation in that of Pascal. If he is shut out from Nephelococcygia, he may take refuge in Lilliput. We are guilty, we hope, of no irreverence towards those great nations to which the human race owes art, science, taste, civil and intellectual freedom, when we say, that the stock bequeathed by them to us has been so carefully improved that the accumulated interest now exceeds the principal. We believe that the books which have been written in the languages of western Europe, during the last two hundred and fifty years,--translations from the ancient languages of course included,--are of greater value than all the books which at the beginning of that period were extant in the world. With the modern languages of Europe English women are at least as well acquainted as English men. When, therefore, we compare the acquirements of Lady Jane Grey. with those of an accomplished young woman of our own time, we have no hesitation in awarding the superiority  to the latter. We hope that our readers will pardon up this digression. It is long; but it can hardly be called unseasonable, if it tends to convince them that they are mistaken in thinking that the great-great-grandmothers of their great-great-grandmothers were superior women to their sisters and their wives. Francis Bacon, the youngest son of Sir Nicholas, was born at York House, his father's residence in the Strand, on the twenty-second of January 1561. The health of Francis was very delicate; and to this circumstance may be partly attributed that gravity of carriage, and that love of sedentary pursuits which distinguished him from other boys. Everybody knows how much sobriety of deportment and his premature readiness of wit amused the Queen, and how she used to call him her young Lord Keeper. We are told that, while still a mere child, he stole away from his playfellows to a vault in St. James's Fields, for the purpose of investigating the cause of a singular echo which he had observed there. It is certain that, at only twelve, he busied himself with very ingenious speculations on the art of legerdemain; a subject which, as Professor Dugald Stewart has most justly observed, merits much more attention from philosophers than it has ever received. These are trifles. But the eminence which Bacon afterwards attained makes them interesting. In the thirteenth year of his age he was entered at Trinity College, Cambridge. That celebrated school of learning enjoyed the peculiar favour of the Lord Treasurer and the Lord Keeper, and acknowledged the advantages which it derived from their patronage in a public letter which bears date just a month after the admission of Francis Bacon. The master was Whitgift, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury, a narrow minded, mean, and tyrannical priest, who gained power by servility and adulation, and employed it in persecuting both those who agreed with Calvin about church-government, and those who differed from Calvin touching the doctrine of Reprobation. He was now in a chrysalis state, putting off the worm, and putting on the dragon-fly, a kind of intermediate grub between sycophant and oppressor. He was indemnifying himself for the court which he found it expedient to pay to the Ministers by exercising much petty tyranny within his own college. It would be unjust, however, to deny him the praise of having rendered about this time one important service to letters. He stood up manfully against those who wished to make Trinity College a mere appendage to Westminster school; and by this act, the only good act, as far as we remember, of his long public life, he saved the noblest place of education in England from the degrading fate of King's College and New College. It has often been said that Bacon, while still at college, planned that great intellectual revolution with which his name is inseparably connected. The evidence on this subject, however, is hardly sufficient to prove what is in itself so improbable as that any definite scheme of that kind should have been so early formed, even by so powerful and active a mind. But it is certain that, after a residence of three years at Cambridge, Bacon departed, carrying with him a profound contempt for the course of study pursued there, a fixed conviction that the system of academic education in England was radically vicious, a just scorn for the trifles on which the followers of Aristotle had wasted their powers, and no great reverence for Aristotle himself. In his sixteenth year he visited Paris, and resided there for some time, under the care of Sir Amias Paulet, Elizabeth's Minister at the French Court, and one of the ablest and most upright of the many valuable servants whom she employed. France was at that time in a deplorable state of agitation. The Huguenots and the Catholics were mustering all their force for the fiercest and most protracted of their many struggles; while the prince, whose duty it was to protect and to restrain both, had by his vices and follies degraded himself so deeply that he had no authority over either. Bacon, however, made a tour through several provinces, and appears to have passed some time at Poitiers. We have abundant proof that during his stay on the Continent he did not neglect literary and scientific pursuits. But his attention seems to have been chiefly directed to statistics and diplomacy. It was at this time that he wrote those Notes on the State of Europe which are printed in his works. He studied the principles of the art of deciphering with great interest, and invented one cipher so ingenious, that, many years later, he thought it deserving of a place in the De Augmentis. In February 1580, while engaged in these pursuits, he received intelligence of the almost sudden death of his father, and instantly returned to England. His prospects were greatly overcast by this event. He was most desirous to obtain a provision which might enable him to devote himself to literature and politics. He applied to the Government; and it seems strange that he should have applied in vain. His wishes were moderate. His hereditary claims on the administration were great. He had himself been favourably noticed by the Queen. His uncle was Prime Minister. His own talents were such as any Minister might have been eager to enlist in the public service. But his solicitations were unsuccessful. The truth is that the Cecils disliked him, and did all that they could decently do to keep him down. It has never been alleged that Bacon had done anything to merit this dislike; nor is it at all probable that a man whose temper was naturally mild, whose manners were courteous, who, through life, nursed his fortunes with the utmost care, and who was fearful even to a fault of offending the powerful, would have given any just cause of displeasure to a kinsman who had the means of rendering him essential service and of doing him irreparable injury. The real explanation, we believe, is this. Robert Cecil, the Treasurer's second son, was younger by a few months than Bacon. He had been educated with the utmost care, had been initiated, while still a boy, in the mysteries of diplomacy and court-intrigue, and was just at this time about to be produced on the stage of public life. The wish nearest to Burleigh's heart was that his own greatness might descend to this favourite child. But even Burleigh's fatherly partiality could hardly prevent him from perceiving that Robert, with all his abilities and acquirements, was no match for his cousin Francis. This seems to us the only rational explanation of the Treasurer's conduct. Mr. Montagu is more charitable. He supposes that Burleigh was influenced merely by affection for his nephew, and was "little disposed to encourage him to rely on others rather than on himself, and to venture on the quicksands of politics, instead of the certain profession of the law." If such were Burleigh's feelings, it seems strange that he should have suffered his son to venture on those quicksands from which he so carefully preserved his nephew. But the truth is that, if Burleigh had been so disposed, he might easily have secured to Bacon a comfortable provision which should have been exposed to no risk. And it is certain that he showed as little disposition to enable his nephew to live by a profession as to enable him to live without a profession. That Bacon himself attributed the conduct of his relatives to jealousy of his superior talents, we have not the smallest doubt. In a letter written many years later to Villiers, he expresses himself thus: "Countenance, encourage, and advance able men in all kinds, degrees, and professions. For in the time of the Cecils, the father and the son, able men were by design and of purpose suppressed." Whatever Burleigh's motives might be, his purpose was unalterable. The supplications which Francis addressed to his uncle and aunt were earnest, humble, and almost servile. He was the most promising and accomplished young man of his time. His father had been the brother-in-law, the most useful colleague, the nearest friend of the Minister. But all this availed poor Francis nothing. He was forced, much against his will, to betake himself to the study of the law. He was admitted at Gray's Inn; and during some years, he laboured there in obscurity. What the extent of his legal attainments may have been it is difficult to say. It was not hard for a man of his powers to acquire that very moderate portion of technical knowledge which, when joined to quickness, tact, wit, ingenuity, eloquence, and knowledge of the world, is sufficient to raise an advocate to the highest professional eminence. The general opinion appears to have been that which was on one occasion expressed by Elizabeth. "Bacon," said she, "hath a great wit and much learning; but in law showeth to the utmost of his knowledge, and is not deep." The Cecils, we suspect, did their best to spread this opinion by whispers and insinuations. Coke openly proclaimed it with that rancorous insolence which was habitual to him. No reports are more readily believed than those which disparage genius, and soothe the envy of conscious mediocrity. It must have been inexpressibly consoling to a stupid sergeant, the forerunner of him who, a hundred and fifty years later, "shook his head at Murray as a wit," to know that the most profound thinker and the most accomplished orator of the age was very imperfectly acquainted with the law touching bastard eigne and mulier puisne, and confounded the right of free fishery with that of common piscary. It is certain that no man in that age, or indeed during the century and a half which followed, was better acquainted than Bacon with the philosophy of law. His technical knowledge was quite sufficient, with the help of his admirable talents and of his insinuating address, to procure clients. He rose very rapidly into business, and soon entertained hopes of being called within the bar. He applied to Lord Burleigh for that purpose, but received a testy refusal. Of the grounds of that refusal we can, in some measure, judge by Bacon's answer, which is still extant. It seems that the old Lord, whose temper, age and gout had by no means altered for the better, and who loved to mark his dislike of the showy, quick-witted young men of the rising generation, took this opportunity to read Francis a very sharp lecture on his vanity and want of respect for his betters. Francis returned a most submissive reply, thanked the Treasurer for the admonition, and promised to profit by it. Strangers meanwhile were less unjust to the young barrister than his nearest kinsman had been. In his twenty-sixth year he became a bencher of his Inn; and two years later he was appointed Lent reader. At length, in 1590, he obtained for the first time some show of favour from the Court. He was sworn in Queen's Counsel extraordinary.    But this mark of honour was not accompanied by any pecuniary emolument. He continued, therefore, to solicit his powerful relatives for some provision which might enable him to live without drudging at his profession. He bore, with a patience and serenity which, we fear, bordered on meanness, the morose humours of his uncle, and the sneering reflections which his cousin cast on speculative men, lost in philosophical dreams, and too wise to be capable of transacting public business. At length the Cecils were generous enough to procure for him the reversion of the Registrarship of the Star-Chamber. This was a lucrative place; but, as many years elapsed before it fell in, he was still under the necessity of labouring for his daily bread. In the Parliament which was called in 1593 he sat as member for the county of Middlesex, and soon attained eminence as a debater. It is easy to perceive from the scanty remains of his oratory that the same compactness of expression and richness of fancy which appear in his writings characterised his speeches; and that his extensive acquaintance with literature and history enabled him to entertain his audience with a vast variety of illustrations and allusions which were generally happy and apposite, but which were probably not least pleasing to the taste of that age when they were such as would now be thought childish or pedantic. It is evident also that he was, as indeed might have been expected, perfectly free from those faults which are generally found in an advocate who, after having risen to eminence at the bar, enters the House of Commons; that it was his habit to deal with every great question, not in small detached portions, but as a whole; that he refined little, and that his reasonings were those of a capacious rather than a subtle mind. Ben Jonson, a most unexceptionable judge, has described Bacon's eloquence in words, which, though often quoted, will bear to be quoted again. "There happened in my time one noble speaker who was full of gravity in his speaking. His language, where he could spare or pass by a jest, was nobly censorious. No man ever spoke more neatly, more pressly, more weightily, or suffered less emptiness, less idleness, in what he uttered. No member of his speech but consisted of his own graces. His hearers could not cough or look aside from him without loss. He commanded where he spoke, and had his judges angry and pleased at his devotion. No man had their affections more in his power. The fear of every man that heard him was lest he should make an end." From the mention which is made of judges, it would seem that Jonson had heard Bacon only at the Bar. Indeed we imagine that the House of Commons was then almost inaccessible to strangers. It is not probable that a man of Bacon's nice observation would speak in Parliament exactly as he spoke in the Court of Queen's Bench. But the graces of manner and language must, to a great extent, have been common between the Queen's Counsel and the Knight of the Shire. Bacon tried to play a very difficult game in politics. He wished to be at once a favourite at Court and popular with the multitude. If any man could have succeeded in this attempt, a man of talents so rare, of judgment so prematurely ripe, of temper so calm, and of manners so plausible, might have been expected to succeed. Nor indeed did he wholly fail. Once, however, he indulged in a burst of patriotism which cost him a long and bitter remorse, and which he never ventured to repeat. The Court asked for large subsidies and for speedy payment. The remains of Bacon's speech breathe all the spirit of the Long Parliament. "The gentlemen," said he, "must sell their plate, and the farmers their brass pots, ere this will be paid; and for us, we are here to search the wounds of the realm, and not to skim them over. The dangers are these. First, we shall breed discontent and endanger her Majesty's safety, which must consist more in the love of the people than their wealth. Secondly, this being granted in this sort, other princes hereafter will look for the like; so that we shall put an evil precedent on ourselves and our posterity; and in histories, it is to be observed, of all nations the English are not to be subject, base, or taxable." The Queen and her Ministers resented this outbreak of public spirit in the highest manner. Indeed, many an honest member of the House of Commons had, for a much smaller matter, been sent to the Tower by the proud and hot-blooded Tudors. The young patriot condescended to make the most abject apologies. He adjured the Lord Treasurer to show some favour to his poor servant and ally. He bemoaned himself to the Lord Keeper, in a letter which may keep in countenance the most unmanly of the epistles which Cicero wrote during his banishment. The lesson was not thrown away. Bacon never offended in the same manner again. He was now satisfied that he had little to hope from the patronage of those powerful kinsmen whom he had solicited during twelve years with such meek pertinacity; and he began to look towards a different quarter. Among the courtiers of Elizabeth had lately appeared a new favourite, young, noble, wealthy, accomplished, eloquent brave, generous, aspiring; a favourite who had obtained from the grey-headed Queen such marks of regard as she had scarce vouchsafed to Leicester in the season of the passions; who was at once the ornament of the palace and the idol of the city. who was the common patron of men of letters and of men of the sword; who was the common refuge of the persecuted Catholic and of the persecuted Puritan. The calm prudence which had enabled Burleigh to shape his course through so many dangers, and the vast experience which he had acquired in dealing with two generations of colleagues and rivals, seemed scarcely sufficient to support him in this new competition; and Robert Cecil sickened with fear and envy as he contemplated the rising fame and influence of Essex. The history of the factions which, towards the close of the reign of Elizabeth, divided her court and her council, though pregnant with instruction, is by no means interesting or pleasing. Both parties employed the means which are familiar to unscrupulous statesmen; and neither had, or even pretended to have, any important end in view. The public mind was then reposing from one great effort, and collecting strength for another. That impetuous and appalling rush with which the human intellect had moved forward in the career of truth and liberty, during the fifty years which followed the separation of Luther from the communion of the Church of Rome, was now over. The boundary between Protestantism and Popery had been fixed very nearly where it still remains. England, Scotland, the Northern kingdoms were on one side; Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Italy, on the other. The line of demarcation ran, as it still runs, through the midst of the Netherlands, of Germany, and of Switzerland, dividing province from province, electorate from electorate, and canton from canton. France might be considered as a debatable land, in which the contest was still undecided. Since that time, the two religions have done little more than maintain their ground. A few occasional incursions have been made. But the general frontier remains the same. During two hundred and fifty years no great society has risen up like one man, and emancipated itself by one mighty effort from the superstition of ages. This spectacle was common in the sixteenth century. Why has it ceased to be so? Why has so violent a movement been followed by so long a repose? The doctrines of the Reformers are not less agreeable to reason or to revelation now than formerly. The public mind is assuredly not less enlightened now than formerly. Why is it that Protestantism, after carrying everything before it in a time of comparatively little knowledge and little freedom, should make no perceptible progress in a reasoning and tolerant age; that the Luthers, the Calvins, the Knoxes, the Zwingles, should have left no successors; that during two centuries and a half fewer converts should have been brought over from the Church of Rome than at the time of the Reformation were sometimes gained in a year? This has always appeared to us one of the most curious and interesting problems in history. On some future occasion we may perhaps attempt to solve it. At present it is enough to say that, at the close of Elizabeth's reign, the Protestant party, to borrow the language of the Apocalypse, had left its first love and had ceased to do its first works. The great struggle of the sixteenth century was over. The great struggle of the seventeenth century had not commenced. The confessors of Mary's reign were dead. The members of the Long Parliament were still in their cradles. The Papists had been deprived of all power in the State. The Puritans had not yet attained any formidable extent of power. True it is that a student, well acquainted with the history of the next generation, can easily discern in the proceedings of the last Parliaments of Elizabeth the germ of great and ever memorable events. But to the eye of a contemporary nothing of this appeared. The two sections of ambitious men who were struggling for power differed from each other on no important public question. Both belonged to the Established Church. Both professed boundless loyalty to the Queen. Both approved the war with Spain. There is not, as far as we are aware, any reason to believe that they entertained different views concerning the succession to the Crown. Certainly neither faction had any great measure of reform in view. Neither attempted to redress any public grievance. The most odious and pernicious grievance under which the nation then suffered was a source of profit to both, and was defended by both with equal zeal. Raleigh held a monopoly of cards, Essex a monopoly of sweet wines. In fact, the only ground of quarrel between the parties was that they could not agree as to their respective shares of power and patronage. Nothing in the political conduct of Essex entitles him to esteem; and the pity with which we regard his early and terrible end is diminished by the consideration, that he put to hazard the lives and fortunes of his most attached friends, and endeavoured to throw the whole country into confusion, for objects purely personal. Still, it is impossible not to be deeply interested for a man so brave, high-spirited, and generous; for a man who, while he conducted himself towards his sovereign with a boldness such as was then found in no other subject, conducted himself towards his dependants with a delicacy such as has rarely been found in any other patron. Unlike the vulgar herd of benefactors, he desired to inspire, not gratitude, but affection. He tried to make those whom he befriended feel towards him as towards an equal. His mind, ardent, susceptible, naturally disposed to admiration of all that is great and beautiful, was fascinated by the genius and the accomplishments of Bacon. A close friendship was soon formed between them, a friendship destined to have a dark, a mournful, a shameful end. In 1594 the office of Attorney-General became vacant, and Bacon hoped to obtain it. Essex made his friend's cause his own, sued, expostulated, promised, threatened, but all in vain. It is probable that the dislike felt by the Cecils for Bacon had been increased by the connection which he had lately formed with the Earl. Robert was then on the point of being made Secretary of State. He happened one day to be in the same coach with Essex, and a remarkable conversation took place between them. "My Lord," said Sir Robert, "the Queen has determined to appoint an Attorney-General without more delay. I pray your Lordship to let me know whom you will favour." "I wonder at your question," replied the Earl. "You cannot but know that resolutely, against all the world, I stand for your cousin, Francis Bacon." "Good Lord!" cried Cecil, unable to bridle his temper, "I wonder your Lordship should spend your strength on so unlikely a matter. Can you name one precedent of so raw a youth promoted to so great a place?" This objection came with a singularly bad grace from a man who, though younger than Bacon, was in daily expectation of being made Secretary of State. The blot was too obvious to be missed by Essex, who seldom forbore to speak his mind. "I have made no search," said he, "for precedents of young men who have filled the office of Attorney-General. But I could name to you, Sir Robert, a man younger than Francis, less learned, and equally inexperienced, who is suing and striving with all his might for an office of far greater weight." Sir Robert had nothing to say but that he thought his own abilities equal to the place which he hoped to obtain, and that his father's long services deserved such a mark of gratitude from the Queen; as if his abilities were comparable to his cousin's, or as if Sir Nicholas Bacon had done no service to the State. Cecil then hinted that, if Bacon would be satisfied with the Solicitorship, that might be of easier digestion to the Queen. "Digest me no digestions," said the generous and ardent Earl. "The Attorneyship for Francis is that I must have; and in that I will spend all my power, might, authority, and amity; and with tooth and nail procure the same for him against whomsoever; and whosoever getteth this office out of my hands for any other, before he have it, it shall cost him the coming by. And this be you assured of, Sir Robert, for now I fully declare myself; and for my own part, Sir Robert, I think strange both of my Lord Treasurer and you, that can have the mind to seek the preference of a stranger before so near a kinsman; for if you weigh in a balance the parts every way of his competitor and him, only excepting five poor years of admitting to a house of court before Francis, you shall find in all other respects whatsoever no comparison between them." When the office of Attorney-General was filled up, the Earl pressed the Queen to make Bacon Solicitor-General, and, on this occasion, the old Lord Treasurer professed himself not unfavourable to his nephew's pretensions. But after a contest which lasted more than a year and a half, and in which Essex, to use his own words, "spent all his power, might, authority, and amity," the place was given to another. Essex felt this disappointment keenly, but found consolation in the most munificent and delicate liberality. He presented Bacon with an estate worth near two thousand pounds, situated at Twickenham; and this, as Bacon owned many years after, "with so kind and noble circumstances as the manner was worth more than the matter." It was soon after these events that Bacon first appeared before the public as a writer. Early in 1597 he published a small volume of Essays, which was afterwards enlarged by successive additions to many times its original bulk. This little work was, as it well deserved to be, exceedingly popular. It was reprinted in a few months; it was translated into Latin, French, and Italian; and it seems to have at once established the literary reputation of its author. But, though Bacon's reputation rose, his fortunes were still depressed. He was in great pecuniary difficulties; and, on one occasion, was arrested in the street at the suit of a goldsmith for a debt of three hundred pounds, and was carried to a spunging-house in Coleman Street. The kindness of Essex was in the meantime indefatigable. In 1596 he sailed on his memorable expedition to the coast of Spain. At the very moment of his embarkation, he wrote to several of his friends, commending, to them, during his own absence, the interests of Bacon. He returned, after performing the most brilliant military exploit that was achieved on the Continent by English arms during the long interval which elapsed between the battle of Agincourt and that of Blenheim. His valour, his talents, his humane and generous disposition, had made him the idol of his countrymen, and had extorted praise from the enemies whom he had conquered. [See Cervantes's Novela de la Espanola Inglesa.] He had always been proud and headstrong; and his splendid success seems to have rendered his faults more offensive than ever. But to his friend Francis he was still the same. Bacon had some thoughts of making his fortune by marriage, and had begun to pay court to a widow of the name of Hatton. The eccentric manners and violent temper of this woman made her a disgrace and a torment to her connections. But Bacon was not aware of her faults, or was disposed to overlook them for the sake of her ample fortune. Essex pleaded his friend's cause with his usual ardour. The letters which the Earl addressed to Lady Hatton and to her mother are still extant, and are highly honourable to him. "If," he wrote, "she were my sister or my daughter, I protest I would as confidently resolve to further it as I now persuade you"; and again, "If my faith be anything, I protest, if I had one as near me as  she is to you, I had rather match her with him, than with men of far greater titles." The suit, happily for Bacon, was unsuccessful. The lady indeed was kind to him in more ways than one. She rejected him; and she accepted his enemy. She married that narrow-minded, bad-hearted pedant, Sir Edward Coke, and did her best to make him as miserable as he deserved to be. The fortunes of Essex had now reached their height, and began to decline. He possessed indeed all the qualities which raise men to greatness rapidly. But he had neither the virtues nor the vices which enable men to retain greatness long. His frankness, his keen sensibility to insult and injustice, were by no means agreeable to a sovereign naturally impatient of opposition, and accustomed, during forty years, to the most extravagant flattery and the most abject submission. The daring and contemptuous manner in which he bade defiance to his enemies excited their deadly hatred. His administration in Ireland was unfortunate, and in many respects highly blamable. Though his brilliant courage and his impetuous activity fitted him admirably for such enterprises as that of Cadiz, he did not possess the caution, patience, and resolution necessary for the conduct of a protracted war, in which difficulties were to be gradually surmounted, in which much discomfort was to be endured, and in which few splendid exploits could be achieved. For the civil duties of his high place he was still less qualified. Though eloquent and accomplished, he was in no sense a statesman. The multitude indeed still continued to regard even his faults with fondness. But the Court had ceased to give him credit, even for the merit which he really possessed. The person on whom, during the decline of his influence, he chiefly depended, to whom he confided his perplexities, whose advice he solicited, whose intercession he employed, was his friend Bacon. The lamentable truth must be told. This friend, so loved, so trusted, bore a principal part in ruining the Earl's fortunes, in shedding his blood, and in blackening his memory. But let us be just to Bacon. We believe that, to the last, he had no wish to injure Essex. Nay, we believe that he sincerely exerted himself to serve Essex, as long as he thought that he could serve Essex without injuring himself. The advice which he gave to his noble benefactor was generally most judicious. He did all in his power to dissuade the Earl from accepting the Government of Ireland. "For," says he, "I did as plainly see, his overthrow chained as it were by destiny to that journey, as it is possible for a man to ground a judgment upon future contingents." The prediction was accomplished. Essex returned in disgrace. Bacon attempted to mediate between his friend and the Queen; and, we believe, honestly employed all his address for that purpose. But the task which he had undertaken was too difficult, delicate, and perilous, even for so wary and dexterous an agent. He had to manage two spirits equally proud, resentful) and ungovernable. At Essex House, he had to calm the rage of a young hero incensed by multiplied wrongs and humiliations) and then to pass to Whitehall for the purpose of soothing the peevishness of a sovereign, whose temper, never very gentle, had been rendered morbidly irritable by age, by declining health, and by the long habit of listening to flattery and exacting implicit obedience. It is hard to serve two masters. Situated as Bacon was, it was scarcely possible for him to shape his course so as not to give one or both of his employers reason to complain. For a time he acted as fairly as, in circumstances so embarrassing, could reasonably be expected. At length he found that, while he was trying to prop the fortunes of another, he was in danger of shaking his own. He had disobliged both the parties whom he wished to reconcile. Essex thought him wanting in zeal as a friend: Elizabeth thought him wanting in duty as a subject. The Earl looked on him as a spy of the Queen; the Queen as a creature of the Earl. The reconciliation which he had laboured to effect appeared utterly hopeless. A thousand signs, legible to eyes far less keen than his, announced that the fall of his patron was at hand. He shaped his course accordingly. When Essex was brought before the council to answer for his conduct in Ireland, Bacon, after a faint attempt to excuse himself from taking part against his friend, submitted himself to the Queen's pleasure, and appeared at the bar in support of the charges. But a darker scene was behind. The unhappy young nobleman, made reckless by despair ventured on a rash and criminal enterprise, which rendered him liable to the highest penalties of the law. What course was Bacon to take? This was one of those conjunctures which show what men are. To a high- minded man, wealth, power, court-favour, even personal safety, would have appeared of no account, when opposed to friendship, gratitude, and honour. Such a man would have stood by the side of Essex at the trial, would have "spent all his power, might, authority, and amity" in soliciting a mitigation of the sentence, would have been a daily visitor at the cell, would have received the last injunctions and the last embrace on the scaffold, would have employed all the powers of his intellect to guard from insult the fame of his generous though erring friend. An ordinary man would neither have incurred the danger of succouring Essex, nor the disgrace of assailing him. Bacon did not even preserve neutrality. He appeared as counsel for the prosecution. In that situation, he did not confine himself to what would have been amply sufficient to procure a verdict. He employed all his wit, his rhetoric, and his learning, not to ensure a conviction,--for the circumstances were such that a conviction was inevitable,-- but to deprive the unhappy prisoner of all those excuses which, though legally of no value, yet tended to diminish the moral guilt of the crime, and which, therefore, though they could not justify the peers in pronouncing an acquittal, might incline the Queen to grant a pardon. The Earl urged as a palliation of his frantic acts that he was surrounded by powerful and inveterate enemies, that they had ruined his fortunes, that they sought his life, and that their persecutions had driven him to despair. This was true; and Bacon well knew it to be true. But he affected to treat it as an idle pretence. He compared Essex to Pisistratus, who, by pretending to be in imminent danger of assassination, and by exhibiting self-inflicted wounds, succeeded in establishing tyranny at Athens. This was too much for the prisoner to bear. He interrupted his ungrateful friend by calling on him to quit the part of an advocate, to come forward as a witness, and to tell the Lords whether, in old times, he, Francis Bacon, had not, under his own hand, repeatedly asserted the truth of what he now represented as idle pretexts. It is painful to go on with this lamentable story. Bacon returned a shuffling answer to the Earl's question, and, as if the allusion to Pisistratus were not sufficiently offensive, made another allusion still more unjustifiable. He compared Essex to Henry Duke of Guise, and the rash attempt in the city to the day of the barricades at Paris. Why Bacon had recourse to such a topic it is difficult to say, It was quite unnecessary for the purpose of obtaining a verdict. It was certain to produce a strong impression on the mind of the haughty and jealous princess on whose pleasure the Earl's fate depended. The faintest allusion to the degrading tutelage in which the last Valois had been held by the House of Lorraine was sufficient to harden her heart against a man who in rank, in military reputation, in popularity among the citizens of the capital, bore some resemblance to the Captain of the League. Essex was convicted. Bacon made no effort to save him, though the Queen's feelings were such that he might have pleaded his benefactor's cause, possibly with success, certainly without any serious danger to himself. The unhappy nobleman was executed. His fate excited strong, perhaps unreasonable feelings of compassion and indignation. The Queen was received by the citizens of London with gloomy looks and faint acclamations. She thought it expedient to publish a vindication of her late proceedings. The faithless friend who had assisted in taking the Earl's life was now employed to murder the Earl's fame. The Queen had seen some of Bacon's writings, and had been pleased with them. He was accordingly selected to write A Declaration of the Practices and Treasons attempted and committed by Robert Earl of Essex, which was printed by authority. In the succeeding reign, Bacon had not a word to say in defence of this performance, a performance abounding in expressions which no generous enemy would have employed respecting a man who had so dearly expiated his offences. His only excuse was, that he wrote it by command, that he considered himself as a mere secretary, that he had particular instructions as to the way in which he was to treat every part of the subject, and that, in fact, he had furnished only the arrangement and the style. We regret to say that the whole conduct of Bacon through the course of these transactions appears to Mr. Montagu not merely excusable, but deserving of high admiration. The integrity and benevolence of this gentleman are so well known that our readers will probably be at a loss to conceive by what steps he can have arrived at so extraordinary a conclusion: and we are half afraid that they will suspect us of practising some artifice upon them when we report the principal arguments which he employs. In order to get rid of the charge of ingratitude, Mr. Montagu attempts to show that Bacon lay under greater obligations to the Queen than to Essex. What these obligations were it is not easy to discover. The situation of Queen's Counsel, and a remote reversion, were surely favours very far below Bacon's personal and hereditary claims. They were favours which had not cost the Queen a groat, nor had they put a groat into Bacon's purse. It was necessary to rest Elizabeth's claims to gratitude on some other ground; and this Mr. Montagu felt. "What perhaps was her greatest kindness," says he, "instead of having hastily advanced Bacon, she had, with a continuance of her friendship, made him bear the yoke in his youth. Such were his obligations to Elizabeth." Such indeed they were. Being the son of one of her oldest and most faithful Ministers, being himself the ablest and most accomplished young man of his time, he had been condemned by her to drudgery, to obscurity, to poverty. She had depreciated his acquirements. She had checked him in the most imperious manner, when in Parliament he ventured to act an independent part. She had refused to him the professional advancement to which he had a just claim. To her it was owing that, while younger men, not superior to him in extraction, and far inferior to him in every kind of personal merit, were filling the highest offices of the State, adding manor to manor, rearing palace after palace, he was lying at a spunging-house for a debt of three hundred pounds. Assuredly if Bacon owed gratitude to Elizabeth, he owed none to Essex. If the Queen really was his best friend, the Earl was his worst enemy. We wonder that Mr. Montagu did not press this argument a little further. He might have maintained that Bacon was excusable in revenging himself on a man who had attempted to rescue his youth from the salutary yoke imposed on it by the Queen, who had wished to advance him hastily, who, not content with attempting to inflict the Attorney-Generalship upon him, had been so cruel as to present him with a landed estate. Again, we can hardly think Mr. Montagu serious when he tells us that Bacon was bound for the sake of the public not to destroy his own hopes of advancement, and that he took part against Essex from a wish to obtain power which might enable him to be useful to his country. We really do not know how to refute such arguments except by stating them. Nothing is impossible which does not involve a contradiction. It is barely possible that Bacon's motives for acting as he did on this occasion may have been gratitude to the Queen for keeping him poor, and a desire to benefit his fellow-creatures in some high situation. And there is a possibility that Bonner may have been a good Protestant who, being convinced that the blood of martyrs is the seed of the Church, heroically went through all the drudgery and infamy of persecution, in order that he might inspire the English people with an intense and lasting hatred of Popery. There is a possibility that Jeffreys may have been an ardent lover of liberty, and that he may have beheaded Algernon Sydney, and burned Elizabeth Gaunt, only in order to produce a reaction which might lead to the limitation of the prerogative. There is a possibility that Thurtell may have killed Weare only in order to give the youth of England an impressive warning against gaming and bad company. There is a possibility that Fauntleroy may have forged powers of attorney, only in order that his fate might turn the attention of the public to the defects of the penal law. These things, we say, are possible. But they are so extravagantly improbable that a man who should act on such suppositions would be fit only for Saint Luke's. And we do not see why suppositions on which no rational man would act in ordinary life should be admitted into history. Mr. Montagu's notion that Bacon desired power only in order to do good to mankind appears somewhat strange to us, when we consider how Bacon afterwards used power, and how he lost it. Surely the service which he rendered to mankind by taking Lady Wharton's broad pieces and Sir John Kennedy's cabinet was not of such vast importance as to sanctify all the means which might conduce to that end. If the case were fairly stated, it would, we much fear, stand thus: Bacon was a servile advocate, that he might be a corrupt judge. Mr. Montagu maintains that none but the ignorant and unreflecting can think Bacon censurable for anything that he did as counsel for the Crown, and that no advocate can justifiably use any discretion as to the party for whom he appears. We will not at present inquire whether the doctrine which is held on this subject by English lawyers be or be not agreeable to reason and morality; whether it be right that a man should, with a wig on his head, and a band round his neck, do for a guinea what, without those appendages, he would think it wicked and infamous to do for an empire; whether it be right that, not merely believing but knowing a statement to be true, he should do all that can be done by sophistry, by rhetoric, by solemn asseveration, by indignant exclamation, by gesture, by play of features, by terrifying one honest witness, by perplexing another, to cause a jury to think that statement false. It is not necessary on the present occasion to decide these questions. The professional rules, be they good or bad, are rules to which many wise and virtuous men have conformed, and are daily conforming. If, therefore, Bacon did no more than these rules required of him, we shall readily admit that he was blameless, or, at least, excusable. But we conceive that his conduct was not justifiable according to any professional rules that now exist, or that ever existed in England. It has always been held that, in criminal cases in which the prisoner was denied the help of counsel, and above all, in capital cases, advocates were both entitled and bound to exercise a discretion. It is true that after the Revolution, when the Parliament began to make inquisition for the innocent blood which had been shed by the last Stuarts, a feeble attempt was made to defend the lawyers who had been accomplices in the murder of Sir Thomas Armstrong, on the ground that they had only acted professionally. The wretched sophism was silenced by the execrations of the House of Commons. "Things will never be well done," said Mr. Foley, "till some of that profession be made examples." "We have a new sort of monsters in the world," said the younger Hampden, "haranguing a man to death. These I call bloodhounds. Sawyer is very criminal and guilty of this murder." "I speak to discharge my conscience," said Mr. Garroway. "I will not have the blood of this man at my door. Sawyer demanded judgment against him and execution. I believe him guilty of the death of this man. Do what you will with him." "If the profession of the law," said the elder Hampden, "gives a man authority to murder at this rate, it is the interest of all men to rise and exterminate that profession." Nor was this language held only by unlearned country gentlemen. Sir William Williams, one of the ablest and most unscrupulous lawyers of the age, took the same view of the case. He had not hesitated, he said, to take part in the prosecution of the Bishops, because they were allowed counsel. But he maintained that, where the prisoner was not allowed counsel the Counsel for the Crown was bound to exercise a discretion, and that every lawyer who neglected this distinction was a betrayer of the law. But it is unnecessary to cite authority. It is known to everybody who has ever looked into a court of quarter-sessions that lawyers do exercise a discretion in criminal cases; and it is plain to every man of common sense that, if they did not exercise such a discretion, they would be a more hateful body of men than those bravoes who used to hire out their stilettoes in Italy. Bacon appeared against a man who was indeed guilty of a great offence, but who had been his benefactor and friend. He did more than this. Nay, he did more than a person who had never seen Essex would have been justified in doing. He employed all the art of an advocate in order to make the prisoner's conduct appear more inexcusable and more dangerous to the State than it really had been. All that professional duty could, in any case, have required of him would have been to conduct the cause so as to ensure a conviction. But from the nature of the circumstances there could not be the smallest doubt that the Earl would be found guilty. The character of the crime was unequivocal. It had been committed recently, in broad daylight, in the streets of the capital, in the presence of thousands. If ever there was an occasion on which an advocate had no temptation to resort to extraneous topics, for the purpose of blinding the judgment and inflaming the passions of a tribunal, this was that occasion. Why then resort to arguments which, while they could add nothing to the strength of the case, considered in a legal point of view, tended to aggravate the moral guilt of the fatal enterprise, and to excite fear and resentment in that quarter from which alone the Earl could now expect mercy? Why remind the audience of the arts of the ancient tyrants? Why deny what everybody knew to be the truth, that: a powerful faction at Court had long sought to effect the ruin of the prisoner? Why above all, institute a parallel between the unhappy culprit and the most wicked and most successful rebel of the age? Was it absolutely impossible to do all that professional duty required without reminding a jealous sovereign of the League, of the barricades, and of all the humiliations which a too powerful subject had heaped on Henry the Third? But if we admit the plea which Mr. Montagu urges in defence of what Bacon did as an advocate, what shall we say of the Declaration of the Treasons of Robert, Earl of Essex? Here at least there was no pretence of professional obligation. Even those who may think it the duty of a lawyer to hang, draw, and quarter his benefactors, for a proper consideration, will hardly say that it is his duty to write abusive pamphlets against them, after they are in their graves. Bacon excused himself by saying that he was not answerable for the matter of the book, and that he furnished only the language. But why did he endow such purposes with words? Could no hack writer, without virtue or shame, be found to exaggerate the errors, already so dearly expiated, of a gentle and noble spirit? Every age produces those links between the man and the baboon. Every age is fertile of Oldmixons, of Kenricks, and of Antony Pasquins. But was it for Bacon so to prostitute his intellect? Could he not feel that, while he rounded and pointed some period dictated by the envy of Cecil, or gave a plausible form to some slander invented by the dastardly malignity of Cobham; he was not sinning merely against his friend's honour and his own? Could he not feel that letters, eloquence, philosophy, were all degraded in his degradation? The real explanation of all this is perfectly obvious; and nothing but a partiality amounting to a ruling passion could cause anybody to miss it. The moral qualities of Bacon were not of a high order. We do not say that he was a bad man. He was not inhuman or tyrannical. He bore with meekness his high civil honours, and the far higher honours gained by his intellect. He was very seldom, if ever, provoked into treating any person with malignity and insolence. No man more readily held up the left cheek to those who had smitten the right. No man was more expert at the soft answer which turneth away wrath. He was never charged, by any accuser entitled to the smallest credit, with licentious habits. His even temper, his flowing courtesy, the general respectability of his demeanour, made a favourable impression on those who saw him in situations which do not severely try the principles. His faults were--we write it with pain--coldness of heart, and meanness of spirit. He seems to have been incapable of feeling strong affection, of facing great dangers, of making great sacrifices. His desires were set on things below wealth, precedence, titles, patronage, the mace, the seals, the coronet, large houses, fair gardens, rich manors, massy services of plate, gay hangings, curious cabinets, had as great attractions for him as for any of the courtiers who dropped on their knees in the dirt when Elizabeth passed by, and then hastened home to write to the King of Scots that her Grace seemed to be breaking fast. For these objects he had stooped to everything and endured everything. For these he had sued in the humblest manner, and, when unjustly and ungraciously repulsed, had thanked those who had repulsed him, and had begun to sue again. For these objects, as soon as he found that the smallest show of independence in Parliament was offensive to the Queen, he had abased himself to the dust before her, and implored forgiveness in terms better suited to a convicted thief than to a knight of the shire. For these he joined, and for these he forsook, Lord Essex. He continued to plead his patron's cause with the Queen as long as he thought that by pleading that cause he might serve himself. Nay, he went further; for his feelings, though not warm, were kind; he pleaded that cause as long as he thought that he could plead it without injury to himself. But when it became evident that Essex was going headlong to his ruin, Bacon began to tremble for his own fortunes. What he had to fear would not indeed have been very alarming to a man of lofty character. It was not death. It was not imprisonment. It was the loss of Court favour. It was the being left behind by others in the career of ambition. It was the having leisure to finish the Instauratio Magna. The Queen looked coldly on him. The courtiers began to consider him as a marked man. He determined to change his line of conduct, and to proceed in a new course with so much vigour as to make up for lost time. When once he had determined to act against his friend, knowing himself to be suspected, he acted with more zeal than would have been necessary or justifiable if he had been employed against a stranger. He exerted his professional talents to shed the Earl's blood, and his literary talents to blacken the Earl's memory. It is certain that his conduct excited at the time great and general disapprobation. While Elizabeth lived, indeed, this disapprobation, though deeply felt, was not loudly expressed. But a great change was at hand. The health of the Queen had long been decaying; and the operation of age and disease was now assisted by acute mental suffering. The pitiable melancholy of her last days has generally been ascribed to her fond regret for Essex. But we are disposed to attribute her dejection partly to physical causes, and partly to the conduct of her courtiers and ministers. They did all in their power to conceal from her the intrigues which they were carrying on at the Court of Scotland. But her keen sagacity was not to be so deceived. She did not know the whole. But she knew that she was surrounded by men who were impatient for that new world which was to begin at her death, who had never been attached to her by affection, and who were now but very slightly attached to her by interest. Prostration and flattery could not conceal from her the cruel truth, that those whom she had trusted, and promoted had never loved her, and were fast ceasing to fear her. Unable to avenge herself, and too proud to complain, she suffered sorrow and resentment to prey on her heart till, after a long  career of power, prosperity, and glory, she died sick and weary of the world. James mounted the throne: and Bacon employed all his address to obtain for himself a share of the favour of his new master. This was no difficult task. The faults of James, both as a man and as a prince, were numerous; but insensibility to the claims of genius and learning was not among them. He was indeed made up of two men, a witty, well-read scholar, who wrote, disputed, and harangued, and a nervous, drivelling idiot, who acted. If he had been a Canon of Christ Church or a Prebendary of Westminster, it is not improbable that he would have left a highly respectable name to posterity; that he would have distinguished himself among the translators of the Bible, and among the Divines who attended the Synod of Dort; and that he would have been regarded by the literary world as no contemptible rival of Vossius and Casaubon. But fortune placed him in a situation in which his weakness covered him with disgrace, and in which his accomplishments brought him no honour. In a college, much eccentricity and childishness would have been readily pardoned in so learned a man. But all that learning could do for him on the throne was to make people think him a pedant as well as a fool. Bacon was favourably received at Court; and soon found that his chance of promotion was not diminished by the death of the Queen. He was solicitous to be knighted, for two reasons which are somewhat amusing. The King had already dubbed half London, and Bacon found himself the only untitled person in his mess at Gray's Inn. This was not very agreeable to him. He had also, to quote his own words, "found an Alderman's daughter, a handsome maiden, to his liking." On both these grounds, he begged his cousin Robert Cecil, "if it might please his good Lordship," to use his interest in his behalf. The application was successful. Bacon was one of three hundred gentlemen who, on the coronation- day, received the honour, if it is to be so called, of knighthood. The handsome maiden, a daughter of Alderman Barnham, soon after consented to become Sir Francis's lady. The death of Elizabeth, though on the whole it improved Bacon's prospects, was in one respect an unfortunate event for him. The new King had always felt kindly towards Lord Essex, and, as soon as he came to the throne, began to show favour to the House of Devereux, and to those who had stood by that house in its adversity. Everybody was now at liberty to speak out respecting those lamentable events in which Bacon had borne so large a share. Elizabeth was scarcely cold when the public feeling began to manifest itself by marks of respect towards Lord Southampton. That accomplished nobleman, who will be remembered to the latest ages as the generous and discerning patron of Shakspeare, was held in honour by his contemporaries chiefly on account of the devoted affection which he had borne to Essex. He had been tried and convicted together with his friend; but the Queen had spared his life, and, at the time of her death, he was still a prisoner. A crowd of visitors hastened to the Tower to congratulate him on his approaching deliverance. With that crowd Bacon could not venture to mingle. The multitude loudly condemned him; and his conscience told him that the multitude had but too much reason. He excused himself to Southampton by letter, in terms which, if he had, as Mr. Montagu conceives, done only what as a subject and an advocate he was bound to do, must be considered as shamefully servile. He owns his fear that his attendance would give offence, and that his professions of regard would obtain no credit. "Yet," says he, "it is as true as a thing that God knoweth, that this great change hath wrought in me no other change towards your Lordship than this, that I may safely be that to you now which I was truly before." How Southampton received these apologies we are not informed. But it is certain that the general opinion was pronounced against Bacon in a manner not to be misunderstood. Soon after his marriage he put forth a defence of his conduct, in the form of a Letter to the Earl of Devon. This tract seems to us to prove only the exceeding badness of a cause for which such talents could do so little. It is not probable that Bacon's Defence had much effect on his contemporaries. But the unfavourable impression which his conduct had made appears to have been gradually effaced. Indeed it must be some very peculiar cause that can make a man like him long unpopular. His talents secured him from contempt, his temper and his manners from hatred. There is scarcely any story so black that it may not be got over by a man of great abilities, whose abilities are united with caution, good humour, patience, and affability, who pays daily sacrifice to Nemesis, who is a delightful companion, a serviceable though not an ardent friend, and a dangerous yet a placable enemy. Waller in the next generation was an eminent instance of this. Indeed Waller had much more than may at first sight appear in common with Bacon. To the higher intellectual qualities of the great English philosopher, to the genius which has made an immortal epoch in the history of science, Waller had indeed no pretensions. But the mind of Waller, as far as it extended, coincided with that of Bacon, and might, so to, speak, have been cut out of that of Bacon. In the qualities which make a man an object of interest and veneration to posterity, they cannot be compared together. But in the qualities by which chiefly a man is known to his contemporaries there was a striking similarity between them. Considered as men of the world, as courtiers, as politicians, as associates, as allies, as enemies, they had nearly the same merits, and the same defects. They were not malignant. They were not tyrannical. But they wanted warmth of affection and elevation of sentiment. There were many things which they loved better than virtue, and which they feared more than guilt. Yet, even after they had stooped to acts of which it is impossible to read the account in the most partial narratives without strong disapprobation and contempt, the public still continued to regard them with a feeling not easily to be distinguished from esteem. The hyperbole of Juliet seemed to be verified with respect to them. "Upon their brows shame was ashamed to sit." Everybody seemed as desirous to throw a veil over their misconduct as if it had been his own. Clarendon, who felt, and who had reason to feel, strong personal dislike towards Waller, speaks of him thus: "There needs no more to be said to extol the excellence and power of his wit and pleasantness of his conversation, than that it was of magnitude enough to cover a world of very great faults, that is, so to cover them that they were not taken notice of to his reproach, viz., a narrowness in his nature to the lowest degree, an abjectness and want of courage to support him in any virtuous undertaking, an insinuation and servile flattery to the height the vainest and most imperious nature could be contented with. . . . It had power to reconcile him to those whom he had most offended and provoked, and continued to his age with that rare felicity, that his company was acceptable where his spirit was odious, and he was at least pitied where he was most detested." Much of this, with some softening, might, we fear, be applied to Bacon. The influence of Waller's talents, manners, and accomplishments, died with him; and the world has pronounced an unbiassed sentence on his character. A few flowing lines are not bribe sufficient to pervert the judgment of posterity. But the influence of Bacon is felt and will long be felt over the whole civilised world. Leniently as he was treated by his contemporaries, posterity has treated him more leniently still. Turn where we may, the trophies of that mighty intellect are full in few. We are judging Manlius in sight of the Capitol. Under the reign of James, Bacon grew rapidly in fortune and favour. In 1604 he was appointed King's Counsel, with a fee of forty pounds a year; and a pension of sixty pounds a year was settled upon him. In 1607 he became Solicitor-General, in 1612 Attorney-General. He continued to distinguish himself in Parliament, particularly by his exertions in favour of one excellent measure on which the King's heart was set, the union of England and Scotland. It was not difficult for such an intellect to discover many irresistible arguments in favour of such a scheme. He conducted the great case of the Post Nati in the Exchequer Chamber; and the decision of the judges, a decision the legality of which may be questioned, but the beneficial effect of which must be acknowledged, was in a great measure attributed to his dexterous management. While actively engaged in the House of Commons and in the courts of law, he still found leisure for letters and philosophy. The noble treatise on the Advancement of Learning, which at a later period was expanded into the De Augmentis, appeared in 1605. The Wisdom of the Ancients, a work which, if it had proceeded from any other writer, would have been considered as a masterpiece of wit and learning, but which adds little to the fame of Bacon, was printed in 1609. In the meantime the Novum Organum was slowly proceeding. Several distinguished men of learning had been permitted to see sketches or detached portions of that extraordinary book; and, though they were not generally disposed to admit the soundness of the author's views, they spoke with the greatest admiration of his genius. Sir Thomas Bodley, the founder of one of the most magnificent of English libraries, was among those stubborn Conservatives who considered the hopes with which Bacon looked forward, to the future destinies of the human race as utterly chimerical, and who regarded with distrust and aversion the innovating spirit of the new schismatics in philosophy. Yet even Bodley, after perusing the Cogitata et Visa, one of the most precious of those scattered leaves out of which the great oracular volume was afterwards made up, acknowledged that in "those very points, and in all proposals and plots in that book, Bacon showed himself a master-workman"; and that "it could not be gainsaid but all the treatise over did abound with choice conceits of the present state of learning, and with worthy contemplations of the means to procure it." In 1612 a new edition of the Essays appeared, with additions surpassing the original collection both in bulk and quality. Nor did these pursuits distract Bacon's attention from a work the most arduous, the most glorious, and the most useful that even his mighty powers could have achieved, "the reducing and recompiling," to use his own phrase, "of the laws of England." Unhappily he was at that very time employed in perverting those laws to the vilest purposes of tyranny. When Oliver St. John was brought before the Star Chamber for maintaining that the King had no right to levy Benevolences, and was for his manly and constitutional conduct sentenced to imprisonment during the royal pleasure and to a fine of five thousand pounds, Bacon appeared as counsel for the prosecution. About the same time he was deeply engaged in a still more disgraceful transaction. An aged clergyman, of the name of Peacham, was accused of treason on account of some passages of a sermon which was found in his study. The sermon, whether written by him or not, had never been preached. It did not appear that he had any intention of preaching it. The most servile lawyers of those servile times were forced to admit that there were great difficulties both as to the facts and as to the law. Bacon was employed to remove those difficulties. He was employed to settle the question of law by tampering with the judges, and the question of fact by torturing the prisoner. Three judges of the Court of King's Bench were tractable. But Coke was made of different stuff. Pedant, bigot, and brute as he was, he had qualities which bore a strong, though a very disagreeable resemblance to some of the highest virtues which a public man can possess. He was an exception to a maxim which we believe to be generally true, that those who trample on the helpless are disposed to cringe to the powerful. He behaved with gross rudeness to his juniors at the bar, and with execrable cruelty to prisoners on trial for their lives. But he stood up manfully against the King and the King's favourites. No man of that age appeared to so little advantage when he was opposed to an inferior, and was in the wrong. But, on the other hand, it is but fair to admit that no man of that age made so creditable a figure when he was opposed to a superior, and happened to be in the right. On such occasions, his half-suppressed insolence and his impracticable obstinacy had a respectable and interesting appearance, when compared with the abject servility of the bar and of the bench. On the present occasion he was stubborn and surly. He declared that it was a new and highly improper practice in the judges to confer with a law-officer of the Crown about capital cases which they were afterwards to try; and for some time he resolutely kept aloof. But Bacon was equally artful and persevering. "I am not wholly out of hope," said he in a letter to the King, "that my Lord Coke himself, when I have in some dark manner put him in doubt that he shall be left alone, will not be singular." After some time Bacon's dexterity was successful; and Coke, sullenly and reluctantly, followed the example of his brethren. But in order to convict Peacham it was necessary to find facts as well as law. Accordingly, this wretched old man was put to the rack, and, while undergoing the horrible infliction, was examined by Bacon, but in vain. No confession could be wrung out of him; and Bacon wrote to the King, complaining that Peacham had a dumb devil. At length the trial came on. A conviction was obtained; but the charges were so obviously futile, that the Government could not, for very shame, carry the sentence into execution; and Peacham, was suffered to languish away the short remainder of his life in a prison. All this frightful story Mr. Montagu relates fairly. He neither conceals nor distorts any material fact. But he can see nothing deserving of condemnation in Bacon's conduct. He tells us most truly that we ought not to try the men of one age by the standard of another; that Sir Matthew Hale is not to be pronounced a bad man because he left a woman to be executed for witchcraft; that posterity will not be justified in censuring judges of our time, for selling offices in their courts, according to the established practice, bad as that practice was; and that Bacon is entitled to similar indulgence. "To persecute the lover of truth," says Mr. Montagu, "for opposing established customs, and to censure him in after ages for not having been more strenuous in opposition, are errors which will never cease until the pleasure of self- elevation from the depression of superiority is no more." We have no dispute with Mr. Montagu about the general proposition. We assent to every word of it. But does it apply to the present case? Is it true that in the time of James the First it was the established practice for the law-officers of the Crown to hold private consultations with the judges, touching capital cases which those judges were afterwards to try? Certainly not. In the very page in which Mr. Montagu asserts that "the influencing a judge out of court seems at that period scarcely to have been considered as improper," he give the very words of Sir Edward Coke on the subject. "I will not thus declare what may be my judgment by these auricular confessions of new and pernicious tendency, and not according to the customs of the realm." Is it possible to imagine that Coke, who had himself been Attorney-General during thirteen years, who had conducted a far greater number of important State prosecutions than any other lawyer named in English history, and who had passed with scarcely any interval from the Attorney-Generalship to the first seat in the first criminal court in the realm, could have been startled at an invitation to confer with the Crown-lawyers, and could have pronounced the practice new, if it had really been an established usage? We well know that, where property only was at stake, it was then a common, though a most culpable practice, in the judges, to listen to private solicitation. But the practice of tampering with judges in order to procure capita; convictions we believe to have been new, first, because Coke, who understood those matters better than any man of his time, asserted it to be new; and secondly, because neither Bacon nor Mr. Montagu has shown a single precedent. How then stands the case? Even thus: Bacon was not conforming to an usage then generally admitted to be proper. He was not even the last lingering adherent of an old abuse. It would have been sufficiently disgraceful to such a man to be in this last situation. Yet this last situation would have been honourable compared with that in which he stood. He was guilty of attempting to introduce into the courts of law an odious abuse for which no precedent could be found. Intellectually, he was better fitted than any man that England has ever produced for the work of improving her institutions. But, unhappily, we see that he did not scruple to exert his great powers for the purpose of introducing into those institutions new corruptions of the foulest kind. The same, or nearly the same, may be said of the torturing of Peacham. If it be true that in the time of James the First the propriety of torturing prisoners was generally allowed, we should admit this as an excuse, though we should admit it less readily in the case of such a man as Bacon than in the case of an ordinary lawyer or politician. But the fact is, that the practice of torturing prisoners was then generally acknowledged by lawyers to be illegal, and was execrated by the public as barbarous. More than thirty years before Peacham's trial, that practice was so loudly condemned by the voice of the nation that Lord Burleigh found it necessary to publish an apology for having occasionally resorted to it. But, though the dangers which then threatened the Government were of a very different kind from those which were to be apprehended from anything that Peacham could write, though the life of the Queen and the dearest interests of the State were in jeopardy, though the circumstances were such that all ordinary laws might seem to be superseded by that highest law, the public safety, the apology did not satisfy the country; and the Queen found it expedient to issue an order positively forbidding the torturing of State-prisoners on any pretence whatever. From that time, the practice of torturing, which had always been unpopular, which had always been illegal, had also been unusual. It is well known that in 1628, only fourteen years after the time when Bacon went to the Tower to listen to the yells of Peacham, the judges decided that Felton, a criminal who neither deserved nor was likely to obtain any extraordinary indulgence, could not lawfully be put to the question. We therefore say that Bacon stands in a very different situation from that in which Mr. Montagu tries to place him. Bacon was here distinctly behind his age. He was one of the last of the tools of power who persisted in a practice the most barbarous and the most absurd that has ever disgraced jurisprudence, in a practice of which, in the preceding generation, Elizabeth and her Ministers had been ashamed, in a practice which, a few years later, no sycophant in all the Inns of Court had the heart or the forehead to defend. [Since this Review was written, Mr. Jardine has published a very learned and ingenious Reading on the use of torture in England. It has not, however, been thought necessary to make any change in the observations on Peacham's case. It is impossible to discuss within the limits of a note, the extensive question raised by Mr. Jardine. It is sufficient here to say that every argument by which he attempts to show that the use of the rack was anciently a lawful exertion of royal prerogative may be urged with equal force, nay, with far greater force, to prove the lawfulness of benevolences, of ship-money, of Mompesson's patent, of Eliot's imprisonment, of every abuse, without exception, which is condemned by the Petition of Right and the Declaration of Right.] Bacon far behind his age! Bacon far behind Sir Edward Coke! Bacon clinging to exploded abuses! Bacon withstanding the progress of improvement! Bacon struggling to push back the human mind! The words seem strange. They sound like a contradiction in terms. Yet the fact is even so: and the explanation may be readily found by any person who is not blinded by prejudice. Mr. Montagu cannot believe that so extraordinary a man as Bacon could be guilty of a bad action; as if history were not made up of the bad actions of extraordinary men, as if all the most noted destroyers and deceivers of our species, all the founders of arbitrary governments and false religions, had not been extraordinary men, as if nine-tenths of the calamities which have befallen the human race had any other origin than the union of high intelligence with low desires. Bacon knew this well. He has told us that there are persons "scientia tanquam angeli alati, cupiditatibus vero tanquam serpentes qui humi reptant"; [De Augmentis, Lib. v. Cap. I.] and it did not require his admirable sagacity and his extensive converse with mankind to make the discovery. Indeed, he had only to look within. The difference between the soaring angel and the creeping snake was but a type of the difference between Bacon the philosopher and Bacon the Attorney-General, Bacon seeking for truth, and Bacon seeking for the Seals. Those who survey only one-half of his character may speak of him with unmixed admiration or with unmixed contempt. But those only judge of him correctly who take in at one view Bacon in speculation and Bacon in action. They will have no difficulty in comprehending how one and the same man should have been far above his age and far behind it, in one line the boldest and most useful of innovators, in another one the most obstinate champion of the foulest abuses. In his library, all his rare powers were under the guidance of an honest ambition, of all enlarged philanthropy, of a sincere love of truth. There, no temptation drew him away from the right course. Thomas Aquinas could pay no fees. Duns Scotus could confer no peerages. The Master of the Sentences had no rich reversions in his gift. Far different was the situation of the great philosopher when he came forth from his study and his laboratory to mingle with the crowd which filled the galleries of Whitehall. In all that crowd there was no man equally qualified to render great and lasting services to mankind. But in all that crowd there was not a heart more set on things which no man ought to suffer to be necessary to his happiness, on things which can often be obtained only by the sacrifice of integrity and honour. To be the leader of the human race in the career of improvement, to found on the ruins of ancient intellectual dynasties a more prosperous and a more enduring empire, to be revered by the latest generations as the most illustrious among the benefactors of mankind, all this was within his reach, But all this availed him nothing, while some quibbling special pleader was promoted before him to the bench, while some heavy country gentleman took precedence of him by virtue of a purchased coronet, while some pandar, happy in a fair wife, could obtain a more cordial salute from Buckingham, while some buffoon, versed in all the latest scandal of the Court, could draw a louder laugh from James. During a long course of years, Bacon's unworthy ambition was crowned with success. His sagacity early enabled him to perceive who was likely to become the most powerful man in the kingdom. He probably knew the King's mind before it was known to the King himself, and attached himself to Villiers, while the less discerning crowd of courtiers still continued to fawn on Somerset, The influence of the younger favourite became greater daily. The contest between the rivals might, however, have lasted long, but for that frightful crime which, in spite of all that could be effected by the research and ingenuity of historians, is still covered with so mysterious an obscurity. The descent of Somerset had been a gradual and almost imperceptible lapse. It now became a headlong fall; and Villiers, left without a competitor, rapidly rose to a height of power such as no subject since Wolsey had attained. There were many points of resemblance between the two celebrated courtiers who, at different times, extended their patronage to Bacon. It is difficult to say whether Essex or Villiers was more eminently distinguished by those graces of person and manner which have always been rated in courts at much more than their real value. Both were constitutionally brave; and both, like most men who are constitutionally brave, were open and unreserved. Both were rash and head-strong. Both were destitute of the abilities and of the information which are necessary to statesmen. Yet both, trusting to the accomplishments which had made them conspicuous in tilt-yards and ball-rooms, aspired to rule the State. Both owed their elevation to the personal attachment of the sovereign; and in both cases this attachment was of so eccentric a kind, that it perplexed observers, that it still continues to perplex historians, and that it gave rise to much scandal which we are inclined to think unfounded. Each of them treated the sovereign whose favour he enjoyed with a rudeness which approached to insolence. This petulance ruined Essex, who had to deal with a spirit naturally as proud as his own, and accustomed, during near half a century, to the most respectful observance. But there was a wide difference between the haughty daughter of Henry and her successor. James was timid from the cradle. His nerves, naturally weak, had not been fortified by reflection or by habit. His life, till he came to England, had been a series of mortifications and humiliations. With all his high notions of the origin and extent of his prerogatives, he was never his own master for a day. In spite of his kingly title, in spite of his despotic theories, he was to the last a slave at heart. Villiers treated him like one; and this course, though adopted, we believe, merely from temper, succeeded as well as if it had been a system of policy formed after mature deliberation. In generosity, in sensibility, in capacity for friendship, Essex far surpassed Buckingham. Indeed, Buckingham can scarcely be said to have had any friend, with the exception of the two princes over whom successively he exercised so wonderful an influence. Essex was to the last adored by the people. Buckingham was always a most unpopular man, except perhaps for a very short time after his return from the childish visit to Spain. Essex fell a victim to the rigour of the Government amidst the lamentations of the people. Buckingham, execrated by the people, and solemnly declared a public enemy by the representatives of the people, fell by the hand of one of the people, and was lamented by none but his master. The way in which the two favourites acted towards Bacon was highly characteristic, and may serve to illustrate the old and true saying, that a man is generally more inclined to feel kindly towards one on whom he has conferred favours than towards one from whom he has received them. Essex loaded Bacon with benefits, and never thought that he had done enough. It seems never to have crossed the mind of the powerful and wealthy noble that the poor barrister whom he treated with such munificent kindness was not his equal. It was, we have no doubt, with perfect sincerity that the Earl declared that he would willingly give his sister or daughter in marriage to his friend. He was in general more than sufficiently sensible of his own merits; but he did not seem to know that he had ever deserved well of Bacon. On that cruel day when they saw each other for the last time at the bar of the Lords, Essex taxed his perfidious friend with unkindness and insincerity, but never with ingratitude. Even in such a moment, more bitter than the bitterness of death, that noble heart was too great to vent itself in such a reproach. Villiers, on the other hand, owed much to Bacon. When their acquaintance began, Sir Francis was a man of mature age, of high station, and of established fame as a politician, an advocate, and a writer. Villiers was little more than a boy, a younger son of a house then of no great note. He was but just entering on the career of court favour; and none but the most discerning observers could as yet perceive that he was likely to distance all his competitors. The countenance and advice of a man so highly distinguished as the Attorney-General, must have been an object of the highest importance to the young adventurer. But though Villiers was the obliged party, he was far less warmly attached to Bacon, and far less delicate in his conduct towards Bacon, than Essex had been. To do the new favourite justice, he early exerted his influence in behalf of his illustrious friend. In 1616 Sir Francis was sworn of the Privy Council, and in March 1617, on the retirement of Lord Brackley, was appointed Keeper of the Great Seal. On the seventh of May, the first day of term, he rode in state to Westminster Hall, with the Lord Treasurer on his right hand, the Lord Privy Seal on his left, a long procession of students and ushers before him, and a crowd of peers, privy-councillors, and judges following in his train. Having entered his court, he addressed the splendid auditory in a grave and dignified speech, which proves how well he understood those judicial duties which he afterwards performed so ill. Even at that moment, the proudest moment of his life in the estimation of the vulgar, and, it may be, even in his own, he cast back a look of lingering affection towards those noble pursuits from which, as it seemed, he was about to be estranged. "The depth of the three long vacations," said he, "I would reserve in some measure free from business of estate, and for studies, arts, and sciences, to which of my own nature I am most inclined." The years during which Bacon held the Great Seal were among the darkest and most shameful in English history. Everything at home and abroad was mismanaged. First came the execution of Raleigh, an act which, if done in a proper manner, might have been defensible, but which, under all the circumstances, must be considered as a dastardly murder. Worse was behind: the war of Bohemia, the successes of Tilly and Spinola, the Palatinate conquered, the King's son-in-law an exile, the House of Austria dominant on the Continent, the Protestant religion and the liberties of the Germanic body trodden under foot. Meanwhile, the wavering and cowardly policy of England furnished matter of ridicule to all the nations of Europe. The love of peace which James professed would, even when indulged to an impolitic excess, have been respectable, if it had proceeded from tenderness for his people. But the truth is, that, while he had nothing to spare for the defence of the natural allies of England, he resorted without scruple to the most illegal and oppressive devices, for the purpose of enabling Buckingham and Buckingham's relations to outshine the ancient aristocracy of the realm. Benevolences were exacted. Patents of monopoly were multiplied. All the resources which could have been employed to replenish a beggared exchequer, at the close of a ruinous war, were put in motion during this season of ignominious peace. The vices of the administration must be chiefly ascribed to the weakness of the King and to the levity and violence of the favourite. But it is impossible to acquit the Lord Keeper of all share in the guilt. For those odious patents, in particular, which passed the Great Seal while it was in his charge, he must be held answerable. In the speech which he made on first taking his seat in his court, he had pledged himself to discharge this important part of his functions with the greatest caution and impartiality. He had declared that he "would walk in the light," "that men should see that no particular turn or end led him, but a general rule." Mr. Montagu would have us believe that Bacon acted up to these professions, and says that "the power of the favourite did not deter the Lord Keeper from staying grants and patents when his public duty demanded this interposition." Does Mr. Montagu consider patents of monopoly as good things? or does he mean to say that Bacon staid every patent of monopoly that came before him? Of all patents in our history, the most disgraceful was that which was granted to Sir Giles Mompesson, supposed to be the original of Massinger's Overreach, and to Sir Francis Michell, from whom justice Greedy is supposed to have been drawn, for the exclusive manufacturing of gold and silver lace. The effect of this monopoly was of course that the metal employed in the manufacture was adulterated, to the great loss of the public. But this was a trifle. The patentees were armed with powers as great as have ever been given to farmers of the revenue in the worst governed countries. They were authorised to search houses and to arrest interlopers; and these formidable powers were used for purposes viler than even those for which they were given, for the wreaking of old grudges, and for the corrupting of female chastity. Was not this a case in which public duty demanded the interposition of the Lord Keeper? And did the Lord Keeper interpose? He did. He wrote to inform the King, that he "had considered of the fitness and conveniency of the gold and silver thread business," "that it was convenient that it should be settled," that he "did conceive apparent likelihood that it would redound much to his Majesty's profit," that, therefore, "it were good it were settled with all convenient speed." The meaning of all this was, that certain of the House of Villiers were to go shares with Overreach and Greedy in the plunder of the public. This was the way in which, when the favourite pressed for patents, lucrative to his relations and to his creatures, ruinous and vexatious to the body of the people, the chief guardian of the laws interposed. Having assisted the patentees to obtain this monopoly, Bacon assisted them also in the steps which they took for the purpose of guarding it. He committed several people to close confinement for disobeying his tyrannical edict. It is needless to say more. Our readers are now able to judge whether, in the matter of patents, Bacon acted conformably to his professions, or deserved the praise which his biographer has bestowed on him. In his judicial capacity his conduct was not less reprehensible. He suffered Buckingham to dictate many of his decisions. Bacon knew as well as any man that a judge who listens to private solicitations is a disgrace to his post. He himself, before he was raised to the woolsack, represented this strongly to Villiers, then just entering on his career. "By no means," said Sir Francis, in a letter of advice addressed to the young courtier, "by no means be you persuaded to interpose yourself, either by word or letter, in any cause depending in any court of justice, nor suffer any great man to do it where you can hinder it. If it should prevail, it perverts justice; but if the judge be so just, and of such courage as he ought to be, as not to be inclined thereby, yet it always leaves a taint of suspicion behind it." Yet he had not been Lord Keeper a month when Buckingham began to interfere in Chancery suits; and Buckingham's interference was, as might have been expected, successful. Mr. Montagu's reflections on the excellent passage which we have quoted above are exceedingly amusing. "No man," says he, "more deeply felt the evils which then existed of the interference of the Crown and of statesmen to influence judges. How beautifully did he admonish Buckingham, regardless as he proved of all admonition!" We should be glad to know how it can be expected that admonition will be regarded by him who receives it, when it is altogether neglected by him who gives it. We do not defend Buckingham; but what was his guilt to Bacon's? Buckingham was young, ignorant, thoughtless, dizzy with the rapidity of his ascent and the height of his position. That he should be eager to serve his relations, his flatterers, his mistresses, that he should not fully apprehend the immense importance of a pure administration of justice, that he should think more about those who were bound to him by private ties than about the public interest, all this was perfectly natural, and not altogether unpardonable. Those who intrust a petulant, hot-blooded, ill- informed lad with power, are more to blame than he for the mischief which he may do with it. How could it be expected of a lively page, raised by a wild freak of fortune to the first influence in the empire, that he should have bestowed any serious thought on the principles which ought to guide judicial decisions? Bacon was the ablest public man then living in Europe. He was near sixty years old. He had thought much, and to good purpose, on the general principles of law. He had for many years borne a part daily in the administration of justice. It was impossible that a man with a tithe of his sagacity and experience should not have known that a judge who suffers friends or patrons to dictate his decrees violates the plainest rules of duty. In fact, as we have seen, he knew this well: he expressed it admirably. Neither on this occasion nor on any other could his bad actions be attributed to any defect of the head. They sprang from quite a different cause. A man who stooped to render such services to others was not likely to be scrupulous as to the means by which he enriched himself. He and his dependants accepted large presents from persons who were engaged in Chancery suits. The amount of the plunder which he collected in this way it is impossible to estimate. There can be no doubt that he received very much more than was proved on his trial, though, it may be, less than was suspected by the public. His enemies stated his illicit gains at a hundred thousand pounds. But this was probably an exaggeration. It was long before the day of reckoning arrived. During the interval between the second and third Parliaments of James, the nation was absolutely governed by the Crown. The prospects of the Lord Keeper were bright and serene. His great place rendered the splendour of his talents even more conspicuous, and gave an additional charm to the serenity of his temper, the courtesy of his manners, and the eloquence of his conversation. The pillaged suitor might mutter. The austere Puritan patriot might, in his retreat, grieve that one on whom God had bestowed without measure all the abilities which qualify men to take the lead in great reforms should be found among the adherents of the worst abuses. But the murmurs of the suitor and the lamentations of the patriot had scarcely any avenue to the ears of the powerful. The King, and the Minister who was the King's master, smiled on their illustrious flatterer. The whole crowd of courtiers and nobles sought his favour with emulous eagerness. Men of wit and learning hailed with delight the elevation of one who had so signally shown that a man of profound learning and of brilliant wit might understand, far better than any plodding dunce, the art of thriving in the world. Once, and but once, this course of prosperity was for a moment interrupted. It would seem that even Bacon's brain was not strong enough to bear without some discomposure the inebriating effect of so much good fortune. For some time after his elevation, he showed himself a little wanting in that wariness and self-command to which, more than even to his transcendent talents, his elevation was to be ascribed. He was by no means a good hater. The temperature of his revenge, like that of his gratitude, was scarcely ever more than lukewarm. But there was one person whom he had long regarded with an animosity which, though studiously suppressed, was perhaps the stronger for the suppression. The insults and injuries which, when a young man struggling into note and professional practice, he had received from Sir Edward Coke, were such as might move the most placable nature to resentment. About the time at which Bacon received the Seals, Coke had, on account of his contumacious resistance to the royal pleasure, been deprived of his seat in the Court of King's Bench, and had ever since languished in retirement. But Coke's opposition to the Court, we fear, was the effect not of good principles, but of a bad temper. Perverse and testy as he was, he wanted true fortitude and dignity of character. His obstinacy, unsupported by virtuous motives, was not proof against disgrace. He solicited a reconciliation with the favourite, and his solicitations were successful. Sir John Villiers, the brother of Buckingham, was looking out for a rich wife. Coke had a large fortune and an unmarried daughter. A bargain was struck. But Lady Coke, the lady whom twenty years before Essex had wooed on behalf of Bacon, would not hear of the match. A violent and scandalous family quarrel followed. The mother carried the girl away by stealth. The father pursued them, and regained possession of his daughter by force. The King was then in Scotland, and Buckingham had attended him thither. Bacon was during their absence at the head of affairs in England. He felt towards Coke as much malevolence as it was in his nature to feel towards anybody. His wisdom had been laid to sleep by prosperity. In an evil hour he determined to interfere in the disputes which agitated his enemy's household. He declared for the wife, countenanced the Attorney- General in the filing an information in the Star-Chamber against the husband, and wrote letters to the King and the favourite against the proposed marriage. The strong language which he used in those letters shows that, sagacious as he was, he did not quite know his place, and that he was not fully acquainted with the extent either of Buckingham's power, or of the change which the possession of that power had produced in Buckingham's character. He soon had a lesson which he never forgot. The favourite received the news of the Lord Keeper's interference with feelings of the most violent resentment, and made the King even more angry than himself. Bacon's eyes were at once opened to his error, and to all its possible consequences. He had been elated, if not intoxicated, by greatness. The shock sobered him in an instant. He was all himself again. He apologised submissively for his interference. He directed the Attorney-General to stop the proceedings against Coke. He sent to tell Lady Coke that he could do nothing for her. He announced to both the families that he was desirous to promote the connection. Having given these proofs of contrition, he ventured to present himself before Buckingham. But the young upstart did not think that he had yet sufficiently humbled an old man who had been his friend and his benefactor, who was the highest civil functionary in the realm, and the most eminent man of letters of the world. It is said that on two successive days Bacon repaired to Buckingham's house, that on two successive days he was suffered to remain in an antechamber among footboys, seated on an old wooden box, with the Great Seal of England at his side; and that when at length he was admitted, he flung himself on the floor, kissed the favourite's feet, and vowed never to rise till he was forgiven. Sir Anthony Weldon, on whose authority this story rests, is likely enough to have exaggerated the meanness of Bacon and the insolence of Buckingham. But it is difficult to imagine that so circumstantial a narrative, written by a person who avers that he was present on the occasion, can be wholly without foundation; and, unhappily, there is little in the character either of the favourite or of the Lord Keeper to make the narrative improbable. It is certain that a reconciliation took place on terms humiliating to Bacon, who never more ventured to cross any purpose of anybody who bore the name of Villiers. He put a strong curb on those angry passions which had for the first time in his life mastered his prudence. He went through the forms of a reconciliation with Coke, and did his best, by seeking opportunities of paying little civilities, and by avoiding all that could produce collision, to tame the untameable ferocity of his old enemy. In the main, however, Bacon's life, while he held the Great Seal, was, in outward appearance, most enviable. In London he lived with great dignity at York House, the venerable mansion of his father. Here it was that, in January 1620, he celebrated his entrance into his sixtieth year amidst a splendid circle of friends. He had then exchanged the appellation of Keeper for the higher title of Chancellor. Ben Jonson was one of the party, and wrote on the occasion some of the happiest of his rugged rhymes. All things, he tells us, seemed to smile about the old house, "the fire, the wine, the men." The spectacle of the accomplished host, after a life marked by no great disaster, entered on a green old age, in the enjoyment of riches, power, high honours, undiminished mental activity, and vast literary reputation, made a strong impression on the poet, if we may judge from those well- known lines: "England's high Chancellor, the destined heir, In his soft cradle, to his father's chair, Whose even thread the Fates spin round and full Out of their choicest and their whitest wool." In the intervals of rest which Bacon's political and judicial functions afforded, he was in the habit of retiring to Gorhambury. At that place his business was literature, and his favourite amusement gardening, which in one of his most interesting Essays he calls "the purest of human pleasures." In his magnificent grounds he erected, at a cost of ten thousand pounds, a retreat to which he repaired when he wished to avoid all visitors, and to devote himself wholly to study. On such occasions, a few young men of distinguished talents were sometimes the companions of his retirement; and among them his quick eye soon discerned the superior abilities of Thomas Hobbes. It is not probable, however, that he fully appreciated the powers of his disciple, or foresaw the vast influence, both for good and for evil, which that most vigorous and acute of human intellects was destined to exercise on the two succeeding generations. In January 1621, Bacon had reached the zenith of his fortunes. He had just published the Novum Organum; and that extraordinary book had drawn forth the warmest expressions of admiration from the ablest men in Europe. He had obtained honours of a widely different kind, but perhaps not less valued by him. He had been created Baron Verulam. He had subsequently been raised to the higher dignity of Viscount St. Albans. His patent was drawn in the most flattering terms, and the Prince of Wales signed it as a witness. The ceremony of investiture was performed with great state at Theobalds, and Buckingham condescended to be one of the chief actors. Posterity has felt that the greatest of English philosophers could derive no accession of dignity from any title which James could bestow, and, in defiance of the royal letters patent, has obstinately refused to degrade Francis Bacon into Viscount St. Albans. In a few weeks was signally brought to the test the value of those objects for which Bacon had sullied his integrity, had resigned his independence, had violated the most sacred obligations of friendship and gratitude, had flattered the worthless, had persecuted the innocent, had tampered with judges, had tortured prisoners, had plundered suitors, had wasted on paltry intrigues all the powers of the most exquisitely constructed intellect that has ever been bestowed on any of the children of men. A sudden and terrible reverse was at hand. A Parliament had been summoned. After six years of silence the voice of the nation was again to be heard. Only three days after the pageant which was performed at Theobalds in honour of Bacon, the Houses met. Want of money had, as usual, induced the King to convoke his Parliament. It may be doubted, however, whether, if he or his Ministers had been at all aware of the state of public feeling, they would not have tried any expedient, or borne with any inconvenience, rather than have ventured to face the deputies of a justly exasperated nation. But they did not discern those times. Indeed almost all the political blunders of James, and of his more unfortunate son, arose from one great error. During the fifty years which preceded the Long Parliament a great and progressive change was taking place in the public mind. The nature and extent of this change was not in the least understood by either of the first two Kings of the House of Stuart, or by any of their advisers. That the nation became more and more discontented every year, that every House of Commons was more unmanageable than that which had preceded it, were facts which it was impossible not to perceive. But the Court could not understand why these things were so. The Court could not see that the English people and the English Government, though they might once have been well suited to each other, were suited to each other no longer; that the nation had outgrown its old institutions, was every day more uneasy under them, was pressing against them, and would soon burst through them. The alarming phaenomena, the existence of which no sycophant could deny, were ascribed to every cause except the true one. "In my first Parliament," said James, "I was a novice. In my next, there was a kind of beasts called undertakers" and so forth. In the third Parliament he could hardly be called a novice, and those beasts, the undertakers, did not exist. Yet his third Parliament gave him more trouble than either the first or the second. The Parliament had no sooner met than the House of Commons proceeded, in a temperate and respectful, but most determined manner, to discuss the public grievances. Their first attacks were directed against those odious patents, under cover of which Buckingham and his creatures had pillaged and oppressed the nation. The vigour with which these proceedings were conducted spread dismay through the Court. Buckingham thought himself in danger, and, in his alarm, had recourse to an adviser who had lately acquired considerable influence over him, Williams, Dean of Westminster. This person had already been of great use to the favourite in a very delicate matter. Buckingham had set his heart on marrying Lady Catherine Manners, daughter and heiress of the Earl of Rutland. But the difficulties were great. The Earl was haughty and impracticable, and the young lady was a Catholic. Williams soothed the pride of the father, and found arguments which, for a time at least, quieted the conscience of the daughter. For these services he had been rewarded with considerable preferment in the Church; and he was now rapidly rising to the same place in the regard of Buckingham which had formerly been occupied by Bacon. Williams was one of those who are wiser for others than for themselves. His own public life was unfortunate, and was made unfortunate by his strange want of judgment and self-command at several important conjunctures. But the counsel which he gave on this occasion showed no want of worldly wisdom. He advised the favourite to abandon all thoughts of defending the monopolies, to find some foreign embassy for his brother Sir Edward, who was deeply implicated in the villanies of Mompesson, and to leave the other offenders to the justice of Parliament. Buckingham received this advice with the warmest expressions of gratitude, and declared that a load had been lifted from his heart. He then repaired with Williams to the royal presence. They found the King engaged in earnest consultation with Prince Charles. The plan of operations proposed by the Dean was fully discussed, and approved in all its parts. The first victims whom the Court abandoned to the vengeance of the Commons were Sir Giles Mompesson and Sir Francis Michell. It was some time before Bacon began to entertain any apprehensions. His talents and his address gave him great influence in the House of which he had lately become a member, as indeed they must have done in any assembly. In the House of Commons he had many personal friends and many warm admirers. But at length, about six weeks after the meeting of Parliament, the storm burst. A committee of the lower House had been appointed to inquire into the state of the Courts of Justice. On the fifteenth of March the chairman of that committee, Sir Robert Philips, member for Bath, reported that great abuses had been discovered. "The person," said he, "against whom these things are alleged is no less than the Lord Chancellor, a man so endued with all parts, both of nature and art, as that I will say no more of him, being not able to say enough." Sir Robert then proceeded to state, in the most temperate manner, the nature of the charges. A person of the name of Aubrey had a case depending in Chancery. He had been almost ruined by law expenses, and his patience had been exhausted by the delays of the court. He received a hint from some of the hangers-on of the Chancellor that a present of one hundred pounds would expedite matters. The poor man had not the sum required. However, having found out an usurer who accommodated him with it at high interest, he carried it to York House. The Chancellor took the money, and his dependants assured the suitor that all would go right. Aubrey was, however, disappointed; for, after considerable delay, "a killing decree" was pronounced against him. Another suitor of the name of Egerton complained that he had been induced by two of the Chancellor's jackals to make his Lordship a present of four hundred pounds, and that, nevertheless, he had not been able to obtain a decree in his favour. The evidence to these facts was overwhelming. Bacon's friends could only entreat the House to suspend its judgment, and to send up the case to the Lords, in a form less offensive than an impeachment. On the nineteenth of March the King sent a message to the Commons, expressing his deep regret that so eminent a person as the Chancellor should be suspected of misconduct. His Majesty declared that he had no wish to screen the guilty from justice, and proposed to appoint a new kind of tribunal consisting of eighteen commissioners, who might be chosen from among the members of the two Houses, to investigate the matter. The Commons were not disposed to depart from their regular course of proceeding. On the same day they held a conference with the Lords, and delivered in the heads of the accusation against the Chancellor. At this conference Bacon was not present. Overwhelmed with shame and remorse, and abandoned by all those in whom he had weakly put his trust, he had shut himself up in his chamber from the eyes of men. The dejection of his mind soon disordered his body. Buckingham, who visited him by the King's order, "found his Lordship very sick and heavy." It appears, from a pathetic letter which the unhappy man addressed to the Peers on the day of the conference, that he neither expected nor wished to survive his disgrace. During several days he remained in his bed, refusing to see any human being. He passionately told his attendants to leave him, to forget him, never again to name his name, never to remember that there had been such a man in the world. In the meantime, fresh instances of corruption were every day brought to the knowledge of his accusers. The number of charges rapidly increased from two to twenty-three. The Lords entered on the investigation of the case with laudable alacrity. Some witnesses were examined at the bar of the House. A select committee was appointed to take the depositions of others; and the inquiry was rapidly proceeding, when on the twenty-sixth of March, the King adjourned the Parliament for three weeks. This measure revived Bacon's hopes. He made the most of his short respite. He attempted to work on the feeble mind of the King. He appealed to all the strongest feelings of James, to his fears, to his vanity, to his high notions of prerogative. Would the Solomon of the age commit so gross an error as to encourage the encroaching spirit of Parliaments? Would God's anointed, accountable to God alone, pay homage to the clamorous multitude? "Those," exclaimed Bacon, "who now strike at the Chancellor will soon strike at the Crown. I am the first sacrifice. I wish I may be the last." But all his eloquence and address were employed in vain. Indeed, whatever Mr. Montagu may say, we are firmly convinced that it was not in the King's power to save Bacon, without having recourse to measures which would have convulsed the realm. The Crown had not sufficient influence over the Parliament to procure an acquittal in so clear a case of guilt. And to dissolve a Parliament which is universally allowed to have been one of the best Parliaments that ever sat, which had acted liberally and respectfully towards the Sovereign, and which enjoyed in the highest degree the favour of the people, only in order to stop a grave, temperate, and constitutional inquiry into the personal integrity of the first judge in the kingdom, would have been a measure more scandalous and absurd than any of those which were the ruin of the House of Stuart. Such a measure, while it would have been as fatal to the Chancellor's honour as a conviction, would have endangered the very existence of the monarchy. The King, acting by the advice of Williams, very properly refused to engage in a dangerous struggle with his people, for the purpose of saving from legal condemnation a Minister whom it was impossible to save from dishonour. He advised Bacon to plead guilty, and promised to do all in his power to mitigate the punishment. Mr. Montagu is exceedingly angry with James on this account. But though we are, in general, very little inclined to admire that Prince's conduct, we really think that his advice was, under all the circumstances, the best advice that could have been given. On the seventeenth of April the Houses reassembled, and the Lords resumed their inquiries into the abuses of the Court of Chancery. On the twenty-second, Bacon addressed to the Peers a letter, which the Prince of Wales condescended to deliver. In this artful and pathetic composition, the Chancellor acknowledged his guilt in guarded and general terms, and, while acknowledging, endeavoured to palliate it. This, however, was not thought sufficient by his judges. They required a more particular confession, and sent him a copy of the charges. On the thirtieth, he delivered a paper in which he admitted, with few and unimportant reservations, the truth of the accusations brought against him, and threw himself entirely on the mercy of his peers. "Upon advised consideration of the charges," said he, "descending into my own conscience, and calling my memory to account so far as I am able, I do plainly and ingenuously confess that I am guilty of corruption, and do renounce all defence." The Lords came to a resolution that the Chancellor's confession appeared to be full and ingenuous, and sent a committee to inquire of him whether it was really subscribed by himself. The deputies, among whom was Southampton, the common friend, many years before, of Bacon and Essex, performed their duty with great delicacy. Indeed, the agonies of such a mind and the degradation of such a name might well have softened the most obdurate natures. "My Lords," said Bacon, "it is my act, my hand, my heart. I beseech your Lordships to be merciful to a broken reed." They withdrew; and he again retired to his chamber in the deepest dejection. The next day, the sergeant-at-arms and the usher of the House of Lords came to conduct him to Westminster Hall, where sentence was to be pronounced. But they found him so unwell that he could not leave his bed; and this excuse for his absence was readily accepted. In no quarter does there appear to have been the smallest desire to add to his humiliation. The sentence was, however, severe--the more severe, no doubt, because the Lords knew that it would not be executed, and that they had an excellent opportunity of exhibiting, at small cost, the inflexibility of their justice, and their abhorrence of corruption. Bacon was condemned to pay a fine of forty thousand pounds, and to be imprisoned in the Tower during the King's pleasure. He was declared incapable of holding any office in the State or of sitting in Parliament: and he was banished for life from the verge of the court. In such misery and shame ended that long career of worldly wisdom and worldly prosperity. Even at this pass Mr. Montagu does not desert his hero. He seems indeed to think that the attachment of an editor ought to be as devoted as that of Mr. Moore's lovers; and cannot conceive what biography was made for,                                    "if 'tis not the same Through joy and through torment, through glory and shame." He assures us that Bacon was innocent, that he had the means of making a perfectly satisfactory defence, that when "he plainly and ingenuously confessed that he was guilty of corruption," and when he afterwards solemnly affirmed that his confession was "his act, his hand, his heart," he was telling a great lie, and that he refrained from bringing forward proofs of his innocence, because he durst not disobey the King and the favourite, who, for their own selfish objects, pressed him to plead guilty. Now, in the first place, there is not the smallest reason to believe that, if James and Buckingham had thought that Bacon had a good defence, they would have prevented him from making it. What conceivable motive had they for doing so? Mr. Montagu perpetually repeats that it was their interest to sacrifice Bacon. But he overlooks an obvious distinction. It was their interest to sacrifice Bacon on the supposition of his guilt; but not on the supposition of his innocence. James was very properly unwilling to run the risk of protecting his Chancellor against the Parliament. But if the Chancellor had been able, by force of argument, to obtain an acquittal from the Parliament, we have no doubt that both the King and Villiers would have heartily rejoiced. They would have rejoiced, not merely on account of their friendship for Bacon, which seems, however, to have been as sincere as most friendships of that sort, but on selfish grounds. Nothing could have strengthened the Government more than such a victory. The King and the favourite abandoned the Chancellor because they were unable to avert his disgrace, and unwilling to share it. Mr. Montagu mistakes effect for cause. He thinks that Bacon did not prove his innocence, because he was not supported by the Court. The truth evidently is that the Court did not venture to support Bacon, because he could not prove his innocence. Again, it seems strange that Mr. Montagu should not perceive that, while attempting to vindicate Bacon's reputation, he is really casting on it the foulest of all aspersions. He imputes to his idol a degree of meanness and depravity more loathsome than judicial corruption itself. A corrupt judge may have many good qualities. But a man who, to please a powerful patron, solemnly declares himself guilty of corruption when he knows himself to be innocent, must be a monster of servility and impudence. Bacon was, to say nothing of his highest claims to respect, a gentleman, a nobleman, a scholar, a statesman, a man of the first consideration in society, a man far advanced in years. Is it possible to believe that such a man would, to gratify any human being, irreparably ruin his own character by his own act? Imagine a grey-headed judge, full of years and honours, owning with tears, with pathetic assurances of his penitence and of his sincerity, that he has been guilty of shameful malpractices, repeatedly asseverating the truth of his confession, subscribing it with his own hand, submitting to conviction, receiving a humiliating sentence and acknowledging its justice, and all this when he has it in his power to show that his conduct has been irreproachable! The thing is incredible. But if we admit it to be true, what must we think of such a man, if indeed he deserves the name of man, who thinks anything that kings and minions can bestow more precious than honour, or anything that they can inflict more terrible than infamy? Of this most disgraceful imputation we fully acquit Bacon. He had no defence; and Mr. Montagu's affectionate attempt to make a defence for him has altogether failed. The grounds on which Mr. Montagu rests the case are two: the first, that the taking of presents was usual, and, what he seems to consider as the same thing, not discreditable; the second, that these presents were not taken as bribes. Mr Montagu brings forward many facts in support of his first proposition. He is not content with showing that many English judges formerly received gifts from suitors, but collects similar instances from foreign nations and ancient times. He goes back to the commonwealths of Greece, and attempts to press into his service a line of Homer and a sentence of Plutarch, which, we fear, will hardly serve his turn. The gold of which Homer speaks was not intended to fee the judges, but was paid into court for the benefit of the successful litigant; and the gratuities which Pericles, as Plutarch states, distributed among the members of the Athenian tribunals, were legal wages paid out of the public revenue. We can supply Mr. Montagu with passages much more in point. Hesiod, who, like poor Aubrey, had a "killing decree " made against him in the Chancery of Ascra, forgot decorum so far that he ventured to designate the learned persons who presided in that court, as Basileas dorophagous. Plutarch and Diodorus have handed down to the latest ages the respectable name of Anytus, the son of Anthemion, the first defendant who, eluding all the safeguards which the ingenuity of Solon could devise, succeeded in corrupting a bench of Athenian judges. We are indeed so far from grudging Mr. Montagu the aid of Greece, that we will give him Rome into the bargain. We acknowledge that the honourable senators who tried Verres received presents which were worth more than the fee-simple of York House and Gorhambury together, and that the no less honourable senators and knights who professed to believe in the alibi of Clodius obtained marks still more extraordinary of the esteem and gratitude of the defendant. In short, we are ready to admit that, before Bacon's time, and in Bacon's time, judges were in the habit of receiving gifts from suitors. But is this a defence? We think not. The robberies of Cacus and Barabbas are no apology for those of Turpin. The conduct of the two men of Belial who swore away the life of Naboth has never been cited as an excuse for the perjuries of Oates and Dangerfield. Mr. Montagu has confounded two things which it is necessary carefully to distinguish from each other, if we wish to form a correct judgment of the characters of men of other countries and other times. That an immoral action is in a particular society, generally considered as innocent, is a good plea for an individual who, being one of that society, and having adopted the notions which prevail among his neighbours, commits that action. But the circumstance that a great many people are in the habit of committing immoral actions is no plea at all. We should think it unjust to call St. Louis a wicked man, because in an age in which toleration was generally regarded as a sin, he persecuted heretics. We should think it unjust to call Cowper's friend, John Newton, a hypocrite and monster, because at a time when the slave-trade was commonly considered by the most respectable people as an innocent and beneficial traffic, he went, largely provided with hymn-books and handcuffs, on a Guinea voyage. But the circumstance that there are twenty thousand thieves in London is no excuse for a fellow who is caught breaking into a shop. No man is to be blamed for not making discoveries in morality, for not finding out that something which everybody else thinks to be good is really bad. But, if a man does that which he and all around him know to be bad, it is no excuse for him that many others have done the same. We should be ashamed of spending so much time in pointing out so clear a distinction, but that Mr. Montagu seems altogether to overlook it. Now, to apply these principles to the case before us; let Mr. Montagu prove that, in Bacon's age, the practices for which Bacon was punished were generally considered as innocent, and we admit that he has made out his point. But this we defy him to do. That these practices were common we admit; but they were common just as all wickedness to which there is strong temptation always was and always will be common. They were common just as theft, cheating, perjury, adultery have always been common. They were common, not because people did not know what was right, but because people liked to do what was wrong. They were common, though prohibited by law. They were common, though condemned by public opinion. They were common, because in that age law and public opinion united had not sufficient force to restrain the greediness of powerful and unprincipled magistrates. They were common, as every crime will be common when the gain to which it leads is great, and the chance of punishment small. But, though common, they were universally allowed to be altogether unjustifiable; they were in the highest degree odious; and, though many were guilty of them, none had the audacity publicly to avow and defend them. We could give a thousand proofs that the opinion then entertained concerning these practices was such as we have described. But we will content ourselves with calling a single witness, honest Hugh Latimer. His sermons, preached more than seventy years before the inquiry into Bacon's conduct, abound with the sharpest invectives against those very practices of which Bacon was guilty, and which, as Mr. Montagu seems to think, nobody ever considered as blamable till Bacon was punished for them. We could easily fill twenty pages with the homely, but just and forcible rhetoric of the brave old bishop. We shall select a few passages as fair specimens, and no more than fair specimens, of the rest. "Omnes diligunt munera. They all love bribes. Bribery is a princely kind of thieving. They will be waged by the rich, either to give sentence against the poor, or to put off the poor man's cause. This is the noble theft of princes and magistrates. They are bribe-takers. Nowadays they call them gentle rewards. Let them leave their colouring, and call them by their Christian name-- bribes." And again. "Cambyses was a great emperor, such another as our master is. He had many lord-deputies, lord-presidents, and lieutenants under him. It is a great while ago since I read the history. It chanced he had under him, in one of his dominions, a briber, a gift-taker, a gratifier of rich men; he followed gifts as fast as he that followed the pudding, a hand-maker in his office to make his son a great man, as the old saying is: Happy is the child whose father goeth to the devil. The cry of the poor widow came to the emperor's ear, and caused him to flay the judge quick, and laid his skin in the chair of judgment, that all judges that should give judgment afterwards should sit in the same skin. Surely it was a goodly sign, a goodly monument, the sign of the judge's skin. I pray God we may once see the skin in England." "I am sure," says he, in another sermon, "this is scala inferni, the right way to hell, to be covetous, to take bribes, and pervert justice. If a judge should ask me the way to hell, I would show him this way. First, let him be a covetous man; let his heart be poisoned with covetousness. Then let him go a little further, and take bribes; and, lastly, pervert judgment. Lo, here is the mother, and the daughter, and the daughter's daughter. Avarice is the mother: she brings forth bribe-taking, and bribe- taking perverting of judgment. There lacks a fourth thing to make up the mess, which, so help me God, if I were judge, should be hangum tuum, a Tyburn tippet to take with him; an it were the judge of the King's Bench, my Lord Chief Judge of England, yea, an it were my Lord Chancellor himself, to Tyburn with him." We will quote but one more passage. "He that took the silver basin and ewer for a bribe, thinketh that it will never come out. But he may now know that I know it, and I know it not alone; there be more beside me that know it. Oh, briber and bribery! He was never a good man that will so take bribes. Nor can I believe that he that is a briber will be a good justice. It will never be merry in England till we have the skins of such. For what needeth bribing where men do their things uprightly?" This was not the language of a great philosopher who had made new discoveries in moral and political science. It was the plain talk of a plain man, who sprang from the body of the people, who sympathised strongly with their wants and their feelings, and who boldly uttered their opinions. It was on account of the fearless way in which stout-hearted old Hugh exposed the misdeeds of men in ermine tippets and gold collars, that the Londoners cheered him, as he walked down the Strand to preach at Whitehall, struggled for a touch of his gown, and bawled, "Have at them, Father Latimer!" It is plain, from the passages which we have quoted, and from fifty others which we might quote, that, long before Bacon was born, the accepting of presents by a judge was known to be a wicked and shameful act, that the fine words under which it was the fashion to veil such corrupt practices were even then seen through by the common people, that the distinction on which Mr. Montagu insists between compliments and bribes was even then laughed at as a mere colouring. There may be some oratorical exaggeration in what Latimer says about the Tyburn tippet and the sign of the judge's skin; but the fact that he ventured to use such expressions is amply sufficient to prove that the gift- taking judges, the receivers of silver basins and ewers, were regarded as such pests of the commonwealth that a venerable divine might, without any breach of Christian charity, publicly pray to God for their detection and their condign punishment. Mr. Montagu tells us, most justly, that we ought not to transfer the opinions of our age to a former age. But he has himself committed a greater error than that against which he has cautioned his readers. Without any evidence, nay, in the face of the strongest evidence, he ascribes to the people of a former age a set of opinions which no people ever held. But any hypothesis is in his view more probable than that Bacon should have been a dishonest man. We firmly believe that, if papers were to be discovered which should irresistibly prove that Bacon was concerned in the poisoning of Sir Thomas Overbury, Mr. Montagu would tell us that, at the beginning of the seventeenth century, it was not thought improper in a man to put arsenic into the broth of his friends, and that we ought to blame, not Bacon, but the age in which he lived. But why should we have recourse to any other evidence, when the proceeding against Lord Bacon is itself the best evidence on the subject? When Mr. Montagu tells us that we ought not to transfer the opinions of our age to Bacon's age, he appears altogether to forget that it was by men of Bacon's own age, that Bacon was prosecuted, tried, convicted, and sentenced. Did not they know what their own opinions were? Did not they know whether they thought the taking of gifts by a judge a crime or not? Mr. Montagu complains bitterly that Bacon was induced to abstain from making a defence. But, if Bacon's defence resembled that which is made for him in the volume before us, it would have been unnecessary to trouble the Houses with it. The Lords and Commons did not want Bacon to tell them the thoughts of their own hearts, to inform them that they did not consider such practices as those in which they had detected him as at all culpable. Mr. Montagu's proposition may indeed be fairly stated thus:--It was very hard that Bacon's contemporaries should think it wrong in him to do what they did not think it wrong in him to do. Hard indeed; and withal somewhat improbable. Will any person say that the Commons who impeached Bacon for taking presents, and the Lords who sentenced him to fine, imprisonment, and degradation for taking presents, did not know that the taking of presents was a crime? Or, will any person say that Bacon did not know what the whole House of Commons and the whole House of Lords knew? Nobody who is not prepared to maintain one of these absurd propositions can deny that Bacon committed what he knew to be a crime. It cannot be pretended that the Houses were seeking occasion to ruin Bacon, and that they therefore brought him to punishment on charges which they themselves knew to be frivolous. In no quarter was there the faintest indication of a disposition to treat him harshly. Through the whole proceeding there was no symptom of personal animosity or of factious violence in either House. Indeed, we will venture to say that no State-Trial in our History is more creditable to all who took part in it, either as prosecutors or judges. The decency, the gravity, the public spirit, the justice moderated but not unnerved by compassion, which appeared in every part of the transaction, would do honour to the most respectable public men of our own times. The accusers, while they discharged their duty to their constituents by bringing the misdeeds of the Chancellor to light, spoke with admiration of his many eminent qualities. The Lords, while condemning him, complimented him on the ingenuousness of his confession, and spared him the humiliation of a public appearance at their bar. So strong was the contagion of good feeling that even Sir Edward Coke, for the first time in his life, behaved like a gentleman. No criminal ever had more temperate prosecutors than Bacon. No criminal ever had more favourable judges. If he was convicted, it was because it was impossible to acquit him without offering the grossest outrage to justice and common sense. Mr. Montagu's other argument, namely, that Bacon, though he took gifts, did not take bribes, seems to us as futile as that which we have considered. Indeed, we might be content to leave it to be answered by the plainest man among our readers. Demosthenes noticed it with contempt more than two thousand years ago. Latimer, we have seen, treated this sophistry with similar disdain. "Leave colouring," said he, "and call these things by their Christian name, bribes." Mr. Montagu attempts, somewhat unfairly, we must say, to represent the presents which Bacon received as similar to the perquisites which suitors paid to the members of the Parliaments of France. The French magistrate had a legal right to his fee; and the amount of the fee was regulated by law. Whether this be a good mode of remunerating judges is not the question. But what analogy is there between payments of this sort, and the presents which Bacon received, presents which were not sanctioned by the law, which were not made under the public eye, and of which the amount was regulated only by private bargain between the magistrate and the suitor? Again, it is mere trifling to say that Bacon could not have meant to act corruptly, because he employed the agency of men of rank, of bishops, privy councillors, and members of Parliament; as if the whole history of that generation was not full of the low actions of high people; as if it was not notorious that men, as exalted in rank as any of the decoys that Bacon employed, had pimped for Somerset, and poisoned Overbury. But, says Mr. Montagu, these presents "were made openly and with the greatest publicity." This would indeed be a strong argument in favour of Bacon. But we deny the fact. In one, and one only, of the cases in which Bacon was accused of corruptly receiving gifts, does he appear to have received a gift publicly. This was in a matter depending between the Company of Apothecaries and the Company of Grocers. Bacon, in his Confession, insisted strongly on the circumstance that he had on this occasion taken a present publicly, as a proof that he had not taken it corruptly. Is it not clear that, if he had taken the presents mentioned in the other charges in the same public manner, he would have dwelt on this point in his answer to those charges? The fact that he insists so strongly on the publicity of one particular present is of itself sufficient to prove that the other presents were not publicly taken. Why he took this present publicly and the rest secretly, is evident. He on that occasion acted openly, because he was acting honestly. He was not on that occasion sitting judicially. He was called in to effect an amicable arrangement between two parties. Both were satisfied with his decision. Both joined in making him a present in return for his trouble. Whether it was quite delicate in a man of his rank to accept a present under such circumstances, may be questioned. But there is no ground in this case for accusing him of corruption. Unhappily, the very circumstances which prove him to have been innocent in this case prove him to have been guilty on the other charges. Once, and once only, he alleges that he received a present publicly. The natural inference is that in all the other cases mentioned in the articles against him he received presents secretly. When we examine the single case in which he alleges that he received a present publicly, we find that it is also the single case in which there was no gross impropriety in his receiving a present. Is it then possible to doubt that his reason for not receiving other presents in as public a manner was that he knew that it was wrong to receive them? One argument still remains, plausible in appearance, but admitting of easy and complete refutation. The two chief complainants, Aubrey and Egerton, had both made presents to the Chancellor. But he had decided against them both. Therefore, he had not received those presents as bribes. "The complaints of his accusers were," says Mr. Montagu, "not that the gratuities had, but that they had not influenced Bacon's judgment, as he had decided against them." The truth is, that it is precisely in this way that an extensive system of corruption is generally detected. A person who, by a bribe, has procured a decree in his favour, is by no means likely to come forward of his own accord as an accuser. He is content. He has his quid pro quo. He is not impelled either by interested or by vindictive motives to bring the transaction before the public. On the contrary, he has almost as strong motives for holding his tongue as the judge himself can have. But when a judge practises corruption, as we fear that Bacon practised it, on a large scale, and has many agents looking out in different quarters for prey, it will sometimes happen that he will be bribed on both sides. It will sometimes happen that he will receive money from suitors who are so obviously in the wrong that he cannot with decency do anything to serve them. Thus he will now and then be forced to pronounce against a person from whom he has received a present; and he makes that person a deadly enemy. The hundreds who have got what they paid for remain quiet. It is the two or three who have paid, and have nothing to show for their money, who are noisy. The memorable case of the Goezmans is an example of this. Beaumarchais had an important suit depending before the Parliament of Paris. M. Goezman was the judge on whom chiefly the decision depended. It was hinted to Beaumarchais that Madame Goezman might be propitiated by a present. He accordingly offered a purse of gold to the lady, who received it graciously. There can be no doubt that, if the decision of the court had been favourable to him, these things would never have been known to the world. But he lost his cause. Almost the whole sum which he had expended in bribery was immediately refunded; and those who had disappointed him probably thought that he would not, for the mere gratification of his malevolence, make public a transaction which was discreditable to himself as well as to them. They knew little of him. He soon taught them to curse the day in which they had dared to trifle with a man of so revengeful and turbulent a spirit, of such dauntless effrontery, and of such eminent talents for controversy and satire. He compelled the Parliament to put a degrading stigma on M. Goezman. He drove Madame Goezman to a convent. Till it was too late to pause, his excited passions did not suffer him to remember that he could effect their ruin only by disclosures ruinous to himself. We could give other instances. But it is needless. No person well acquainted with human nature can fail to perceive that, if the doctrine for which Mr. Montagu contends were admitted, society would be deprived of almost the only chance which it has of detecting the corrupt practices of judges. We return to our narrative. The sentence of Bacon had scarcely been pronounced when it was mitigated. He was indeed sent to the Tower. But this was merely a form. In two days he was set at liberty, and soon after he retired to Gorhambury. His fine was speedily released by the Crown. He was next suffered to present himself at Court; and at length, in 1624, the rest of his punishment was remitted. He was now at liberty to resume his seat in the House of Lords, and he was actually summoned to the next Parliament. But age, infirmity, and perhaps shame, prevented him from attending. The Government allowed him a pension of twelve hundred pounds a year; and his whole annual income is estimated by Mr. Montagu at two thousand five hundred pounds, a sum which. was probably above the average income of a nobleman of that generation, and which was certainly sufficient for comfort and even for splendour. Unhappily, Bacon was fond of display, and unused to pay minute attention to domestic affairs. He was not easily persuaded to give up any part of the magnificence to which he had been accustomed in the time of his power and prosperity. No pressure of distress could induce him to part with the woods of Gorhambury. "I will not," he said, "be stripped of my feathers." He travelled with so splendid an equipage and so large a retinue that Prince Charles, who once fell in with him on the road, exclaimed with surprise, "Well; do what we can, this man scorns to go out in snuff." This carelessness and ostentation reduced Bacon to frequent distress. He was under the necessity of parting with York House, and of taking up his residence, during his visits to London, at his old chambers in Gray's Inn. He had other vexations, the exact nature of which is unknown. It is evident from his will that some part of his wife's conduct had greatly disturbed and irritated him. But, whatever might be his pecuniary difficulties or his conjugal discomforts, the powers of his intellect still remained undiminished. Those noble studies for which he had found leisure in the midst of professional drudgery and of courtly intrigues gave to this last sad stage of his life a dignity beyond what power or titles could bestow. Impeached, convicted, sentenced, driven with ignominy from the presence of his Sovereign, shut out from the deliberations of his fellow nobles, loaded with debt, branded with dishonour, sinking under the weight of years, sorrows, and diseases, Bacon was Bacon still. "My conceit of his person," says Ben Jonson very finely, "was never increased towards him by his place or honours; but I have and do reverence him for the greatness that was only proper to himself; in that he seemed to me ever, by his work, one of the greatest men and most worthy of admiration, that had been in many ages. In his adversity I ever prayed that God would give him strength; for greatness he could not want." The services which Bacon rendered to letters during the last five years of his life, amidst ten thousand distractions and vexations, increase the regret with which we think on the many years which he had wasted, to use the words of Sir Thomas Bodley, "on such study as was not worthy of such a student." He commenced a Digest of the Laws of England, a History of England under the Princes of the House of Tudor, a body of Natural History, a Philosophical Romance. He made extensive and valuable additions to his Essays. He published the inestimable Treatise De Augmentis Scientiarum. The very trifles with which he amused himself in hours of pain and languor bore the mark of his mind. The best collection of jests in the world is that which he dictated from memory, without referring to any book, on a day on which illness had rendered him incapable of serious study. The great apostle of experimental philosophy was destined to be its martyr. It had occurred to him that snow might be used with advantage for the purpose of preventing animal substances from putrefying. On a very cold day, early in the spring of the year 1626, he alighted from his coach near Highgate, in order to try the experiment. He went into a cottage, bought a fowl, and with his own hands stuffed it with snow. While thus engaged he felt a sudden chill, and was soon so much indisposed that it was impossible for him to return to Gray's Inn. The Earl of Arundel, with whom he was well acquainted, had a house at Highgate. To that house Bacon was carried. The Earl was absent; but the servants who were in charge of the place showed great respect and attention to the illustrious guest. Here, after an illness of about a week, he expired early on the morning of Easter-day, 1626. His mind appears to have retained its strength and liveliness to the end. He did not forget the fowl which had caused his death. In the last letter that he ever wrote, with fingers which, as he said, could not steadily hold a pen, he did not omit to mention that the experiment of the snow had succeeded "excellently well." Our opinion of the moral character of this great man has already been sufficiently explained. Had his life been passed in literary retirement, he would, in all probability, have deserved to be considered, not only as a great philosopher, but as a worthy and good-natured member of society. But neither his principles nor his spirit were such as could be trusted, when strong temptations were to be resisted, and serious dangers to be braved. In his will he expressed with singular brevity, energy, dignity, and pathos, a mournful consciousness that his actions had not been such as to entitle him to the esteem of those under whose observation his life had been passed, and, at the same time, a proud confidence that his writings had secured for him a high and permanent place among the benefactors of mankind. So at least we understand those striking words which have been often quoted, but which we must quote once more. "For my name and memory, I leave it to men's charitable speeches, and to foreign nations, and to the next age." His confidence was just. From the day of his death his fame has been constantly and steadily progressive; and we have no doubt that his name will be named with reverence to the latest ages, and to the remotest ends of the civilised world. The chief peculiarity of Bacon's philosophy seems to us to have been this, that it aimed at things altogether different from those which his predecessors had proposed to themselves. This was his own opinion. " Finis scientiarum," says he, "a nemine adhuc bene positus est."[Novum Organum, Lib. i. Aph. 81.] And again, "Omnium gravissimus error in deviatione ab ultimo doctrinarum fine consistit." [De Augmentis, Lib. i.] " Nec ipsa meta," says he elsewhere, "adhuc ulli, quod sciam, mortalium posita est et defixa."[Cogitata et visa.] The more carefully his works are examined, the more clearly, we think, it will appear that this is the real clue to his whole system, and that he used means different from those used by other philosophers, because he wished to arrive at an end altogether different from theirs. What then was the end which Bacon proposed to himself? It was, to use his own emphatic expression, "fruit." It was the multiplying of human enjoyments and the mitigating of human sufferings. It was "the relief of man's estate." [Advancement of Learning, Book i.] It was "commodis humanis inservire." [De Augmentis, Lib. vii. Cap. i.] It was "efficaciter operari ad sublevanda vitae humanae incommoda." [Ib., Lib. ii. Cap. ii.] It was "dotare vitam humanam novis inventis et copiis." [Novum Organum, Lib. i., Aph. 81.] It was "genus humanum novis operibus et potestatibus continuo dotare." [Cogitata et visa.] This was the object of all his speculations in every department of science, in natural philosophy, in legislation, in politics, in morals. Two words form the key of the Baconian doctrine, Utility and Progress. The ancient philosophy disdained to be useful, and was content to be stationary. It dealt largely in theories of moral perfection, which were so sublime that they never could be more than theories; in attempts to solve insoluble enigmas; in exhortations to the attainment of unattainable frames of mind. It could not condescend to the humble office of ministering to the comfort of human beings. All the schools contemned that office as degrading; some censured it as immoral. Once indeed Posidonius, a distinguished writer of the age of Cicero and Caesar, so far forgot himself as to enumerate, among the humbler blessings which mankind owed to philosophy, the discovery of the principle of the arch, and the introduction of the use of metals. This eulogy was considered as an affront, and was taken up with proper spirit. Seneca vehemently disclaims these insulting compliments. [Seneca, Epist. 90.] Philosophy, according to him, has nothing to do with teaching men to rear arched roofs over their heads. The true philosopher does not care whether he has an arched roof or any roof, Philosophy has nothing to do with teaching men the uses of metals. She teaches us to be independent of all material substances, of all mechanical contrivances. The wise man lives according to nature. Instead of attempting to add to the physical comforts of his species, he regrets that his lot was not cast in that golden age when the human race had no protection against the cold but the skins of wild beasts, no screen from the sun but a cavern. To impute to such a man any share in the invention or improvement of a plough, a ship, or a mill is an insult. "In my own time," says Seneca, "there have been inventions of this sort, transparent windows, tubes for diffusing warmth equally through all parts of a building, shorthand, which has been carried to such a perfection that a writer can keep pace with the most rapid speaker. But the inventing of such things is drudgery for the lowest slaves; philosophy lies deeper. It is not her office to teach men how to use their hands. The object of her lessons is to form the soul. Non est, inquam, instrumentorum ad usus necessarios opifex." If the non were left out, this last sentence would be no bad description of the Baconian philosophy, and would, indeed, very much resemble several expressions in the Novum Organum. "We shall next be told," exclaims Seneca, "that the first shoemaker was a philosopher." For our own part, if we are forced to make our choice between the first shoemaker and the author of the three books "On Anger," we pronounce for the shoemaker. It may be worse to be angry than to be wet. But shoes have kept millions from being wet; and we doubt whether Seneca ever kept anybody from being angry. It is very reluctantly that Seneca can be brought to confess that any philosopher had ever paid the smallest attention to anything that could possibly promote what vulgar people would consider as the well-being of mankind. He labours to clear Democritus from the disgraceful imputation of having made the first arch, and Anacharsis from the charge of having contrived the potter's wheel. He is forced to own that such a thing might happen; and it may also happen, he tells us, that a philosopher may be swift of foot. But it is not in his character of philosopher that he either wins a race or invents a machine. No, to be sure. The business of a philosopher was to declaim in praise of poverty with two millions sterling out at usury, to meditate epigrammatic conceits about the evils of luxury, in gardens which moved the envy of sovereigns, to rant about liberty, while fawning on the insolent and pampered freedmen of a tyrant, to celebrate the divine beauty of virtue with the same pen which had just before written a defence of the murder of a mother by a son. From the cant of this philosophy, a philosophy meanly proud of its own unprofitableness, it is delightful to turn to the lessons of the great English teacher. We can almost forgive all the faults of Bacon's life when we read that singularly graceful and dignified passage: "Ego certe, ut de me ipso, quod res est, loquar, et in iis quae nunc edo, et in iis quae in posterum meditor, dignitatem ingenii et nominis mei, si qua sit, saepius sciens et volens projicio, dum commodis humanis inserviam; quique architectus fortasse in philosophia et scientiis esse debeam, etiam operarius, et bajulus, et quidvis demum fio, cum haud pauca quae omnino fieri necesse sit, alii autem ob innatum superbiam subterfugiant, ipsi sustineam et exsequar." [De Augmentis, Lib. vii. Cap. i.] This philanthropia, which, as he said in one of the most remarkable of his early letters, "was so fixed in his mind, as it could not be removed," this majestic humility, this persuasion that nothing can be too insignificant for the attention of the wisest, which is not too insignificant to give pleasure or pain to the meanest, is the great characteristic distinction, the essential spirit of the Baconian philosophy. We trace it in all that Bacon has written on Physics, on Laws, on Morals. And we conceive that from this peculiarity all the other peculiarities of his system directly and almost necessarily sprang. The spirit which appears in the passage of Seneca to which we have referred tainted the whole body of the ancient philosophy from the time of Socrates downwards, and took possession of intellects with which that of Seneca cannot for a moment be compared. It pervades the dialogues of Plato. It may be distinctly traced in many parts of the works of Aristotle. Bacon has dropped hints from which it may be inferred that, in his opinion, the prevalence of this feeling was in a great measure to be attributed to the influence of Socrates. Our great countryman evidently did not consider the revolution which Socrates effected in philosophy as a happy event, and constantly maintained that the earlier Greek speculators, Democritus in particular, were, on the whole, superior to their more celebrated successors. [Novum Organum, Lib. i. Aph. 71, 79. De Augmentis, Lib. iii. Cap. iv. De principiis, atque originibus. Cogitata et visa. Redargutio philosophiarum.] Assuredly if the tree which Socrates planted and Plato watered is to be judged of by its flowers and leaves, it is the noblest of trees. But if we take the homely test of Bacon, if we judge of the tree by its fruits, our opinion of it may perhaps be less favourable. When we sum up all the useful truths which we owe to that philosophy, to what do they amount? We find, indeed, abundant proofs that some of those who cultivated it were men of the first order of intellect. We find among their writings incomparable specimens both of dialectical and rhetorical art. We have no doubt that the ancient controversies were of use, in so far as they served to exercise the faculties of the disputants; for there is no controversy so idle that it may not be of use in this way. But, when we look for something more, for something which adds to the comforts or alleviates the calamities of the human race, we are forced to own ourselves disappointed. We are forced to say with Bacon that this celebrated philosophy ended in nothing but disputation, that it was neither a vineyard nor an olive-ground, but an intricate wood of briars and thistles, from which those who lost themselves in it brought back many scratches and no food. [Novum Organum, Lib. i. Aph. 73.] We readily acknowledge that some of the teachers of this unfruitful wisdom were among the greatest men that the world has ever seen. If we admit the justice of Bacon's censure, we admit it with regret, similar to that which Dante felt when he learned the fate of those illustrious heathens who were doomed to the first circle of Hell: "Gran duol mi prese al cuor quando lo 'ntesi, Perocche gente di molto valore Conobbi che 'n quel limbo eran sospesi." But in truth the very admiration which we feel for the eminent philosophers of antiquity forces us to adopt the opinion that their powers were systematically misdirected. For how else could it be that such powers should effect so little for mankind? A pedestrian may show as much muscular vigour on a treadmill as on the highway road. But on the road his vigour will assuredly carry him forward; and on the treadmill he will not advance an inch. The ancient philosophy was a treadmill, not a path. It was made up of revolving questions, of controversies which were always beginning again. It was a contrivance for having much exertion and no progress. We must acknowledge that more than once, while contemplating the doctrines of the Academy and the Portico, even as they appear in the transparent splendour of Cicero's incomparable diction, we have been tempted to mutter with the surly centurion in Persius, "Cur quis non prandeat hoc est?" What is the highest good, whether pain be an evil, whether all things be fated, whether we can be certain of anything, whether we can be certain that we are certain of nothing, whether a wise man can be unhappy, whether all departures from right be equally reprehensible; these, and other questions of the same sort, occupied the brains, the tongues, and the pens of the ablest men in the civilised world during several centuries. This sort of philosophy, it is evident, could not be progressive. It might indeed sharpen and invigorate the minds of those who devoted themselves to it; and so might the disputes of the orthodox Lilliputians and the heretical Blefuscudians about the big ends and the little ends of eggs. But such disputes could add nothing to the stock of knowledge. The human mind accordingly, instead of marching, merely marked time. It took as much trouble as would have sufficed to carry it forward; and yet remained on the same spot. There was no accumulation of truth, no heritage of truth acquired by the labour of one generation and bequeathed to another, to be again transmitted with large additions to a third. Where this philosophy was in the time of Cicero, there it continued to be in the time of Seneca, and there it continued to be in the time of Favorinus. The same sects were still battling with the same unsatisfactory arguments, about the same interminable questions. There had been no want of ingenuity, of zeal, of industry. Every trace of intellectual cultivation was there, except a harvest. There had been plenty of ploughing, harrowing, reaping, threshing. But the garners contained only smut and stubble. The ancient philosophers did not neglect natural science but they did not cultivate it for the purpose of increasing the power and ameliorating the condition of man. The taint of barrenness had spread from ethical to physical speculations. Seneca wrote largely on natural philosophy, and magnified the importance of that study. But why? Not because it tended to assuage suffering, to multiply the conveniences of life, to extend the empire of man over the material world; but solely because it tended to raise the mind above low cares, to separate it from the body, to exercise its subtilty in the solution of very obscure questions.[Seneca, Nat. Quaest. praef. Lib. iii.] Thus natural philosophy was considered in the light merely of a mental exercise. It was made subsidiary to the art of disputation; and it consequently proved altogether barren of useful discoveries. There was one sect which, however absurd and pernicious some of its doctrines may have been, ought, it should seem, to have merited an exception from the general censure which Bacon has pronounced on the ancient schools of wisdom. The Epicurean, who referred all happiness to bodily pleasure, and all evil to bodily pain, might have been expected to exert himself for the purpose of bettering his own physical condition and that of his neighbours. But the thought seems never to have occurred to any member of that school. Indeed their notion, as reported by their great poet, was, that no more improvements were to be expected in the arts which conduce to the comfort of life.         "Ad victum quae flagitat usus Omnia jam ferme mortalibus esse parata." This contented despondency, this disposition to admire what has been done, and to expect that nothing more will be done, is strongly characteristic of all the schools which preceded the school of Fruit and Progress. Widely as the Epicurean and the Stoic differed on most points, they seem to have quite agreed in their contempt for pursuits so vulgar as to be useful. The philosophy of both was a garrulous, declaiming, canting, wrangling philosophy. Century after century they continued to repeat their hostile war-cries, Virtue and Pleasure; and in the end it appeared that the Epicurean had added as little to the quantity of pleasure as the Stoic to the quantity of virtue. It is on the pedestal of Bacon, not on that of Epicurus, that those noble lines ought to be inscribed "0 tenebris tantis tam clarum extollere lumen Qui primus potuisti, illustrans commoda vitae." In the fifth century Christianity had conquered Paganism, and Paganism had infected Christianity. The Church was now victorious and corrupt. The rites of the Pantheon had passed into her worship, the subtilties of the Academy into her creed. In an evil day, though with great pomp and solemnity,--we quote the language of Bacon,--was the ill-starred alliance stricken between the old philosophy and the new faith. [Cogitata et visa.] Questions widely different from those which had employed the ingenuity of Pyrrho and Carneades, but just as subtle, just as interminable, and just as unprofitable, exercised the minds of the lively and voluble Greeks. When learning began to revive in the West, similar trifles occupied the sharp and vigorous intellects of the Schoolmen. There was another sowing of the wind, and another reaping of the whirlwind. The great work of improving the condition of the human race was still considered as unworthy of a man of learning. Those who undertook that task, if what they effected could be readily comprehended, were despised as mechanics; if not, they were in danger of being burned as conjurers. There cannot be a stronger proof of the degree in which the human mind had been misdirected than the history of the two greatest events which took place during the middle ages. We speak of the invention of Gunpowder and of the invention of Printing. The dates of both are unknown. The authors of both are unknown. Nor was this because men were too rude and ignorant to value intellectual superiority. The inventor of gunpowder appears to have been contemporary with Petrarch and Boccaccio. The inventor of printing was certainly contemporary with Nicholas the Fifth, with Cosmo de' Medici, and with a crowd of distinguished scholars. But the human mind still retained that fatal bent which it had received two thousand years earlier. George of Trebisond and Marsilio Ficino would not easily have been brought to believe that the inventor of the printing-press had done more for mankind than themselves, or than those ancient writers of whom they were the enthusiastic votaries. At length the time arrived when the barren philosophy which had, during so many ages, employed the faculties of the ablest of men, was destined to fall. It had worn many shapes. It had mingled itself with many creeds. It had survived revolutions in which empires, religions, languages, races, had perished. Driven from its ancient haunts, it had taken sanctuary in that Church which it had persecuted, and had, like the daring fiends of the poet, placed its seat                        "next the seat of God, And with its darkness dared affront his light." Words, and more words, and nothing but words, had been all the fruit of all the toil of all the most renowned sages of sixty generations. But the days of this sterile exuberance were numbered. Many causes predisposed the public mind to a change. The study of a great variety of ancient writers, though it did not give a right direction to philosophical research, did much towards destroying that blind reverence for authority which had prevailed when Aristotle ruled alone. The rise of the Florentine sect of Platonists, a sect to which belonged some of the finest minds of the fifteenth century, was not an unimportant event. The mere substitution of the Academic for the Peripatetic philosophy would indeed have done little good. But anything was better than the old habit of unreasoning servility. It was something to have a choice of tyrants. "A spark of freedom," as Gibbon has justly remarked, "was produced by this collision of adverse servitude." Other causes might be mentioned. But it is chiefly to the great reformation of religion that we owe the great reformation of philosophy. The alliance between the Schools and the Vatican had for ages been so close that those who threw off the dominion of the Vatican could not continue to recognise the authority of the Schools. Most of the chiefs of the schism treated the Peripatetic philosophy with contempt, and spoke of Aristotle as if Aristotle had been answerable for all the dogmas of Thomas Aquinas. "Nullo apud Lutheranos philosophiam esse in pretio," was a reproach which the defenders of the Church of Rome loudly repeated, and which many of the Protestant leaders considered as a compliment. Scarcely any text was more frequently cited by the reformers than that in which St. Paul cautions the Colossians not to let any man spoil them by philosophy. Luther, almost at the outset of his career, went so far as to declare that no man could be at once a proficient in the school of Aristotle and in that of Christ. Zwingle, Bucer, Peter Martyr, Calvin, held similar language. In some of the Scotch universities, the Aristotelian system was discarded for that of Ramus. Thus, before the birth of Bacon, the empire of the scholastic philosophy had been shaken to its foundations. There was in the intellectual world an anarchy resembling that which in the political world often follows the overthrow of an old and deeply rooted Government. Antiquity, prescription, the sound of great names, have ceased to awe mankind. The dynasty which had reigned for ages was at an end; and the vacant throne was left to be struggled for by pretenders. The first effect of this great revolution was, as Bacon most justly observed, [De Augmentis, Lib. i.] to give for a time an undue importance to the mere graces of style. The new breed of scholars, the Aschams and Buchanans, nourished with the finest compositions of the Augustan age, regarded with loathing the dry, crabbed, and barbarous diction of respondents and opponents. They were far less studious about the matter of their writing than about the manner. They succeeded in reforming Latinity; but they never even aspired to effect a reform in Philosophy. At this time Bacon appeared. It is altogether incorrect to say, as has often been said, that he was the first man who rose up against the Aristotelian philosophy when in the height of his power. The authority of that philosophy had, as we have shown, received a fatal blow long before he was born. Several speculators, among whom Ramus is the best known, had recently attempted to form new sects. Bacon's own expressions about the state of public opinion in the time of Luther are clear and strong: "Accedebat," says he, "odium et contemptus, illis ipsis temporibus ortus erga Scholasticos." And again, "Scholasticorum doctrina despectui prorsus haberi coepit tanquam aspera et barbara." [Both these passages are in the first book of the De Augmentis.] The part which Bacon played in this great change was the part, not of Robespierre, but of Bonaparte. The ancient order of things had been subverted. Some bigots still cherished with devoted loyalty the remembrance of the fallen monarchy, and exerted themselves to effect a restoration. But the majority had no such feeling. Freed, yet not knowing how to use their freedom, they pursued no determinate course, and had found no leader capable of conducting them. That leader at length arose. The philosophy which he taught was essentially new. It differed from that of the celebrated ancient teachers, not merely in method, but also in object. Its object was the good of mankind, in the sense in which the mass of mankind always have understood and always will understand the word good. "Meditor," said Bacon, "instaurationem philosophiae ejusmodi quae nihil inanis aut abstracti habeat, quaeque vitae humanae conditiones in melius provehat." [Redargutio Philosophiarum.] The difference between the philosophy of Bacon and that of his predecessors cannot, we think, be better illustrated than by comparing his views on some important subjects with those of Plato. We select Plato, because we conceive that he did more than any other person towards giving to the minds of speculative men that bent which they retained till they received from Bacon a new impulse in a diametrically opposite direction. It is curious to observe how differently these great men estimated the value of every kind of knowledge. Take Arithmetic for example. Plato, after speaking slightly of the convenience of being able to reckon and compute in the ordinary transactions of life, passes to what he considers as a far more important advantage. The study of the properties of numbers, he tells us, habituates the mind to the contemplation of pure truth, and raises us above the material universe. He would have his disciples apply themselves to this study, not that they may be able to buy or sell, not that they may qualify themselves to be shopkeepers or travelling merchants, but that they may learn to withdraw their minds from the ever-shifting spectacle of this visible and tangible world, and to fix them on the immutable essences of things. [Plato's Republic, Book vii.] Bacon, on the other hand, valued this branch of knowledge, only on account of its uses with reference to that visible and tangible world which Plato so much despised. He speaks with scorn of the mystical arithmetic of the later Platonists, and laments the propensity of mankind to employ, on mere matters of curiosity, powers the whole exertion of which is required for purposes of solid advantage. He advises arithmeticians to leave these trifles, and to employ themselves in framing convenient expressions, which may be of use in physical researches. [De Augmentis, Lib. iii. Cap. 6.] The same reasons which led Plato to recommend the study of arithmetic led him to recommend also the study of mathematics. The vulgar crowd of geometricians, he says, will not understand him. They have practice always in view. They do not know that the real use of the science is to lead men to the knowledge of abstract, essential, eternal truth. [Plato's Republic, Book vii.] Indeed, if we are to believe Plutarch, Plato carried this feeling so far that he considered geometry as degraded by being applied to any purpose of vulgar utility. Archytas, it seems, had framed machines of extraordinary power on mathematical principles. [Plutarch, Sympos. viii. and Life of Marcellus. The machines of Archytas are also mentioned by Aulus Gellius and Diogenes Laertius.] Plato remonstrated with his friend, and declared that this was to degrade a noble intellectual exercise into a low craft, fit only for carpenters and wheelwrights. The office of geometry, he said, was to discipline the mind, not to minister to the base wants of the body. His interference was successful; and from that time, according to Plutarch, the science of mechanics was considered as unworthy of the attention of a philosopher. Archimedes in a later age imitated and surpassed Archytas. But even Archimedes was not free from the prevailing notion that geometry was degraded by being employed to produce anything useful. It was with difficulty that he was induced to stoop from speculation to practice. He was half ashamed of those inventions which were the wonder of hostile nations, and always spoke of them slightingly as mere amusements, as trifles in which a mathematician might be suffered to relax his mind after intense application to the higher parts of his science. The opinion of Bacon on this subject was diametrically opposed to that of the ancient philosophers. He valued geometry chiefly, if not solely, on account of those uses, which to Plato appeared so base. And it is remarkable that the longer Bacon lived the stronger this feeling became. When in 1605 he wrote the two books on the Advancement of Learning, he dwelt on the advantages which mankind derived from mixed mathematics; but he at the same time admitted that the beneficial effect produced by mathematical study on the intellect, though a collateral advantage, was "no less worthy than that which was principal and intended." But it is evident that his views underwent a change. When, near twenty years later, he published the De Augmentis, which is the Treatise on the Advancement of Learning, greatly expanded and carefully corrected, he made important alterations in the part which related to mathematics. He condemned with severity the high, pretensions of the mathematicians, "delicias et fastum mathematicorum." Assuming the well-being of the human race to be the end of knowledge, [Usui et commodis hominum consulimus.] he pronounced that mathematical science could claim no higher rank than that of an appendage or auxiliary to other sciences. Mathematical science, he says, is the handmaid of natural philosophy; she ought to demean herself as such; and he declares that he cannot conceive by what ill chance it has happened that she presumes to claim precedence over her mistress. He predicts-- a prediction which would have made Plato shudder--that as more and more discoveries are made in physics, there will be more and more branches of mixed mathematics. Of that collateral advantage the value of which, twenty years before, he rated so highly, he says not one word. This omission cannot have been the effect of mere inadvertence. His own treatise was before him. From that treatise he deliberately expunged whatever was favourable to the study of pure mathematics, and inserted several keen reflections on the ardent votaries of that study. This fact, in our opinion, admits of only one explanation. Bacon's love of those pursuits which directly tend to improve the condition of mankind, and his jealousy of all pursuits merely curious, had grown upon him, and had, it may be, become immoderate. He was afraid of using any expression which might have the effect of inducing any man of talents to employ in speculations, useful only to the mind of the speculator, a single hour which might be employed in extending the empire of man over matter. [Compare the passage relating to mathematics in the Second Book of the Advancement of Learning with the De Augmentis Lib. iii. Cap. 6.] If Bacon erred here, we must acknowledge that we greatly prefer his error to the opposite error of Plato. We have no patience with a philosophy which, like those Roman matrons who swallowed abortives in order to preserve their shapes, takes pains to be barren for fear of being homely. Let us pass to astronomy. This was one of the sciences which Plato exhorted his disciples to learn, but for reasons far removed from common habits of thinking. "Shall we set down astronomy," says Socrates, "among the subjects of study?" [Plato's Republic, Book vii.] "I think so," answers his young friend Glaucon: "to know something about the seasons, the months, and the years is of use for military purposes, as well as for agriculture and navigation." "It amuses me," says Socrates, "to see how afraid you are, lest the common herd of people should accuse you of recommending useless studies." He then proceeds, in that pure and magnificent diction which, as Cicero said, Jupiter would use if Jupiter spoke Greek, to explain, that the use of astronomy is not to add to the vulgar comforts of life, but to assist in raising the mind to the contemplation of things which are to be perceived by the pure intellect alone. The knowledge of the actual motions of the heavenly bodies Socrates considers as of little value. The appearances which make the sky beautiful at night are, he tells us, like the figures which a geometrician draws on the sand, mere examples, mere helps to feeble minds. We must get beyond them; we must neglect them; we must attain to an astronomy which is as independent of the actual stars as geometrical truth is independent of the lines of an ill-drawn diagram. This is, we imagine, very nearly if not exactly, the astronomy which Bacon compared to the ox of Prometheus, [De Augmentis, Lib. iii. Cap. 4] a sleek, well-shaped hide, stuffed with rubbish, goodly to look at, but containing nothing to eat. He complained that astronomy had, to its great injury, been separated from natural philosophy, of which it was one of the noblest provinces, and annexed to the domain of mathematics. The world stood in need, he said, of a very different astronomy, of a living astronomy, [Astronomia viva.] of an astronomy which should set forth the nature, the motion, and the influences of the heavenly bodies, as they really are. [Quae substantiam et motum et influxum ecelestium, prout re vera sunt proponat." Compare this language with Plato's "ta d'en to ourano easomen."] On the greatest and most useful of all human inventions, the invention of alphabetical writing, Plato did not look with much complacency. He seems to have thought that the use of letters had operated on the human mind as the use of the go-cart in learning to walk, or of corks in learning to swim, is said to operate on the human body. It was a support which, in his opinion, soon became indispensable to those who used it, which made vigorous exertion first unnecessary and then impossible. The powers of the intellect would, he conceived, have been more fully developed without this delusive aid. Men would have been compelled to exercise the understanding and the memory, and, by deep and assiduous meditation, to make truth thoroughly their own. Now, on the contrary, much knowledge is traced on paper, but little is engraved in the soul. A man is certain that he can find information at a moment's notice when he wants it. He therefore suffers it to fade from his mind. Such a man cannot in strictness be said to know anything. He has the show without the reality of wisdom. These opinions Plato has put into the mouth of an ancient king of Egypt. [Plato's Phaedrus.] But it is evident from the context that they were his own; and so they were understood to be by Quinctilian. [Quinctilian, xi.] Indeed they are in perfect accordance with the whole Platonic system. Bacon's views, as may easily be supposed, were widely different. [De Augmentis, Lib. v. Cap. 5.] The powers of the memory, he observes, without the help of writing, can do little towards the advancement of any useful science. He acknowledges that the memory may be disciplined to such a point as to be able to perform very extraordinary feats. But on such feats he sets little value. The habits of his mind, he tells us, are such that he is not disposed to rate highly any accomplishment, however rare, which is of no practical use to mankind. As to these prodigious achievements of the memory, he ranks them with the exhibitions of rope-dancers and tumblers. "These two performances," he says, "are much of the same sort. The one is an abuse of the powers of the body; the other is an abuse of the powers of the mind. Both may perhaps excite our wonder; but neither is entitled to our respect." To Plato, the science of medicine appeared to be of very disputable advantages. [Plato's Republic, Book iii.] He did not indeed object to quick cures for acute disorders, or for injuries produced by accidents. But the art which resists the slow sap of a chronic disease, which repairs frames enervated by lust, swollen by gluttony, or inflamed by wine, which encourages sensuality by mitigating the natural punishment of the sensualist, and prolongs existence when the intellect has ceased to retain its entire energy, had no share of his esteem. A life protracted by medical skill he pronounced to be a long death. The exercise of the art of medicine ought, he said, to be tolerated, so far as that art may serve to cure the occasional distempers of men whose constitutions are good. As to those who have bad constitutions, let them die; and the sooner the better. Such men are unfit for war, for magistracy, for the management of their domestic affairs, for severe study and speculation. If they engage in any vigorous mental exercise, they are troubled with giddiness and fulness of the head, all which they lay to the account of philosophy. The best thing that can happen to such wretches is to have done with life at once. He quotes mythical authority in support of this doctrine; and reminds his disciples that the practice of the sons of Aeculapius, as described by Homer, extended only to the cure of external injuries. Far different was the philosophy of Bacon. Of all the sciences, that which he seems to have regarded with the greatest interest was the science which, in Plato's opinion, would not be tolerated in a well-regulated community. To make men perfect was no part of Bacon's plan. His humble aim was to make imperfect men comfortable. The beneficence of his philosophy resembled the beneficence of the common Father, whose sun rises on the evil and the good, whose rain descends for the just and the unjust. In Plato's opinion man was made for philosophy; in Bacon's opinion philosophy was made for man; it was a means to an end; and that end was to increase the pleasures and to mitigate the pains of millions who are not and cannot be philosophers. That a valetudinarian who took great pleasure in being wheeled along his terrace, who relished his boiled chicken, and his weak wine and water, and who enjoyed a hearty laugh over the Queen of Navarre's tales, should be treated as a caput lupinum because he could not read the Timaeus without a headache, was a notion which the humane spirit of the English school of wisdom altogether rejected. Bacon would not have thought it beneath the dignity of a philosopher to contrive an improved garden chair for such a valetudinarian, to devise some way of rendering his medicines more palatable, to invent repasts which he might enjoy, and pillows on which he might sleep soundly; and this though there might not be the smallest hope that the mind of the poor invalid would ever rise to the contemplation of the ideal beautiful and the ideal good. As Plato had cited the religious legends of Greece to justify his contempt for the more recondite parts of the heart of healing, Bacon vindicated the dignity of that art by appealing to the example of Christ, and reminded men that the great physician of the soul did not disdain to be also the physician of the body. [De Augmentis, Lib, iv. Cap.2] When we pass from the science of medicine to that of legislation, we find the same difference between the systems of these two great men. Plato, at the commencement of the Dialogue on Laws, lays it down as a fundamental principle that the end of legislation is to make men virtuous. It is unnecessary to point out the extravagant conclusions to which such a proposition leads. Bacon well knew to how great an extent the happiness of every society must depend on the virtue of its members; and he also knew what legislators can and what they cannot do for the purpose of promoting virtue. The view which he has given of the end of legislation, and of the principal means for the attainment of that end, has always seemed to us eminently happy, even among the many happy passages of the same kind with which his works abound. "Finis et scopus quem leges intueri atque ad quem jussiones et sanctiones suas dirigere debent, non alius est quam ut cives feliciter degant. Id fiet si pietate et religione recte instituti, moribus honesti, armis adversus hostes externos tuti, legum auxilio adversus seditiones et privatas injurias muniti, imperio et magistratibus obsequentes, copiis et opibus locupletes et florentes fuerint." [De Augmentis, Lib. viii. Cap. 3, Aph. 5.] The end is the well-being of the people. The means are the imparting of moral and religious education; the providing of everything necessary for defence against foreign enemies; the maintaining of internal order; the establishing of a judicial, financial, and commercial system, under which wealth may be rapidly accumulated and securely enjoyed. Even with respect to the form in which laws ought to be drawn, there is a remarkable difference of opinion between the Greek and the Englishman. Plato thought a preamble essential; Bacon thought it mischievous. Each was consistent with himself. Plato, considering the moral improvement of the people as the end of legislation, justly inferred that a law which commanded and threatened, but which neither convinced the reason, nor touched the heart, must be a most imperfect law. He was not content with deterring from theft a man who still continued to be a thief at heart, with restraining a son who hated his mother from beating his mother. The only obedience on which he set much value was the obedience which an enlightened understanding yields to reason, and which a virtuous disposition yields to precepts of virtue. He really seems to have believed that, by prefixing to every law an eloquent and pathetic exhortation, he should, to a great extent, render penal enactments superfluous. Bacon entertained no such romantic hopes; and he well knew the practical inconveniences of the course which Plato recommended. "Neque nobis," says he, "prologi legum qui inepti olim habiti sunt, et leges introducunt disputantes non jubentes, utique placerent, si priscos mores ferre possemus. . . . Quantum fieri potest prologi evitentur, et lex incipiat a jussione." [Ibid., Lib. viii. Cap. 3, Aph. 69.] Each of the great men whom we have compared intended to illustrate his system by a philosophical romance; and each left his romance imperfect. Had Plato lived to finish the Critias, a comparison between that noble fiction and the new Atlantis would probably have furnished us with still more striking instances than any which we have given. It is amusing to think with what horror he would have seen such an institution as Solomon's House rising in his republic: with what vehemence he would have ordered the brew-houses, the perfume-houses, and the dispensatories to be pulled down--and with what inexorable rigour he would have driven beyond the frontier all the Fellows of the College, Merchants of Light and Depredators, Lamps and Pioneers. To sum up the whole, we should say that the aim of the Platonic philosophy was to exalt man into a god. The aim of the Baconian philosophy was to provide man with what he requires while he continues to be man. The aim of the Platonic philosophy was to raise us far above vulgar wants. The aim of the Baconian philosophy was to supply our vulgar wants. The former aim was noble; but the latter was attainable. Plato drew a good bow; but, like Acestes in Virgil, he aimed at the stars; and therefore, though there was no want of strength or skill, the shot was thrown away. His arrow was indeed followed by a track of dazzling radiance, but it struck nothing. "Volans liquidis in nubibus arsit arundo Signavitque viam flammis, tenuisque recessit Consumta in ventos." Bacon fixed his eye on a mark which was placed on the earth, and within bow-shot, and hit it in the white. The philosophy of Plato began in words and ended in words, noble words indeed, words such as were to be expected from the finest of human intellects exercising boundless dominion over the finest of human languages. The philosophy of Bacon began in observations and ended in arts. The boast of the ancient philosophers was that their doctrine formed the minds of men to a high degree of wisdom and virtue. This was indeed the only practical good which the most celebrated of those teachers even pretended to effect; and undoubtedly, if they had effected this, they would have deserved far higher praise than if they had discovered the most salutary medicines or constructed the most powerful machines. But the truth is that, in those very matters in which alone they professed to do any good to mankind, in those very matters for the sake of which they neglected all the vulgar interests of mankind, they did nothing, or worse than nothing. They promised what was impracticable; they despised what was practicable; they filled the world with long words and long beards; and they left it as wicked and as ignorant as they found it. An acre in Middlesex is better than a principality in Utopia. The smallest actual good is better than the most magnificent promises of impossibilities. The wise man of the Stoics would, no doubt, be a grander object than a steam-engine. But there are steam- engines. And the wise man of the Stoics is yet to be born. A philosophy which should enable a man to feel perfectly happy while in agonies of pain would be better than a philosophy which assuages pain. But we know that there are remedies which will assuage pain; and we know that the ancient sages liked the toothache just as little as their neighbours. A philosophy which should extinguish cupidity would be better than a philosophy which should devise laws for the security of property. But it is possible to make laws which shall, to a very great extent, secure property. And we do not understand how any motives which the ancient philosophy furnished could extinguish cupidity. We know indeed that the philosophers were no better than other men. From the testimony of friends as well as of foes, from the confessions of Epictetus and Seneca, as well as from the sneers of Lucian and the fierce invectives of Juvenal, it is plain that these teachers of virtue had all the vices of their neighbours, with the additional vice of hypocrisy. Some people may think the object of the Baconian philosophy a low object, but they cannot deny that, high or low, it has been attained. They cannot deny that every year makes an addition to what Bacon called "fruit." They cannot deny that mankind have made, and are making, great and constant progress in the road which he pointed out to them. Was there any such progressive movement among the ancient philosophers? After they had been declaiming eight hundred years, had they made the world better than when they began? Our belief is that, among the philosophers themselves, instead of a progressive improvement there was a progressive degeneracy. An abject superstition which Democritus or Anaxagoras would have rejected with scorn, added the last disgrace to the long dotage of the Stoic and Platonic schools. Those unsuccessful attempts to articulate which are so delightful and interesting in a child shock and disgust in an aged paralytic; and in the same way, those wild and mythological fictions which charm us, when we hear them lisped by Greek poetry in its infancy, excite a mixed sensation of pity and loathing, when mumbled by Greek philosophy in its old age. We know that guns, cutlery, spy-glasses, clocks, are better in our time than they were in the time of our fathers, and were better in the time of our fathers than they were in the time of our grandfathers. We might, therefore, be inclined to think that, when a philosophy which boasted that its object was the elevation and purification of the mind, and which for this object neglected the sordid office of ministering to the comforts of the body, had flourished in the highest honour during many hundreds of years, a vast moral amelioration must have taken place. Was it so? Look at the schools of this wisdom four centuries before the Christian era and four centuries after that era. Compare the men whom those schools formed at those two periods. Compare Plato and Libanius. Compare Pericles and Julian. This philosophy confessed, nay boasted, that for every end but one it was useless. Had it attained that one end? Suppose that Justinian, when he closed the schools of Athens, had called on the last few sages who still haunted the Portico, and lingered round the ancient plane-trees, to show their title to public veneration: suppose that he had said:  "A thousand years have elapsed since, in this famous city, Socrates posed Protagoras and Hippias; during those thousand years a large proportion of the ablest men of every generation has been employed in constant efforts to bring to perfection the philosophy which you teach, that philosophy has been munificently patronised by the powerful; its professors have been held in the highest esteem by the public; it has drawn to itself almost all the sap and vigour of the human intellect: and what has it effected? What profitable truth has it taught us which we should not equally have known without it? What has it enabled us to do which we should not have been equally able to do without it?" Such questions, we suspect, would have puzzled Simplicius and Isidore. Ask a follower of Bacon what the new philosophy, as it was called in the time of Charles the Second, has effected for mankind, and his answer is ready; "It has lengthened life; it has mitigated pain; it has extinguished diseases; it has increased the fertility of the soil; it has given new securities to the mariner; it has furnished new arms to the warrior; it has spanned great rivers and estuaries with bridges of form unknown to our fathers; it has guided the thunderbolt innocuously from heaven to earth; it has lighted up the night with the splendour of the day; it has extended the range of the human vision; it has multiplied the power of the human muscles; it has accelerated motion; it has annihilated distance; it has facilitated intercourse, correspondence, all friendly offices, all despatch of business; it has enabled man to descend to the depths of the sea, to soar into the air, to penetrate securely into the noxious recesses of the earth, to traverse the land in cars which whirl along without horses, and the ocean in ships which run ten knots an hour against the wind. These are but a part of its fruits, and of its first fruits. For it is a philosophy which never rests, which has never attained, which is never perfect. Its law is progress. A point which yesterday was invisible is its goal to-day, and will be its starting-post to-morrow." Great and various as the powers of Bacon were, he owes his wide and durable fame chiefly to this, that all those powers received their direction from common sense. His love of the vulgar useful, his strong sympathy with the popular notions of good and evil, and the openness with which he avowed that sympathy, are the secret of his influence. There was in his system no cant, no illusion. He had no anointing for broken bones, no fine theories de finibus, no arguments to persuade men out of their senses. He knew that men, and philosophers as well as other men, do actually love life, health, comfort, honour, security, the society of friends, and do actually dislike death, sickness, pain, poverty, disgrace, danger, separation from those to whom they are attached. He knew that religion, though it often regulates and moderates these feelings, seldom eradicates them; nor did he think it desirable for mankind that they should be eradicated. The plan of eradicating them by conceits like those of Seneca, or syllogisms like those of Chrysippus, was too preposterous to be for a moment entertained by a mind like his. He did not understand what wisdom there could be in changing names where it was impossible to change things; in denying that blindness, hunger, the gout, the rack, were evils, and calling them apoproegmena in refusing to acknowledge that health, safety, plenty, were good things, and dubbing them by the name of adiaphora. In his opinions on all these subjects, he was not a Stoic, nor an Epicurean, nor an Academic, but what would have been called by Stoics, Epicureans, and Academics a mere idiotes, a mere common man. And it was precisely because he was so that his name makes so great an era in the history of the world. It was because he dug deep that he was able to pile high. It was because, in order to lay his foundations, he went down into those parts of human nature which lie low, but which are not liable to change, that the fabric which he reared has risen to so stately an elevation, and stands with such immovable strength. We have sometimes thought that an amusing fiction might be written, in which a disciple of Epictetus and a disciple of Bacon should be introduced as fellow-travellers. They come to a village where the smallpox has just begun to rage, and find houses shut up, intercourse suspended, the sick abandoned, mothers weeping in terror over their children. The Stoic assures the dismayed population that there is nothing bad in the smallpox, and that to a wise man disease, deformity, death, the loss of friends, are not evils. The Baconian takes out a lancet and begins to vaccinate. They find a body of miners in great dismay. An explosion of noisome vapours has just killed many of those who were at work; and the survivors are afraid to venture into the cavern. The Stoic assures them that such an accident is nothing but a mere apoproegmenon. The Baconian, who has no such fine word at his command, contents himself with devising a safety-lamp. They find a shipwrecked merchant wringing his hands on the shore. His vessel with an inestimable cargo has just gone down, and he is reduced in a moment from opulence to beggary. The Stoic exhorts him not to seek happiness in things which lie without himself, and repeats the whole chapter of Epictetus pros tous ten aporian dediokotas. The Baconian constructs a diving-bell, goes down in it, and returns with the most precious effects from the wreck. It would be easy to multiply illustrations of the difference between the philosophy of thorns and the philosophy of fruit, the philosophy of words and the philosophy of works. Bacon has been accused of overrating the importance of those sciences which minister to the physical well-being of man, and of underrating the importance of moral philosophy; and it cannot be denied that persons who read the Novum Organum and the De Augmentis, without adverting to the circumstances under which those works were written, will find much that may seem to countenance the accusation. It is certain, however, that, though in practice he often went very wrong, and though, as his historical work and his essays prove, he did not hold, even in theory, very strict opinions on points of political morality, he was far too wise a man not to know how much our well-being depends on the regulation of our minds. The world for which he wished was not, as some people seem to imagine, a world of water- wheels, power-looms, steam-carriages, sensualists, and knaves. He would have been as ready as Zeno himself to maintain that no bodily comforts which could be devised by the skill and labour of a hundred generations would give happiness to a man whose mind was under the tyranny of licentious appetite, of envy, of hatred, or of fear. If he sometimes appeared to ascribe importance too exclusively to the arts which increase the outward comforts of our species, the reason is plain. Those arts had been most unduly depreciated. They had been represented as unworthy of the attention of a man of liberal education. " Cogitavit," says Bacon of himself, "eam esse opinionem sive aestimationem humidam et damnosam, minui nempe majestatem mentis humanae, si in experimentis et rebus particularibus, sensui subjectis, et in materia terminatis, diu ac multum versetur: praesertim cum hujusmodi res ad inquirendum laboriosae, ad meditandum ignobiles, ad discendum asperae, ad practicam illiberales, numero infinitae, et subtilitate pusillae videri soleant, et ob hujusmodi conditiones, gloriae artium minus sint accommodatae." [Cogitata et visa. The expression opinio humida may surprise a reader not accustomed to Bacon's style. The allusion is to the maxim of Heraclitus the obscure: "Dry light is the best." By dry light, Bacon understood the light of the intellect, not obscured by the mists of passion, interest, or prejudice.] This opinion seemed to him "omnia in familia humana turbasse." It had undoubtedly caused many arts which were of the greatest utility, and which were susceptible of the greatest improvements, to be neglected by speculators, and abandoned to joiners, masons, smiths, weavers, apothecaries. It was necessary to assert the dignity of those arts, to bring them prominently forward, to proclaim that, as they have a most serious effect on human happiness, they are not unworthy of the attention of the highest human intellects. Again, it was by illustrations drawn from these arts that Bacon could most easily illustrate his principles. It was by improvements effected in these arts that the soundness of his principles could be most speedily and decisively brought to the test, and made manifest to common understandings. He acted like a wise commander who thins every other part of his line to strengthen a point where the enemy is attacking with peculiar fury, and on the fate of which the event of the battle seems likely to depend. In the Novum Organum, however, he distinctly and most truly declares that his philosophy is no less a Moral than a Natural Philosophy, that, though his illustrations are drawn from physical science, the principles which those illustrations are intended to explain are just as applicable to ethical and political inquiries as to inquiries into the nature of heat and vegetation. [Novum Organum, Lib, I. Aph 127.] He frequently treated of moral subjects; and he brought to those subjects that spirit which was the essence of his whole system. He has left us many admirable practicable observations on what he somewhat quaintly called the Georgics of the mind, on the mental culture which tends to produce good dispositions. Some persons, he said, might accuse him of spending labour on a matter so simple that his predecessors had passed it by with contempt. He desired such persons to remember that he had from the first announced the objects of his search to be not the splendid and the surprising, but the useful and the true, not the deluding dreams which go forth through the shining portal of ivory, but the humbler realities of the gate of horn. [De Augmentis, Lib. vii. Cap. 3.] True to this principle, he indulged in no rants about the fitness of things, the all-sufficiency of virtue, and the dignity of human nature. He dealt not at all in resounding nothings, such as those with which Bolingbroke pretended to comfort himself in exile, and in which Cicero vainly sought consolation after the loss of Tullia. The casuistical subtilties which occupied the attention of the keenest spirits of his age had, it should seem, no attractions for him. The doctors whom Escobar afterwards compared to the four beasts and the four-and-twenty elders in the Apocalypse Bacon dismissed with most contemptuous brevity. "Inanes plerumque evadunt et futiles." [Ibid. Lib. vii. Cap. 2.] Nor did he ever meddle with those enigmas which have puzzled hundreds of generations, and will puzzle hundreds more. He said nothing about the grounds of moral obligation, or the freedom of the human will. He had no inclination to employ himself in labours resembling those of the damned in the Grecian Tartarus, to spin for ever on the same wheel round the same pivot, to gape for ever after the same deluding clusters, to pour water for ever into the same bottomless buckets, to pace for ever to and fro on the same wearisome path after the same recoiling stone. He exhorted his disciples to prosecute researches of a very different description, to consider moral science as a practical science, a science of which the object was to cure the diseases and perturbations of the mind, and which could be improved only by a method analogous to that which has improved medicine and surgery. Moral philosophers ought, he said, to set themselves vigorously to work for the purpose of discovering what are the actual effects produced on the human character by particular modes of education, by the indulgence of particular habits, by the study of particular books, by society, by emulation, by imitation. Then we might hope to find out what mode of training was most likely to preserve and restore moral health. [Ibid.: Lib. vii. Cap. 3.] What he was as a natural philosopher and a moral philosopher, that he was also as a theologian. He was, we are convinced, a sincere believer in the divine authority of the Christian revelation. Nothing can be found in his writings, or in any other writings, more eloquent and pathetic than some passages which were apparently written under the influence of strong devotional feeling. He loved to dwell on the power of the Christian religion to effect much that the ancient philosophers could only promise. He loved to consider that religion as the bond of charity, the curb of evil passions, the consolation of the wretched, the support of the timid, the hope of the dying. But controversies on speculative points of theology seem to have engaged scarcely any portion of his attention. In what he wrote on Church Government he showed, as far as he dared, a tolerant and charitable spirit. He troubled himself not at all about Homoousians and Homoiousians, Monothelites and Nestorians. He lived in an age in which disputes on the most subtle points of divinity excited an intense interest throughout Europe, and nowhere more than in England. He was placed in the very thick of the conflict. He was in power at the time of the Synod of Dort, and must for months have been daily deafened with talk about election, reprobation, and final perseverance. Yet we do not remember a line in his works from which it can be inferred that he was either a Calvinist or an Arminian. While the world was resounding with the noise of a disputatious philosophy and a disputatious theology, the Baconian school, like Allworthy seated between Square and Thwackum, preserved a calm neutrality, half scornful, half benevolent, and content with adding to the sum of practical good, left the war of words to those who liked it. We have dwelt long on the end of the Baconian philosophy, because from this peculiarity all the other peculiarities of that philosophy necessary arose. Indeed, scarcely any person who proposed to himself the same end with Bacon could fail to hit upon the same means. The vulgar notion about Bacon we take to be this, that he invented a new method of arriving at truth, which method is called Induction, and that he detected some fallacy in the syllogistic reasoning which had been in vogue before his time. This notion is about as well founded as that of the people who, in the middle ages, imagined that Virgil was a great conjurer. Many who are far too well-informed to talk such extravagant nonsense entertain what we think incorrect notions as to what Bacon really effected in this matter. The inductive method has been practised ever since the beginning of the world by every human being. It is constantly practised by the most ignorant clown, by the most thoughtless schoolboy, by the very child at the breast. That method leads the clown to the conclusion that if he sows barley he shall not reap wheat. By that method the schoolboy learns that a cloudy day is the best for catching trout. The very infant, we imagine, is led by induction to expect milk from his mother or nurse, and none from his father. Not only is it not true that Bacon invented the inductive method; but it is not true that he was the first person who correctly analysed that method and explained its uses. Aristotle had long before pointed out the absurdity of supposing that syllogistic reasoning could ever conduct men to the discovery of any new principle, had shown that such discoveries must be made by induction, and by induction alone, and had given the history of the inductive process, concisely indeed, but with great perspicuity and precision. Again, we are not inclined to ascribe much practical value to that analysis of the inductive method which Bacon has given, in the second book of the Novum Organum. It is indeed an elaborate and correct analysis. But it is an analysis of that which we are all doing from morning to night, and which we continue to do even in our dreams. A plain man finds his stomach out of order. He never heard Lord Bacon's name. But he proceeds in the strictest conformity with the rules laid down in the second book of the Novum Organum, and satisfies himself that minced pies have done the mischief. "I ate minced pies on Monday and Wednesday, and I was kept awake by indigestion all night." This is the comparentia ad intellectum instantiarum convenientium. "I did not eat any on Tuesday and Friday, and I was quite well." This is the comparentia instantiarum in proximo quae natura data privantur. "I ate very sparingly of them on Sunday, and was very slightly indisposed in the evening. But on Christmas-day I almost dined on them, and was so ill that I was in great danger." This is the comparentia instantiarum secundum magis et minus. "It cannot have been the brandy which I took with them. For I have drunk brandy daily for years without being the worse for it." This is the rejectio naturarum. Our invalid then proceeds to what is termed by Bacon the Vindemiatio, and pronounces that minced pies do not agree with him. We repeat that we dispute neither the ingenuity nor the accuracy of the theory contained in the second book of the Novum Organum; but we think that Bacon greatly overrated its utility. We conceive that the inductive process, like many other processes, is not likely to be better performed merely because men know how they perform it. William Tell would not have been one whit more likely to cleave the apple if he had known that his arrow would describe a parabola under the influence of the attraction of the earth. Captain Barclay would not have been more likely to walk a thousand miles in a thousand hours, if he had known the place and name of every muscle in his legs. Monsieur Jourdain probably did not pronounce D and F more correctly after he had been apprised that D is pronounced by touching the teeth with the end of the tongue, and F by putting the upper teeth on the lower lip. We cannot perceive that the study of grammar makes the smallest difference in the speech of people who have always lived in good society. Not one Londoner in ten thousand can lay down the rules for the proper use of will and shall. Yet not one Londoner in a million ever misplaces his will and shall. Dr. Robertson could, undoubtedly, have written a luminous dissertation on the use of those words. Yet, even in his latest work, he sometimes misplaced them ludicrously. No man uses figures of speech with more propriety because he knows that one figure is called a metonymy and another a synecdoche. A drayman in a passion calls out, "You are a pretty fellow.", without suspecting that he is uttering irony, and that irony is one of the four primary tropes. The old systems of rhetoric were never regarded by the most experienced and discerning judges as of any use for the purpose of forming an orator. "Ego hanc vim intelligo," said Cicero, "esse in praeceptis omnibus, non ut ea secuti oratores eloquentiae laudem sint adepti, sed quae sua sponte homines eloquentes facerent, ea quosdam observasse, atque id egisse; sic esse non eloquentiam ex artificio, sed artificium ex eloquentia natum." We must own that we entertain the same opinion concerning the study of Logic which Cicero entertained concerning the study of Rhetoric. A man of sense syllogises in celarent and cesare all day long without suspecting it; and, though he may not know what an ignoratio elenchi is, has no difficulty in exposing it whenever he falls in with it; which is likely to be as often as he falls in with a Reverend Master of Arts nourished on mode and figure in the cloisters of Oxford. Considered merely as an intellectual feat, the Organum of Aristotle can scarcely be admired too highly. But the more we compare individual with individual, school with school, nation with nation, generation with generation, the more do we lean to the opinion that the knowledge of the theory of logic has no tendency whatever to make men good reasoners. What Aristotle did for the syllogistic process Bacon has, in the second book of the Novum Organum, done for the inductive process; that is to say, he has analysed it well. His rules are quite proper, but we do not need them, because they are drawn from our own constant practice. But, though everybody is constantly performing the process described in the second book of the Novum Organum, some men perform it well and some perform it ill. Some are led by it to truth, and some to error. It led Franklin to discover the nature of lightning. It led thousands, who had less brains than Franklin, to believe in animal magnetism. But this was not because Franklin went through the process described by Bacon, and the dupes of Mesmer through a different process. The comparentiae and rejectiones of which we have given examples will be found in the most unsound inductions. We have heard that an eminent judge of the last generation was in the habit of jocosely propounding after dinner a theory, that the cause of the prevalence of Jacobinism was the practice of bearing three names. He quoted on the one side Charles James Fox, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, John Horne Tooke, John Philpot Curran, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Theobald Wolfe Tone. These were instantiae convenientes. He then proceeded to cite instances absentiae in proximo, William Pitt, John Scott, William Windham, Samuel Horsley, Henry Dundas, Edmund Burke. He might have gone on to instances secundum magis et minus. The practice of giving children three names has been for some time a growing practice, and Jacobinism has also been growing. The practice of giving children three names is more common in America than in England. In England we still have a King and a House of Lords; but the Americans are Republicans. The rejectiones are obvious. Burke and Theobald Wolfe Tone are both Irishmen: therefore the being an Irishman is not the cause of Jacobinism. Horsley and Horne Tooke are both clergymen; therefore the being a clergyman is not the cause of Jacobinism. Fox and Windham were both educated at Oxford; therefore the being educated at Oxford is not the cause of Jacobinism. Pitt and Horne Tooke were both educated at Cambridge; therefore the being educated at Cambridge is not the cause of Jacobinism. In this way, our inductive philosopher arrives at what Bacon calls the Vintage, and pronounces that the having three names is the cause of Jacobinism. Here is an induction corresponding with Bacon's analysis and ending in a monstrous absurdity. In what then does this induction differ from the induction which leads us to the conclusion that the presence of the sun is the cause of our having more light by day than by night? The difference evidently is not in the kind of instances, but in the number of instances; that is to say, the difference is not in that part of the process for which Bacon has given precise rules, but in a circumstance for which no precise rule can possibly be given. If the learned author of the theory about Jacobinism had enlarged either of his tables a little, his system would have been destroyed. The names of Tom Paine and William Wyndham Grenville would have been sufficient to do the work. It appears to us, then, that the difference between a sound and unsound induction does not lie in this, that the author of the sound induction goes through the process analysed in the second book of the Novum Organum, and the author of the unsound induction through a different process. They both perform the same process. But one performs it foolishly or carelessly; the other performs it with patience, attention, sagacity, and judgment. Now precepts can do little towards making men patient and attentive, and still less towards making them sagacious and judicious. It is very well to tell men to be on their guard against prejudices, not to believe facts on slight evidence, not to be content with a scanty collection of facts, to put out of their minds the idola which Bacon has so finely described. But these rules are too general to be of much practical use. The question is, What is a prejudice? How long does the incredulity with which I hear a new theory propounded continue to be a wise and salutary incredulity? When does it become an idolum specus, the unreasonable pertinacity of a too sceptical mind? What is slight evidence? What collection of facts is scanty? Will ten instances do, or fifty, or a hundred? In how many months would the first human beings who settled on the shores of the ocean have been justified in believing that the moon had an influence on the tides? After how many experiments would Jenner have been justified in believing that he had discovered a safeguard against the small- pox? These are questions to which it would be most desirable to have a precise answer; but, unhappily, they are questions to which no precise answer can be returned. We think, then, that it is possible to lay down accurate rules, as Bacon has done, for the performing of that part of the inductive process which all men perform alike; but that these rules, though accurate, are not wanted, because in truth they only tell us to do what we are all doing. We think that it is impossible to lay down any precise rule for the performing of that part of the inductive process which a great experimental philosopher performs in one way, and a superstitious old woman in another. On this subject, we think, Bacon was in an error. He certainly attributed to his rules a value which did not belong to them. He went so far as to say, that, if his method of making discoveries were adopted, little would depend on the degree of force or acuteness of any intellect; that all minds would be reduced to one level, that his philosophy resembled a compass or a rule which equalises all hands, and enables the most unpractised person to draw a more correct circle or line than the best draftsmen can produce without such aid. [Novum 0rganum, Praef. and Lib. I Aph. 122.] This really seems to us as extravagant as it would have been in Lindley Murray to announce that everybody who should learn his Grammar would write as good English as Dryden, or in that very able writer, the Archbishop of Dublin, to promise that all the readers of his Logic would reason like Chillingworth, and that all the readers of his Rhetoric would speak like Burke. That Bacon was altogether mistaken as to this point will now hardly be disputed. His philosophy has flourished during two hundred years, and has produced none of this levelling. The interval between a man of talents and a dunce is as wide as ever; and is never more clearly discernible than when they engage in researches which require the constant use of induction. It will be seen that we do not consider Bacon's ingenious analysis of the inductive method as a very useful performance. Bacon was not, as we have already said, the inventor of the inductive method. He was not even the person who first analysed the inductive method correctly, though he undoubtedly analysed it more minutely than any who preceded him. He was not the person who first showed that by the inductive method alone new truth could be discovered. But he was the person who first turned the minds of speculative men, long occupied in verbal disputes, to the discovery of new and useful truth; and, by doing so, he at once gave to the inductive method an importance and dignity which had never before belonged to it. He was not the maker of that road; he was not the discoverer of that road; he was not the person who first surveyed and mapped that road. But he was the person who first called the public attention to an inexhaustible mine of wealth, which had been utterly neglected, and which was accessible by that road alone. By doing so he caused that road, which had previously been trodden only by peasants and higglers, to be frequented by a higher class of travellers. That which was eminently his own in his system was the end which he proposed to himself. The end being given, the means, as it appears to us, could not well be mistaken. If others had aimed at the same object with Bacon, we hold it to be certain that they would have employed the same method with Bacon. It would have been hard to convince Seneca that the inventing of a safety-lamp was an employment worthy of a philosopher. It would have been hard to persuade Thomas Aquinas to descend from the making of syllogisms to the making of gunpowder. But Seneca would never have doubted for a moment that it was only by means of a series of experiments that a safety-lamp could be invented. Thomas Aquinas would never have thought that his barbara and baralipton would enable him to ascertain the proportion which charcoal ought to bear to saltpetre in a pound of gunpowder. Neither common sense nor Aristotle would have suffered him to fall into such an absurdity. By stimulating men to the discovery of new truth, Bacon stimulated them to employ the inductive method, the only method, even the ancient philosophers and the schoolmen themselves being judges, by which new truth can be discovered. By stimulating men to the discovery of useful truth, he furnished them with a motive to perform the inductive process well and carefully. His predecessors had been, in his phrase, not interpreters, but anticipators of nature. They had been content with the first principles at which they had arrived by the most scanty and slovenly induction. And why was this? It was, we conceive, because their philosophy proposed to itself no practical end, because it was merely an exercise of the mind. A man who wants to contrive a new machine or a new medicine has a strong motive to observe accurately and patiently, and to try experiment after experiment. But a man who merely wants a theme for disputation or declamation has no such motive. He is therefore content with premises grounded on assumption, or on the most scanty and hasty induction. Thus, we conceive, the schoolmen acted. On their foolish premises they often argued with great ability; and as their object was "assensum subjugare, non res," [Novum Organum, Lib. i. Aph. 29.] to be victorious in controversy not to be victorious over nature, they were consistent. For just as much logical skill could be shown in reasoning on false as on true premises. But the followers of the new philosophy, proposing to themselves the discovery of useful truth as their object, must have altogether failed of attaining that object if they had been content to build theories on superficial induction. Bacon has remarked [De Augmentis, Lib. i.] that, in ages when philosophy was stationary, the mechanical arts went on improving. Why was this? Evidently because the mechanic was not content with so careless a mode of induction as served the purpose of the philosopher. And why was the philosopher more easily satisfied than the mechanic? Evidently because the object of the mechanic was to mould things, whilst the object of the philosopher was only to mould words. Careful induction is not at all necessary to the making of a good syllogism. But it is indispensable to the making of a good shoe. Mechanics, therefore, have always been, as far as the range of their humble but useful callings extended, not anticipators but interpreters of nature. And when a philosophy arose, the object of which was to do on a large scale what the mechanic does on a small scale, to extend the power and to supply the wants of man, the truth of the premises, which logically is a matter altogether unimportant, became a matter of the highest importance; and the careless induction with which men of learning had previously been satisfied gave place, of necessity, to an induction far more accurate and satisfactory. What Bacon did for inductive philosophy may, we think, be fairly stated thus. The objects of preceding speculators were objects which could be attained without careful induction. Those speculators, therefore, did not perform the inductive process carefully. Bacon stirred up men to pursue an object which could be attained only by induction, and by induction carefully performed; and consequently induction was more carefully performed. We do not think that the importance of what Bacon did for inductive philosophy has ever been overrated. But we think that the nature of his services is often mistaken, and was not fully understood even by himself. It was not by furnishing philosophers with rules for performing the inductive process well, but by furnishing them with a motive for performing it well, that he conferred so vast a benefit on society. To give to the human mind a direction which it shall retain for ages is the rare prerogative of a few imperial spirits. It cannot, therefore, be uninteresting to inquire what was the moral and intellectual constitution which enabled Bacon to exercise so vast an influence on the world. In the temper of Bacon,--we speak of Bacon the philosopher, not of Bacon the lawyer and politician,--there was a singular union of audacity and sobriety. The promises which he made to mankind might, to a superficial reader, seem to resemble the rants which a great dramatist has put into the mouth of ail Oriental conqueror half-crazed by good fortune and by violent passions: "He shall have chariots easier than air, Which I will have invented; and thyself That art the messenger shall ride before him, On a horse cut out of an entire diamond, That shall be made to go with golden wheels, I know not how yet." But Bacon performed what he promised. In truth, Fletcher would not have dared to make Arbaces promise, in his wildest fits of excitement, the tithe of what the Baconian philosophy has performed. The true philosophical temperament may, we think, be described in four words, much hope, little faith; a disposition to believe that anything, however extraordinary, may be done; an indisposition to believe that anything extraordinary has been done. In these points the constitution of Bacon's mind seems to us to have been absolutely perfect. He was at once the Mammon and the Surly of his friend Ben. Sir Epicure did not indulge in visions more magnificent and gigantic, Surly did not sift evidence with keener and more sagacious incredulity. Closely connected with this peculiarity of Bacon's temper was a striking peculiarity of his understanding. With great minuteness of observation, he had an amplitude of comprehension such as has never yet been vouchsafed to any other human being. The small fine mind of Labruyere had not a more delicate tact than the large intellect of Bacon. The Essays contain abundant proofs that no nice feature of character, no peculiarity in the ordering of a house, a garden, or a court-masque, would escape the notice of one whose mind was capable of taking in the whole world of knowledge. His understanding resembled the tent which the fairy Paribanou gave to Prince Ahmed. Fold it; and it seemed a toy for the hand of a lady. Spread it; and the armies of powerful Sultans might repose beneath its shade. In keenness of observation he has been equalled, though perhaps never surpassed. But the largeness of his mind was all his own. The glance with which he surveyed the intellectual universe resembled that which the Archangel, from the golden threshold of heaven, darted down into the new creation: "Round he surveyed,--and well might, where he stood So high above the circling canopy Of night's extended shade,--from eastern point Of Libra, to the fleecy star which bears Andromeda far off Atlantic seas Beyond the horizon." His knowledge differed from that of other men, as a terrestrial globe differs from an Atlas which contains a different country on every leaf. The towns and roads of England, France, and Germany are better laid down in the Atlas than on the globe. But while we are looking at England we see nothing of France; and while we are looking at France we see nothing of Germany. We may go to the Atlas to learn the bearings and distances of York and Bristol, or of Dresden and Prague. But it is useless if we want to know the bearings and distances of France and Martinique, or of England and Canada. On the globe we shall not find all the market towns in our own neighbourhood; but we shall learn from it the comparative extent and the relative position of all the kingdoms of the earth. "I have taken," said Bacon, in a letter written when he was only thirty-one, to his uncle Lord Burleigh, "I have taken all knowledge to be my province." In any other young man, indeed in any other man, this would have been a ridiculous flight of presumption. There have been thousands of better mathematicians, astronomers, chemists, physicians, botanists, mineralogists, than Bacon. No man would go to Bacon's works to learn any particular science or art, any more than he would go to a twelve-inch globe in order to find his way from Kennington turnpike to Clapham Common. The art which Bacon taught was the art of inventing arts. The knowledge in which Bacon excelled all men was a knowledge of the mutual relations of all departments of knowledge. The mode in which he communicated his thoughts was peculiar to him. He had no touch of that disputatious temper which he often censured in his predecessors. He effected a vast intellectual revolution in opposition to a vast mass of prejudices; yet he never engaged in any controversy, nay, we cannot at present recollect, in all his philosophical works, a single passage of a controversial character. All those works might with propriety have been put into the form which he adopted in the work entitled Cogitata et visa: "Franciscus Baconus sic cogitavit." These are thoughts which have occurred to me: weigh them well: and take them or leave them. Borgia said of the famous expedition of Charles the Eighth, that the French had conquered Italy, not with steel, but with chalk for that the only exploit which they had found necessary for the purpose of taking military occupation of any place had been to mark the doors of the houses where they meant to quarter. Bacon often quoted this saying, and loved to apply it to the victories of his own intellect. [Novum Organum, Lib. i. Aph. 35 and elsewhere.] His philosophy, he said, came as a guest, not as an enemy. She found no difficulty in gaining admittance, without a contest, into every understanding fitted, by its structure and by its capacity, to receive her. In all this we think that he acted most judiciously; first, because, as he has himself remarked, the difference between his school and other schools was a difference so fundamental that there was hardly any common ground on which a controversial battle could be fought; and, secondly, because his mind, eminently observant, preeminently discursive and capacious, was, we conceive, neither formed by nature nor disciplined by habit for dialectical combat. Though Bacon did not arm his philosophy with the weapons of logic, he adorned her profusely with all the decorations of rhetoric. His eloquence, though not untainted with the vicious taste of his age, would alone have entitled him to a high rank in literature. He had a wonderful talent for packing thought close, and rendering it portable. In wit, if by wit be meant the power of perceiving analogies between things which appear to have nothing in common, he never had an equal, not even Cowley, not even the author of Hudibras. Indeed, he possessed this faculty, or rather this faculty possessed him, to a morbid degree. When he abandoned himself to it without reserve, as he did in the Sapientia Veterum, and at the end of the second book of the De Augmentis, the feats which he performed were not merely admirable, but portentous, and almost shocking. On those occasions we marvel at him as clowns on a fair-day marvel at a juggler, and can hardly help thinking that the devil must be in him. These, however, were freaks in which his ingenuity now and then wantoned, with scarcely any other object than to astonish and amuse. But it occasionally happened that, when he was engaged in grave and profound investigations, his wit obtained the mastery over all his other faculties, and led him into absurdities into which no dull man could possibly have fallen. We will give the most striking instance which at present occurs to us. In the third book of the De Augmentis he tells us that there are some principles which are not peculiar to one science, but are common to several. That part of philosophy which concerns itself with these principles is, in his nomenclature, designated as philosophia prima. He then proceeds to mention some of the principles with which this philosophia prima is conversant. One of them is this. An infectious disease is more likely to be communicated while it is in progress than when it has reached its height. This, says he, is true in medicine. It is also true in morals; for we see that the example of very abandoned men injures public morality less than the example of men in whom vice has not yet extinguished all good qualities. Again, he tells us that in music a discord ending in a concord is agreeable, and that the same thing may be noted in the affections. Once more, he tells us, that in physics the energy with which a principle acts is often increased by the antiperistasis of its opposite; and that it is the same in the contests of factions. If the making of ingenious and sparkling similitudes like these be indeed the philosophia prima, we are quite sure that the greatest philosophical work of the nineteenth century is Mr. Moore's Lalla Rookh. The similitudes which we have cited are very happy similitudes. But that a man like Bacon should have taken them for more, that he should have thought the discovery of such resemblances as these an important part of philosophy, has always appeared to us one of the most singular facts in the history of letters. The truth is that his mind was wonderfully quick in perceiving analogies of all sorts. But, like several eminent men whom we could name, both living and dead, he sometimes appeared strangely deficient in the power of distinguishing rational from fanciful analogies, analogies which are arguments from analogies which are mere illustrations, analogies like that which Bishop Butler so ably pointed out, between natural and revealed religion, from analogies like that which Addison discovered, between the series of Grecian gods carved by Phidias and the series of English kings painted by Kneller. This want of discrimination has led to many strange political speculations. Sir William Temple deduced a theory of government from the properties of the pyramid. Mr. Southey's whole system of finance is grounded on the phaenomena of evaporation and rain. In theology, this perverted ingenuity has made still wilder work. From the time of Irenaeus and Origen down to the present day, there has not been a single generation in which great divines have not been led into the most absurd expositions of Scripture, by mere incapacity to distinguish analogies proper, to use the scholastic phrase, from analogies metaphorical. [See some interesting remarks on this subject in Bishop Berkeley's Minute Philosopher, Dialogue iv.] It is curious that Bacon has himself mentioned this very kind of delusion among the idola specus; and has mentioned it in language which, we are inclined to think, shows that he knew himself to be subject to it. It is the vice, he tells us, of subtle minds to attach too much importance to slight distinctions; it is the vice, on the other hand, of high and discursive intellects to attach too much importance to slight resemblances; and he adds that, when this last propensity is indulged to excess, it leads men to catch at shadows instead of substances. [Novum Organum, Lib. i. Aph. 55.] Yet we cannot wish that Bacon's wit had been less luxuriant. For, to say nothing of the pleasure which it affords, it was in the vast majority of cases employed for the purpose of making obscure truth plain, of making repulsive truth attractive, of fixing in the mind for ever truth which might otherwise have left but a transient impression. The poetical faculty was powerful in Bacon's mind, but not, like his wit, so powerful as occasionally to usurp the place of his reason, and to tyrannise over the whole man. No imagination was ever at once so strong and so thoroughly subjugated. It never stirred but at a signal from good sense. It stopped at the first check from good sense. Yet, though disciplined to such obedience, it gave noble proofs of its vigour. In truth, much of Bacon's life was passed in a visionary world, amidst things as strange as any that are described in the Arabian Tales, or in those romances on which the curate and barber of Don Quixote's village performed so cruel an auto-de-fe, amidst buildings more sumptuous than the palace of Aladdin, fountains more wonderful than the golden water of Parizade, conveyances more rapid than the hippogryph of Ruggiero, arms more formidable than the lance of Astolfo, remedies more efficacious than the balsam of Fierabras. Yet in his magnificent daydreams there was nothing wild, nothing but what sober reason sanctioned. He knew that all the secrets feigned by poets to have been written in the books of enchanters are worthless when compared with the mighty secrets which are really written in the book of nature, and which, with time and patience, will be read there. He knew that all the wonders wrought by all the talismans in fable were trifles when compared to the wonders which might reasonably be expected from the philosophy of fruit, and that, if his words sank deep into the minds of men, they would produce effects such as superstition had never ascribed to the incantations of Merlin and Michael Scott. It was here that he loved to let his imagination loose. He loved to picture to himself the world as it would be when his philosophy should, in his own noble phrase, "have enlarged the bounds of human empire." [New Atlantis.] We might refer to many instances. But we will content ourselves with the strongest, the description of the House of Solomon in the New Atlantis. By most of Bacon's contemporaries, and by some people of our time, this remarkable passage would, we doubt not, be considered as an ingenious rodomontade, a counterpart to the adventures of Sinbad or Baron Munchausen. The truth is, that there is not to be found in any human composition a passage more eminently distinguished by profound and serene wisdom. The boldness and originality of the fiction is far less wonderful than the nice discernment which carefully excluded from that long list of prodigies everything that can be pronounced impossible, everything that can be proved to lie beyond the mighty magic of induction and time. Already some parts, and not the least startling parts, of this glorious prophecy have been accomplished, even according to the letter; and the whole, construed according to the spirit, is daily accomplishing all around us. One of the most remarkable circumstances in the history of Bacon's mind is the order in which its powers expanded themselves. With him the fruit came first and remained till the last; the blossoms did not appear till late. In general, the development of the fancy is to the development of the judgment what the growth of a girl is to the growth of a boy. The fancy attains at an earlier period to the perfection of its beauty, its power, and its fruitfulness; and, as it is first to ripen, it is also first to fade. It has generally lost something of its bloom and freshness before the sterner faculties have reached maturity; and is commonly withered and barren while those faculties still retain all their energy. It rarely happens that the fancy and the judgment grow together. It happens still more rarely that the judgment grows faster than the fancy. This seems, however, to have been the case with Bacon. His boyhood and youth appear to have been singularly sedate. His gigantic scheme of philosophical reform is said by some writers to have been planned before he was fifteen, and was undoubtedly planned while he was still young. He observed as vigilantly, meditated as deeply, and judged as temperately when he gave his first work to the world as at the close of his long career. But in eloquence, in sweetness and variety of expression, and in richness of illustration, his later writings are far superior to those of his youth. In this respect the history of his mind bears some resemblance to the history of the mind of Burke. The treatise on the Sublime and Beautiful, though written on a subject which the coldest metaphysician could hardly treat without being occasionally betrayed into florid writing, is the most unadorned of all Burke's works. It appeared when he was twenty-five or twenty-six. When, at forty, he wrote the Thoughts on the Causes of the existing Discontents, his reason and his judgment had reached their full maturity; but his eloquence was still in its splendid dawn. At fifty, his rhetoric was quite as rich as good taste would permit; and when he died, at almost seventy, it had become ungracefully gorgeous. In his youth he wrote on the emotions produced by mountains and cascades, by the master-pieces of painting and sculpture, by the faces and necks of beautiful women, in the style of a Parliamentary report. In his old age he discussed treaties and tariffs in the most fervid and brilliant language of romance. It is strange that the Essay on the Sublime and Beautiful, and the Letter to a Noble Lord, should be the productions of one man. But it is far more strange that the Essay should have been a production of his youth, and the Letter of his old age. We will give very short specimens of Bacon's two styles. In 1597, he wrote thus: "Crafty men contemn studies; simple men admire them; and wise men use them; for they teach not their own use: that is a wisdom without them, and won by observation. Read not to contradict, nor to believe, but to weigh and consider. Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested. Reading maketh a full man, conference a ready man, and writing an exact man. And therefore if a man write little, he had need have a great memory; if he confer little, have a present wit; and if he read little, have much cunning to seem to know that he doth not. Histories make men wise, poets witty, the mathematics subtle, natural philosophy deep, morals grave, logic and rhetoric able to contend." It will hardly be disputed that this is a passage to be "chewed and digested." We do not believe that Thucydides himself has anywhere compressed so much thought into so small a space. In the additions which Bacon afterwards made to the Essays, there is nothing superior in truth or weight to what we have quoted. But his style was constantly becoming richer and softer. The following passage, first published in 1625, will show the extent of the change: "Prosperity is the blessing of the Old Testament; adversity is the blessing of the New, which carrieth the greater benediction and the clearer evidence of God's favour. Yet, even in the Old Testament, if you listen to David's harp you shall hear as many hearse-like airs as carols; and the pencil of the Holy Ghost hath laboured more in describing the afflictions of Job than the felicities of Solomon. Prosperity is not without many fears and distastes; and adversity is not without comforts and hopes. We see in needleworks and embroideries it is more pleasing to have a lively work upon a sad and solemn ground, than to have a dark and melancholy work upon a lightsome ground. Judge therefore of the pleasure of the heart by the pleasure of the eye. Certainly virtue is like precious odours, most fragrant when they are incensed or crushed; for prosperity doth best discover vice, but adversity doth best discover virtue." It is by the Essays that Bacon is best known to the multitude. The Novum Organum and the De Augmentis are much talked of, but little read. They have produced indeed a vast effect on the opinions of mankind; but they have produced it through the operation of intermediate agents. They have moved the intellects which have moved the world. It is in the Essays alone that the mind of Bacon is brought into immediate contact with the minds of ordinary readers. There he opens an exoteric school, and talks to plain men, in language which everybody understands, about things in which everybody is interested. He has thus enabled those who must otherwise have taken his merits on trust to judge for themselves; and the great body of readers have, during several generations, acknowledged that the man who has treated with such consummate ability questions with which they are familiar may well be supposed to deserve all the praise bestowed on him by those who have sat in his inner-school. Without any disparagement to the admirable treatise De Augmentis, we must say that, in our judgment, Bacon's greatest performance is the first book of the Novum Organum. All the peculiarities of his extraordinary mind are found there in the highest perfection. Many of the aphorisms, but particularly those in which he gives examples of the influence of the idola, show a nicety of observation that has never been surpassed. Every part of the book blazes with wit, but with wit which is employed only to illustrate and decorate truth. No book ever made so great a revolution in the mode of thinking, overthrew so many prejudices, introduced so many new opinions. Yet no book was ever written in a less contentious spirit. It truly conquers with chalk and not with steel. Proposition after proposition enters into the mind, is received not as an invader, but as a welcome friend, and, though previously unknown, becomes at once domesticated. But what we most admire is the vast capacity of that intellect which, without effort, takes in at once all the domains of science, all the past, the present, and the future, all the errors of two thousand years, all the encouraging signs of the passing times, all the bright hopes of the coming age. Cowley, who was among the most ardent, and not among the least discerning followers of the new philosophy, has, in one of his finest poems, compared Bacon to Moses standing on Mount Pisgah. It is to Bacon, we think, as he appears in the first book of the Novum Organum, that the comparison applies with peculiar felicity. There we see the great Lawgiver looking round from his lonely elevation on an infinite expanse; behind him a wilderness of dreary sands and bitter waters in which successive generations have sojourned, always moving, yet never advancing, reaping no harvest, and building no abiding city; before him a goodly land, a land of promise, a land flowing with milk and honey. While the multitude below saw only the flat sterile desert in which they had so long wandered, bounded on every side by a near horizon, or diversified only by some deceitful mirage, he was gazing from a far higher stand on a far lovelier country, following with his eye the long course of fertilising rivers, through ample pastures, and under the bridges of great capitals, measuring the distances of marts and havens, and portioning out all those wealthy regions from Dan to Beersheba. It is painful to turn back from contemplating Bacon's philosophy to contemplate his life. Yet without so turning back it is impossible fairly to estimate his powers. He left the University at an earlier age than that at which most people repair thither. While yet a boy he was plunged into the midst of diplomatic business. Thence he passed to the study of a vast technical system of law, and worked his way up through a succession of laborious offices to the highest post in his profession. In the meantime he took an active part in every Parliament; he was an adviser of the Crown: he paid court with the greatest assiduity and address to all whose favour was likely to be of use to him; he lived much in society; he noted the slightest peculiarities of character and the slightest changes of fashion. Scarcely any man has led a more stirring life than that which Bacon led from sixteen to sixty. Scarcely any man has been better entitled to be called a thorough man of the world. The founding of a new philosophy, the imparting of a new direction to the minds of speculators, this was the amusement of his leisure, the work of hours occasionally stolen from the Woolsack and the Council Board. This consideration, while it increases the admiration with which we regard his intellect, increases also our regret that such an intellect should so often have been unworthily employed. He well knew the better course  and had, at one time, resolved to pursue it. "I confess," said he in a letter written when he was still young, "that I have as vast contemplative ends as I have moderate civil ends." Had his civil ends continued to be moderate, he would have been, not only the Moses, but the Joshua of philosophy. He would have fulfilled a large part of his own magnificent predictions. He would have led his followers, not only to the verge, but into the heart of the promised land. He would not merely have pointed out, but would have divided the spoil. Above all, he would have left, not only a great, but a spotless name. Mankind would then have been able to esteem their illustrious benefactor. We should not then be compelled to regard his character with mingled contempt and admiration, with mingled aversion and gratitude. We should not then regret that there should be so many proofs of the narrowness and selfishness of a heart, the benevolence of which was large enough to take in all races and all ages. We should not then have to blush for the disingenuousness of the most devoted worshipper of speculative truth, for the servility of the boldest champion of intellectual freedom. We should not then have seen the same man at one time far in the van, and at another time far in the rear of his generation. We should not then be forced to own that he who first treated legislation as a science was among the last Englishmen who used the rack, that he who first summoned philosophers to the great work of interpreting nature was among the last Englishmen who sold justice. And we should conclude our survey of a life placidly, honourably, beneficently passed, "in industrious observations, grounded conclusions, and profitable inventions and discoveries," [From a Letter of Bacon to Lord Burleigh.] with feelings very different from those with which we now turn away from the checkered spectacle of so much glory and so much shame. JOHN BUNYAN (December 1831) The Pilgrim's Progress, with a Life of John Bunyan. By ROBERT SOUTHEY, Esq., LL. D., Poet Laureate. Illustrated with Engravings. 8vo. London: 1831. THIS is an eminently beautiful and splendid edition of a book which well deserves all that the printer and the engraver can do for it. The Life of Bunyan is, of course, not a performance which can add much to the literary reputation of such a writer as Mr. Southey. But it is written in excellent English, and, for the most part, in an excellent spirit. Mr. Southey propounds, we need not say, many opinions from which we altogether dissent; and his attempts to excuse the odious persecution to which Bunyan was subjected have sometimes moved our indignation. But we will avoid this topic. We are at present much more inclined to join in paying homage to, the genius of a great man than to engage in a controversy concerning church-government and toleration. We must not pass without notice the engravings with which this volume is decorated. Some of Mr. Harvey's woodcuts are admirably designed and executed. Mr. Martin's illustrations do not please us quite so well. His Valley of the Shadow of Death is not that Valley of the Shadow of Death which Bunyan imagined. At all events, it is not that dark and horrible glen which has from childhood been in our mind's eye. The valley is a cavern: the quagmire is a lake: the straight path runs zigzag: and Christian appears like a speck in the darkness of the immense vault. We miss, too, those hideous forms which make so striking a part of the description of Bunyan, and which Salvator Rosa would have loved to draw. It is with unfeigned diffidence that we pronounce judgment on any question relating to the art of painting. But it appears to us that Mr. Martin has not of late been fortunate in his choice of subjects. He should never have attempted to illustrate the Paradise Lost. There can be no two manners more directly opposed to each other than the manner of his painting and the manner of Milton's poetry. Those things which are mere accessories in the descriptions become the principal objects in the pictures; and those figures which are most prominent in the descriptions can be detected in the pictures only by a very close scrutiny. Mr. Martin has succeeded perfectly in representing the pillars and candelabras of Pandaemonium. But he has forgotten that Milton's Pandaemonium is merely the background to Satan. In the picture, the Archangel is scarcely visible amidst the endless colonnades of his infernal palace. Milton's Paradise, again, is merely the background to his Adam and Eve. But in Mr. Martin's picture the landscape is everything. Adam, Eve, and Raphael attract much less notice than the lake and the mountains, the gigantic flowers, and the giraffes which feed upon them. We read that James the Second sat to Varelst, the great flower-painter. When the performance was finished, his Majesty appeared in the midst of a bower of sun-flowers and tulips, which completely drew away all attention from the central figure. All who looked at the portrait took it for a flower-piece. Mr. Martin, we think, introduces his immeasurable spaces, his innumerable multitudes, his gorgeous prodigies of architecture and landscape, almost as unseasonably as Varelst introduced his flower-pots and nosegays. If Mr. Martin were to paint Lear in the storm, we suspect that the blazing sky, the sheets of rain, the swollen torrents, and the tossing forest, would draw away all attention from the agonies of the insulted king and father. If he were to paint the death of Lear, the old man, asking the bystanders to undo his button, would be thrown into the shade by a vast blaze of pavilions, standards, armour, and heralds' coats. Mr. Martin would illustrate the Orlando Furioso well, the Orlando Innamorato still better, the Arabian Nights best of all. Fairy palaces and gardens, porticoes of agate, and groves flowering with emeralds and rubies, inhabited by people for whom nobody cares, these are his proper domain. He would succeed admirably in the enchanted ground of Alcina, or the mansion of Aladdin. But he should avoid Milton and Bunyan. The characteristic peculiarity of the Pilgrim's Progress is that it is the only work of its kind which possesses a strong human interest. Other allegories only amuse the fancy. The allegory of Bunyan has been read by many thousands with tears. There are some good allegories in Johnson's works, and some of still higher merit by Addison.    In these performances there is, perhaps, as much wit and ingenuity as in the Progress,  But the pleasure which is produced by the Vision of Mirza, the Vision of Theodore, the Genealogy of Wit, or the Contest between     Rest and Labour, is exactly similar to the pleasure which we derive from one of Cowley's odes, or from a canto of Hudibras. It is a pleasure which belongs wholly to the understanding, and in which the feelings have no part whatever. Nay, even Spenser himself, though assuredly one of the greatest poets that ever lived, could not succeed in the attempt to make allegory interesting. It was in vain that he lavished the riches of his mind on the House of Pride and the House of Temperance. One unpardonable fault, the fault of tediousness, pervades the whole of the Fairy Queen. We become sick of cardinal virtues and deadly sins, and long for the society of plain men and women. Of the persons who read the first canto, not one in ten reaches the end of the first book, and not one in a hundred perseveres to the end of the poem. Very few and very weary are those who are in at the death of the Blatant Beast. If the last six books, which are said to have been destroyed in Ireland, had been preserved, we doubt whether any heart less stout than that of a commentator would have held out to the end. It is not so with the Pilgrim's Progress. That wonderful book, while it obtains admiration from the most fastidious critics, is loved by those who are too simple to admire it. Dr. Johnson, all whose studies were desultory, and who hated, as he said, to read books through, made an exception in favour of the Pilgrim's Progress. That work was one of the two or three works which he wished longer. It was by no common merit that the illiterate sectary extracted praise like this from the most pedantic of critics and the most bigoted of Tories. In the wildest parts of Scotland the Pilgrim's Progress is the delight of the peasantry. In every nursery the Pilgrim's Progress is a greater favourite than Jack the Giant-killer. Every reader knows the straight and narrow path as well as he knows a road in which he has gone backward and forward a hundred times. This is the highest miracle of genius, that things which are not should be as though they were, that the imaginations of one mind should become the personal recollections of another. And this miracle the tinker has wrought. There is no ascent, no declivity, no resting-place, no turn-stile, with which we are not perfectly acquainted. The wicket-gate, and the desolate swamp which separates it from the City of Destruction, the long line of road, as straight as a rule can make it, the Interpreter's house and all its fair shows, the prisoner in the iron cage, the palace, at the doors of which armed men kept guard, and on the battlements of which walked persons clothed all in gold, the cross, and the sepulchre, the steep hill and the pleasant arbour, the stately front of the House Beautiful by the wayside, the chained lions crouching in the porch, the low green valley of Humiliation, rich with grass and covered with flocks, all are as well known to us as the sights of our own street. Then we come to the narrow place where Apollyon strode right across the whole breadth of the way, to stop the journey of Christian, and where, afterwards, the pillar was set up to testify how bravely the pilgrim had fought the good fight. As we advance, the valley becomes deeper and deeper. The shade of the precipices on both sides falls blacker and blacker. The clouds gather overhead. Doleful voices, the clanking of chains, and the rush of many feet to and fro, are heard through the darkness. The way, hardly discernible in gloom, runs close by the mouth of the burning pit, which sends forth its flames, its noisome smoke, and its hideous shapes to terrify the adventurer. Thence he goes on, amidst the snares and pitfalls, with the mangled bodies of those who have perished lying in the ditch by his side. At the end of the long dark valley he passes the dens in which the old giants dwelt, amidst the bones of those whom they had slain. Then the road passes straight on through a waste moor, till at length the towers of a distant city appear before the traveller; and soon he is in the midst of the innumerable multitudes of Vanity Fair. There are the jugglers and the apes, the shops and the puppet-shows. There are Italian Row, and French Row, and Spanish Row, and British Row, with their crowds of buyers, sellers, and loungers, jabbering all the languages of the earth. Thence we go on by the little hill of the silver mine, and through the meadow of lilies, along the bank of that pleasant river which is bordered on both sides by fruit-trees. On the left branches off the path leading to the horrible castle, the courtyard of which is paved with the skulls of pilgrims; and right onward are the sheepfolds and orchards of the Delectable Mountains. From the Delectable Mountains, the way lies through the fogs and briars of the Enchanted Ground, with here and there a bed of soft cushions spread under a green arbour. And beyond is the land of Beulah, where the flowers, the grapes, and the songs of birds never cease, and where the sun shines night and day. Thence are plainly seen the golden pavements and streets of pearl, on the other side of that black and cold river over which there is no bridge. All the stages of the journey, all the forms which cross or overtake the pilgrims, giants, and hobgoblins, ill-favoured ones, and shining ones, the tall, comely, swarthy Madam Bubble, with her great purse by her side, and her fingers playing with the money, the black man in the bright vesture, Mr. Wordly-Wise-man and my Lord Hategood, Mr. Talkative, and Mrs. Timorous, all are actually existing beings to us. We follow the travellers through their allegorical progress with interest not inferior to that with which we follow Elizabeth from Siberia to Moscow, or Jeanie Deans from Edinburgh to London. Bunyan is almost the only writer who ever gave to the abstract the interest of the concrete. In the works of many celebrated authors, men are mere personifications. We have not a jealous man, but jealousy; not a traitor, but perfidy; not a patriot, but patriotism. The mind of Bunyan, on the contrary, was so imaginative that personifications, when he dealt with them, became men. A dialogue between two qualities, in his dream, has more dramatic effect than a dialogue between two human beings in most plays. In this respect the genius of Bunyan bore a great resemblance to that of a man who had very little else in common with him, Percy Bysshe Shelley. The strong imagination of Shelley made him an idolater in his own despite. Out of the most indefinite terms of a hard, cold, dark, metaphysical system, he made a gorgeous Pantheon, full of beautiful, majestic, and life-like forms. He turned atheism itself into a mythology, rich with visions as glorious as the gods that live in the marble of Phidias, or the virgin saints that smile on us from the canvas of Murillo. The Spirit of Beauty, the Principle of Good, the Principle of Evil, when he treated of them, ceased to be abstractions. They took shape and colour. They were no longer mere words; but intelligible forms, fair humanities, objects of love, of adoration, or of fear. As there can be no stronger sign of a mind destitute of the poetical faculty than that tendency which was so common among the writers of the French school to turn images into abstractions, Venus for example, into Love, Minerva into Wisdom, Mars into War, and Bacchus into Festivity, so there can be no stronger sign of a mind truly poetical than a disposition to reverse this abstracting process, and to make individuals out of generalities. Some of the metaphysical and ethical theories of Shelley were certainly most absurd and pernicious. But we doubt whether any modern poet has possessed in an equal degree some of the highest qualities of the great ancient masters. The words bard and inspiration, which seem so cold and affected when applied to other modern writers, have a perfect propriety when applied to him. He was not an author, but a bard. His poetry seems not to have been an art, but an inspiration. Had he lived to the full age of man, he might not improbably have given to the world some great work of the very highest rank in design and execution. But, alas! O daphnis eba roon' ekluse dina ton Mosais philon andra, ton ou Numphaisin apekhthi. But we must return to Bunyan. The Pilgrim's Progress undoubtedly is not a perfect allegory. The types are often inconsistent with each other; and sometimes the allegorical disguise is altogether thrown off. The river, for example, is emblematic of death; and we are told that every human being must pass through the river. But Faithful does not pass through it. He is martyred, not in shadow, but in reality, at Vanity Fair. Hopeful talks to Christian about Esau's birthright and about his own convictions of sin as Bunyan might have talked with one of his own congregation. The damsels at the House Beautiful catechise Christiana's boys, as any good ladies might catechise any boys at a Sunday School. But we do not believe that any man, whatever might be his genius, and whatever his good luck, could long continue a figurative history without falling into many inconsistencies. We are sure that inconsistencies, scarcely less gross than the worst into which Bunyan has fallen, may be found in the shortest and most elaborate allegories of the Spectator and the Rambler. The Tale of a Tub and the History of John Bull swarm with similar errors, if the name of error can be properly applied to that which is unavoidable. It is not easy to make a simile go on all-fours. But we believe that no human ingenuity could produce such a centipede as a long allegory in which the correspondence between the outward sign and the thing signified should be exactly preserved. Certainly no writer, ancient or modern, has yet achieved the adventure. The best thing, on the whole, that an allegorist can do, is to present to his readers a succession of analogies, each of which may separately be striking and happy, without looking very nicely to see whether they harmonise with each other. This Bunyan has done; and, though a minute scrutiny may detect inconsistencies in every page of his tale, the general effect which the tale produces on all persons, learned and unlearned, proves that he has done well. The passages which it is most difficult to defend are those in which he altogether drops the allegory, and puts into the mouth of his pilgrims religious ejaculations and disquisitions better suited to his own pulpit at Bedford or Reading than to the Enchanted Ground or to the Interpreter's Garden. Yet even these passages, though we will not undertake to defend them against the objections of critics, we feel that we could ill spare. We feel that the story owes much of its charm to these occasional glimpses of solemn and affecting subjects, which will not be hidden, which force themselves through the veil, and appear before us in their native aspect. The effect is not unlike that which is said to have been produced on the ancient stage, when the eyes of the actor were seen flaming through his mask, and giving life and expression to what would else have been an inanimate and uninteresting disguise. It is very amusing and very instructive to compare the Pilgrim's Progress with the Grace Abounding. The latter work is indeed one of the most remarkable pieces of autobiography in the world. It is a full and open confession of the fancies which passed through the mind of an illiterate man, whose affections were warm, whose nerves were irritable, whose imagination was ungovernable, and who was under the influence of the strongest religious excitement. In whatever age Bunyan had lived, the history of his feelings would, in all probability, have been very curious. But the time in which his lot was cast was the time of a great stirring of the human mind. A tremendous burst of public feeling, produced by the tyranny of the hierarchy, menaced the old ecclesiastical institutions with destruction. To the gloomy regularity of one intolerant Church had succeeded the licence of innumerable sects, drunk with the sweet and heady must of their new liberty. Fanaticism, engendered by persecution, and destined to engender persecution in turn, spread rapidly through society. Even the strongest and most commanding minds were not proof against this strange taint. Any time might have produced George Fox and James Naylor. But to one time alone belong the fanatic delusions of such a statesman as Vane, and the hysterical tears of such a soldier as Cromwell. The history of Bunyan is the history of a most excitable mind in an age of excitement. By most of his biographers he has been treated with gross injustice. They have understood in a popular sense all those strong terms of self-condemnation which he employed in a theological sense. They have, therefore, represented him as an abandoned wretch, reclaimed by means almost miraculous, or, to use their favourite metaphor, "as a brand plucked from the burning." Mr. Ivimey calls him the depraved Bunyan and the wicked tinker of Elstow. Surely Mr. Ivimey ought to have been too familiar with the bitter accusations which the most pious people are in the habit of bringing against themselves, to understand literally all the strong expressions which are to be found in the Grace Abounding. It is quite clear, as Mr. Southey most justly remarks, that Bunyan never was a vicious man. He married very early; and he solemnly declares that he was strictly faithful to his wife. He does not appear to have been a drunkard. He owns, indeed, that, when a boy, he never spoke without an oath. But a single admonition cured him of this bad habit for life; and the cure must have been wrought early; for at eighteen he was in the army of the Parliament; and if he had carried the vice of profaneness into that service, he would doubtless have received something more than an admonition from Serjeant Bind-their-kings-in-chains, or Captain Hew-Agag-in- pieces-before-the-Lord. Bell-ringing and playing at hockey on Sundays seem to have been the worst vices of this depraved tinker. They would have passed for virtues with Archbishop Laud. It is quite clear that, from a very early age, Bunyan was a man of a strict life and of a tender conscience. "He had been," says Mr. Southey, "a blackguard." Even this we think too hard a censure. Bunyan was not, we admit, so fine a gentleman as Lord Digby; but he was a blackguard no otherwise than as every labouring man that ever lived has been a blackguard. Indeed Mr. Southey acknowledges this. "Such he might have been expected to be by his birth, breeding, and vocation. Scarcely, indeed, by possibility, could he have been otherwise." A man whose manners and sentiments are decidedly below those of his class deserves to be called a blackguard. But it is surely unfair to apply so strong a word of reproach to one who is only what the great mass of every community must inevitably be. Those horrible internal conflicts which Bunyan has described with so much power of language prove, not that he was a worse man than his neighbours, but that his mind was constantly occupied by religious considerations, that his fervour exceeded his knowledge, and that his imagination exercised despotic power over his body and mind. He heard voices from heaven. He saw strange visions of distant hills, pleasant and sunny as his own Delectable Mountains. From those abodes he was shut out, and placed in a dark and horrible wilderness, where he wandered through ice and snow, striving to make his way into the happy region of light. At one time he was seized with an inclination to work miracles. At another time he thought himself actually possessed by the devil. He could distinguish the blasphemous whispers. He felt his infernal enemy pulling at his clothes behind him. He spurned with his feet and struck with his hands at the destroyer. Sometimes he was tempted to sell his part in the salvation of mankind. Sometimes a violent impulse urged him to start up from his food, to fall on his knees, and to break forth into prayer. At length he fancied that he had committed the unpardonable sin. His agony convulsed his robust frame. He was, he says, as if his breastbone would split; and this he took for a sign that he was destined to burst asunder like Judas. The agitation of his nerves made all his movements tremulous; and this trembling, he supposed, was a visible mark of his reprobation, like that which had been set on Cain. At one time, indeed, an encouraging voice seemed to rush in at the window, like the noise of wind, but very pleasant, and commanded, as he says, a great calm in his soul. At another time, a word of comfort "was spoke loud unto him; it showed a great word; it seemed to be writ in great letters." But these intervals of case were short. His state, during two years and a half, was generally the most horrible that the human mind can imagine. "I walked," says he, with his own peculiar eloquence, "to a neighbouring town; and sat down upon a settle in the street, and fell into a very deep pause about the most fearful state my sin had brought me to; and, after long musing, I lifted up my head; but methought I saw as if the sun that shineth in the heavens did grudge to give me light; and as if the very stones in the street, and tiles upon the houses, did band themselves against me. Methought that they all combined together to banish me out of the world. I was abhorred of them, and unfit to dwell among them, because I had sinned against the Saviour. Oh, how happy now was every creature for they stood fast, and kept their station. But I was gone and lost." Scarcely any madhouse could produce an instance of delusion so strong, or of misery so acute. It was through this Valley of the Shadow of Death, overhung by darkness, peopled with devils, resounding with blasphemy and lamentation, and passing amidst quagmires, snares, and pitfalls, close by the very mouth of hell, that Bunyan journeyed to that bright and fruitful land of Beulah, in which he sojourned during the latter period of his pilgrimage. The only trace which his cruel sufferings and temptations seem to have left behind them was an affectionate compassion for those who were still in the state in which he had once been. Religion has scarcely ever worn a form so calm and soothing as in his allegory. The feeling which predominates through the whole book is a feeling of tenderness for weak, timid, and harassed minds. The character of Mr. Fearing, of Mr. Feeble-Mind, of Mr. Despondency and his daughter Miss Much-afraid, the account of poor Little-faith who was robbed by the three thieves of his spending money, the description of Christian's terror in the dungeons of Giant Despair and in his passage through the river, all clearly show how strong a sympathy Bunyan felt, after his own mind had become clear and cheerful, for persons afflicted with religious melancholy. Mr. Southey, who has no love for the Calvinists, admits that, if Calvinism had never worn a blacker appearance than in Bunyan's works, it would never have become a term of reproach. In fact, those works of Bunyan with which we are acquainted are by no means more Calvinistic than the articles and homilies of the Church of England. The moderation of his opinions on the subject of predestination gave offence to some zealous persons. We have seen an absurd allegory, the heroine of which is named Hephzibah, written by some raving supralapsarian preacher who was dissatisfied with the mild theology of the Pilgrim's Progress. In this foolish book, if we recollect rightly, the Interpreter is called the Enlightener, and the House Beautiful is Castle Strength. Mr. Southey tells us that the Catholics had also their Pilgrim's Progress, without a Giant Pope, in which the Interpreter is the Director, and the House Beautiful Grace's Hall. It is surely a remarkable proof of the power of Bunyan's genius, that two religious parties, both of which regarded his opinions as heterodox, should have had recourse to him for assistance. There are, we think, some characters and scenes in the Pilgrim's Progress, which can be fully comprehended and enjoyed only by persons familiar with the history of the times through which Bunyan lived. The character of Mr. Greatheart, the guide, is an example. His fighting is, of course, allegorical; but the allegory is not strictly preserved. He delivers a sermon on imputed righteousness to his companions; and, soon after, he gives battle to Giant Grim, who had taken upon him to back the lions. He expounds the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah to the household and guests of Gaius; and then he sallies out to attack Slay-good, who was of the nature of flesh-eaters, in his den. These are inconsistencies; but they are inconsistencies which add, we think, to the interest of the narrative. We have not the least doubt that Bunyan had in view some stout old Great-heart of Naseby and Worcester, who prayed with his men before he drilled them, who knew the spiritual state of every dragoon in his troop, and who, with the praises of God in his mouth, and a two-edged sword in his hand, had turned to flight, on many fields of battle, the swearing, drunken bravoes of Rupert and Lunsford. Every age produces such men as By-ends. But the middle of the seventeenth century was eminently prolific of such men. Mr. Southey thinks that the satire was aimed at some particular individual; and this seems by no means improbable. At all events Bunyan must have known many of those hypocrites who followed religion only when religion walked in silver slippers, when the sun shone, and when the people applauded. Indeed he might have easily found all the kindred of By-ends among the public men of his time. He might have found among the peers my Lord Turn-about, my Lord Time-server, and my Lord Fair-speech; in the House of Commons, Mr. Smooth-man, Mr. Anything, and Mr. Facing-both-ways; nor would "the parson of the parish, Mr. Two-tongues," have been wanting. The town of Bedford probably contained more than one politician who, after contriving to raise an estate by seeking the Lord during the reign of the saints, contrived to keep what he had got by persecuting the saints during the reign of the strumpets, and more than one priest who, during repeated changes in the discipline and doctrines of the Church, had remained constant to nothing but his benefice. One of the most remarkable passages in the Pilgrim's Progress is that in which the proceedings against Faithful are described. It is impossible to doubt that Bunyan intended to satirise the mode in which state trials were conducted under Charles the Second. The licence given to the witnesses for the prosecution, the shameless partiality and ferocious insolence of the judge, the precipitancy and the blind rancour of the jury, remind us of those odious mummeries which, from the Restoration to the Revolution, were merely forms preliminary to hanging, drawing, and quartering. Lord Hate-good performs the office of counsel for the prisoners as well as Scroggs himself could have performed it. "JUDGE. Thou runagate, heretic, and traitor, hast thou heard what these honest gentlemen have witnessed against thee? "FAITHFUL. May I speak a few words in my own defence? "JUDGE. Sirrah, sirrah! thou deservest to live no longer, but to be slain immediately upon the place; yet, that all men may see our gentleness towards thee, let us hear what thou, vile runagate, hast to say." No person who knows the state trials can be at a loss for parallel cases. Indeed, write what Bunyan would, the baseness and cruelty of the lawyers of those times "sinned up to it still," and even went beyond it. The imaginary trial of Faithful, before a jury composed of personified vices, was just and merciful, when compared with the real trial of Alice Lisle before that tribunal where all the vices sat in the person of Jeffreys. The style of Bunyan is delightful to every reader, and invaluable as a study to every person who wishes to obtain a wide command over the English language. The vocabulary is the vocabulary of the common people. There is not an expression, if we except a few technical terms of theology, which would puzzle the rudest peasant. We have observed several pages which do not contain a single word of more than two syllables. Yet no writer has said more exactly what he meant to say. For magnificence, for pathos, for vehement exhortation, for subtle disquisition, for every purpose of the poet, the orator, and the divine, this homely dialect, the dialect of plain working men, was perfectly sufficient. There is no book in our literature on which we would so readily stake the fame of the old unpolluted English language, no book which shows so well how rich that language is in its own proper wealth, and how little it has been improved by all that it has borrowed. Cowper said, forty or fifty years ago, that he dared not name John Bunyan in his verse, for fear of moving a sneer. To our refined forefathers, we suppose, Lord Roscommon's Essay on Translated Verse, and the Duke of Buckinghamshire's Essay on Poetry, appeared to be compositions infinitely superior to the allegory of the preaching tinker. We live in better times; and we are not afraid to say, that, though there were many clever men in England during the latter half of the seventeenth century, there were only two minds which possessed the imaginative faculty in a very eminent degree. One of those minds produced the Paradise Lost, the other the Pilgrim's Progress. LEIGH HUNT (January 1841) The Dramatic Works of WYCHERLEY, CONGREVE, VANBRUGH, and FARQUHAR, with Biographical and Critical Notices. By LEIGH HUNT. 8vo. London: 1840. WE have a kindness for Mr. Leigh Hunt. We form our judgment of him, indeed, only from events of universal notoriety, from his own works, and from the works of other writers, who have generally abused him in the most rancorous manner. But, unless we are greatly mistaken, he is a very clever, a very honest, and a very good-natured man. We can clearly discern, together with many merits, many faults both in his writings and in his conduct. But we really think that there is hardly a man living whose merits have been so grudgingly allowed, and whose faults have been so cruelly expiated. In some respects Mr. Leigh Hunt is excellently qualified for the task which he has now undertaken. His style, in spite of its mannerism, nay, partly by reason of its mannerism, is well-suited for light, garrulous, desultory ana, half critical, half biographical. We do not always agree with his literary judgments; but we find in him what is very rare in our time, the power of justly appreciating and heartily enjoying good things of very different kinds. He can adore Shakspeare and Spenser without denying poetical genius to the author of Alexander's Feast, or fine observation, rich fancy and exquisite humour to him who imagined Will Honeycomb and Sir Roger de Coverley. He has paid particular attention to the history of the English drama, from the age of Elizabeth down to our own time, and has every right to be heard with respect on that subject. The plays to which he now acts as introducer are, with few exceptions, such as, in the opinion of many very respectable people, ought not to be reprinted. In this opinion we can by no means concur. We cannot wish that any work or class of works which has exercised a great influence on the human mind, and which illustrates the character of an important epoch in letters, politics, and morals, should disappear from the world. If we err in this matter, we err with the gravest men and bodies of men in the empire, and especially with the Church of England, and with the great schools of learning which are connected with her. The whole liberal education of our countrymen is conducted on the principle, that no book which is valuable, either by reason of the excellence of its style, or by reason of the light which it throws on the history, polity, and manners of nations, should be withheld from the student on account of its impurity. The Athenian Comedies, in which there are scarcely a hundred lines together without some passage of which Rochester would have been ashamed, have been reprinted at the Pitt Press, and the Clarendon Press, under the direction of Syndics, and delegates appointed by the Universities, and have been illustrated with notes by reverend, very reverend, and right reverend commentators. Every year the most distinguished young men in the kingdom are examined by bishops and professors of divinity in such works as the Lysistrata of Aristophanes and the Sixth Satire of Juvenal. There is certainly something a little ludicrous in the idea of a conclave of venerable fathers of the Church praising and rewarding a lad on account of his intimate acquaintance with writings compared with which the loosest tale in Prior is modest. But, for our own part, we have no doubt that the greatest societies which direct the education of the English gentry have herein judged wisely. It is unquestionable that an extensive acquaintance with ancient literature enlarges and enriches the mind. It is unquestionable that a man whose mind has been thus enlarged and enriched is likely to be far more useful to the State and to the Church than one who is unskilled or little skilled, in classical learning. On the other hand, we find it difficult to believe that, in a world so full of temptation as this, any gentleman whose life would have been virtuous if he had not read Aristophanes and Juvenal will be made vicious by reading them. A man who, exposed to all the influences of such a state of society as that in which we live, is yet afraid of exposing himself to the influences of a few Greek or Latin verses, acts, we think, much like the felon who begged the sheriffs to let him have an umbrella held over his head from the door of Newgate to the gallows, because it was a drizzling morning, and he was apt to take cold. The virtue which the world wants is a healthful virtue, not a valetudinarian virtue, a virtue which can expose itself to the risks inseparable from all spirited exertion, not a virtue which keeps out of the common air for fear of infection, and eschews the common food as too stimulating. It would be indeed absurd to attempt to keep men from acquiring those qualifications which fit them to play their part in life with honour to themselves and advantage to their country, for the sake of preserving a delicacy which cannot be preserved, a delicacy which a walk from Westminster to the Temple is sufficient to destroy. But we should be justly chargeable with gross inconsistency if, while we defend the policy which invites the youth of our country to study such writers as Theocritus and Catullus, we were to set up a cry against a new edition of the Country Wife or the Wife of the World. The immoral English writers of the seventeenth century are indeed much less excusable than those of Greece and Rome. But the worst English writings of the seventeenth century are decent, compared with much that has been bequeathed to us by Greece and Rome. Plato, we have little doubt, was a much better man than Sir George Etherege. But Plato has written things at which Sir George Etherege would have shuddered. Buckhurst and Sedley, even in those wild orgies at the Cock in Bow Street for which they were pelted by the rabble and fined by the Court of King's Bench, would never have dared to hold such discourse as passed between Socrates and Phaedrus on that fine summer day under the plane- tree, while the fountain warbled at their feet, and the cicadas chirped overhead. If it be, as we think it is, desirable that an English gentleman should be well informed touching the government and the manners of little commonwealths which both in place and time are far removed from us, whose independence has been more than two thousand years extinguished, whose language has not been spoken for ages, and whose ancient magnificence is attested only by a few broken columns and friezes, much more must it be desirable that he should be intimately acquainted with the history of the public mind of his own country, and with the causes, the nature, and the extent of those revolutions of opinion and feeling which, during the last two centuries, have alternately raised and depressed the standard of our national morality. And knowledge of this sort is to be very sparingly gleaned from Parliamentary debates, from State papers, and from the works of grave historians. It must either not be acquired at all, or it must be acquired by the perusal of the light literature which has at various periods been fashionable. We are therefore by no means disposed to condemn this publication, though we certainly cannot recommend the handsome volume before us as an appropriate Christmas present for young ladies. We have said that we think the present publication perfectly justifiable. But we can by no means agree with Mr. Leigh Hunt, who seems to hold that there is little or no ground for the charge of immorality so often brought against the literature of the Restoration. We do not blame him for not bringing to the judgment-seat the merciless rigour of Lord Angelo; but we really think that such flagitious and impudent offenders as those who are now at the bar deserved at least the gentle rebuke of Escalus. Mr. Leigh Hunt treats the whole matter a little too much in the easy style of Lucio; and perhaps his exceeding lenity disposes us to be somewhat too severe. And yet it is not easy to be too severe. For in truth this part of our literature is a disgrace to our language and our national character. It is clever, indeed, and very entertaining; but it is, in the most emphatic sense of the words, "earthly, sensual, devilish." Its indecency, though perpetually such as is condemned not less by the rules of good taste than by those of morality, is not, in our opinion, so disgraceful a fault as its singularly inhuman spirit. We have here Belial, not as when he inspired Ovid and Ariosto, "graceful and humane," but with the iron eye and cruel sneer of Mephistopheles. We find ourselves in a world, in which the ladies are like very profligate, impudent and unfeeling men, and in which the men are too bad for any place but Pandaemonium or Norfolk Island. We are surrounded by foreheads of bronze, hearts like the nether millstone, and tongues set on fire of hell. Dryden defended or excused his own offences and those of his contemporaries by pleading the example of the earlier English dramatists; and Mr. Leigh Hunt seems to think there is force in the plea. We altogether differ from this opinion. The crime charged is not mere coarseness of expression. The terms which are delicate in one age become gross in the next. The diction of the English version of the Pentateuch is sometimes such as Addison would not have ventured to imitate; and Addison, the standard of moral purity in his own age, used many phrases which are now proscribed. Whether a thing shall be designated by a plain noun-substantive or by a circumlocution is mere matter of fashion. Morality is not at all interested in the question. But morality is deeply interested in this, that what is immoral shall not be presented to the imagination of the young and susceptible in constant connection with what is attractive. For every person who has observed the operation of the law of association in his own mind and in the minds of others knows that whatever is constantly presented to the imagination in connection with what is attractive will itself become attractive. There is undoubtedly a great deal of indelicate writing in Fletcher and Massinger, and more than might be wished even in Ben Jonson and Shakspeare, who are comparatively pure. But it is impossible to trace in their plays any systematic attempt to associate vice with those things which men value most and desire most, and virtue with every thing ridiculous and degrading. And such a systematic attempt we find in the whole dramatic literature of the generation which followed the return of Charles the Second. We will take, as an instance of what we mean, a single subject of the highest importance to the happiness of mankind, conjugal fidelity. We can at present hardly call to mind a single English play, written before the civil war, in which the character of a seducer of married women is represented in a favourable light. We remember many plays in which such persons are baffled, exposed, covered with derision, and insulted by triumphant husbands. Such is the fate of Falstaff, with all his wit and knowledge of the world. Such is the fate of Brisac in Fletcher's Elder Brother, and of Ricardo and Ubaldo in Massinger's Picture. Sometimes, as in the Fatal Dowry and Love's Cruelty, the outraged honour of families is repaired by a bloody revenge. If now and then the lover is represented as an accomplished man, and the husband as a person of weak or odious character, this only makes the triumph of female virtue the more signal, as in Johnson's Celia and Mrs. Fitzdottrel, and in Fletcher's Maria. In general we will venture to say that the dramatists of the age of Elizabeth and James the First either treat the breach Of the marriage-vow as a serious crime, or, if they treat it as matter for laughter, turn the laugh against the gallant. On the contrary, during the forty years which followed the Restoration, the whole body of the dramatists invariably represent adultery, we do not say as a peccadillo, we do not say as an error which the violence of passion may excuse, but as the calling of a fine gentleman, as a grace without which his character would be imperfect. It is as essential to his breeding and to his place in society that he should make love to the wives of his neighbours as that he should know French, or that he should have a sword at his side. In all this there is no passion, and scarcely anything that can be called preference. The hero intrigues just as he wears a wig; because, if he did not, he would be a queer fellow, a city prig, perhaps a Puritan. All the agreeable qualities are always given to the gallant. All the contempt and aversion are the portion of the unfortunate husband. Take Dryden for example; and compare Woodall with Brainsick, or Lorenzo with Gomez. Take Wycherley; and compare Horner with Pinchwife. Take Vanbrugh; and compare Constant with Sir John Brute. Take Farquhar; and compare Archer with Squire Sullen. Take Congreve; and compare Bellmour with Fondlewife, Careless with Sir Paul Plyant, or Scandal with Foresight. In all these cases, and in many more which might be named, the dramatist evidently does his best to make the person who commits the injury graceful, sensible, and spirited, and the person who suffers it a fool, or a tyrant, or both. Mr. Charles Lamb, indeed, attempted to set up a defence for this way of writing. The dramatists of the latter part of the seventeenth century are not, according to him, to be tried by the standard of morality which exists, and ought to exist in real life. Their world is a conventional world. Their heroes and heroines belong, not to England, not to Christendom, but to an Utopia of gallantry, to a Fairyland, where the Bible and Burn's justice are unknown, where a prank which on this earth would be rewarded with the pillory is merely matter for a peal of elvish laughter. A real Homer, a real Careless, would, it is admitted, be exceedingly bad men. But to predicate morality or immorality of the Horner of Wycherley and the Careless of Congreve is as absurd as it would be to arraign a sleeper for his dreams. "They belong to the regions of pure comedy, where no cold moral reigns. When we are among them we are among a chaotic people. We are not to judge them by our usages. No reverend institutions are insulted by their proceedings, for they have none among them. No peace of families is violated, for no family ties exist among them. There is neither right nor wrong, gratitude or its opposite, claim or duty, paternity or sonship." This is, we believe, a fair summary of Mr. Lamb's doctrine. We are sure that we do not wish to represent him unfairly. For we admire his genius; we love the kind nature which appears in all his writings; and we cherish his memory as much as if we had known him personally. But we must plainly say that his argument, though ingenious, is altogether sophistical. Of course we perfectly understand that it is possible for a writer to create a conventional world in which things forbidden by the Decalogue and the Statute Book shall be lawful, and yet that the exhibition may be harmless, or even edifying. For example, we suppose that the most austere critics would not accuse Fenelon of impiety and immorality on account of his Telemachus and his Dialogues of the Dead. In Telemachus and the Dialogues of the Dead we have a false religion, and consequently a morality which is in some points incorrect. We have a right and a wrong differing from the right and the wrong of real life. It is represented as the first duty of men to pay honour to Jove and Minerva. Philocles, who employs his leisure in making graven images of these deities, is extolled for his piety in a way which contrasts singularly with the expressions of Isaiah on the same subject. The dead are judged by Minos, and rewarded with lasting happiness for actions which Fenelon would have been the first to pronounce splendid sins. The same may be said of Mr. Southey's Mahommedan and Hindoo heroes and heroines. In Thalaba, to speak in derogation of the Arabian impostor is blasphemy: to drink wine is a crime: to perform ablutions and to pay honour to the holy cities are works of merit. In the Curse of Kehama, Kailyal is commended for her devotion to the statue of Mariataly, the goddess of the poor. But certainly no person will accuse Mr. Southey of having promoted or intended to promote either Islamism or Brahminism. It is easy to see why the conventional worlds of Fenelon and Mr. Southey are unobjectionable. In the first place, they are utterly unlike the real world in which we live. The state of society, the laws even of the physical world, are so different from those with which we are familiar, that we cannot be shocked at finding the morality also very different. But in truth the morality of these conventional worlds differs from the morality of the real world only in points where there is no danger that the real world will ever go wrong. The generosity and docility of Telemachus, the fortitude, the modesty, the filial tenderness of Kailyal, are virtues of all ages and nations. And there was very little danger that the Dauphin would worship Minerva, or that an English damsel would dance, with a bucket on her head, before the statue of Mariataly. The case is widely different with what Mr. Charles Lamb calls the conventional world of Wycherley and Congreve. Here the garb, the manners, the topics of conversation are those of the real town and of the passing day. The hero is in all superficial accomplishments exactly the fine gentleman whom every youth in the pit would gladly resemble. The heroine is the fine lady whom every youth in the pit would gladly marry. The scene is laid in some place which is as well known to the audience as their own houses, in St. James's Park, Park, or Hyde Park, or Westminster Hall. The lawyer bustles about with his bag, between the Common Pleas and the Exchequer. The Peer calls for his carriage to go to the House of Lords on a private bill. A hundred little touches are employed to make the fictitious world appear like the actual world. And the immorality is of a sort which never can be out of date, and which all the force of religion, law, and public opinion united can but imperfectly restrain. In the name of art, as well as in the name of virtue, we protest against the principle that the world of pure comedy is one into which no moral enters. If comedy be an imitation, under whatever conventions, of real life, how is it possible that it can have no reference to the great rule which directs life, and to feelings which are called forth by every incident of life? If what Mr. Charles Lamb says were correct, the inference would be that these dramatists did not in the least understand the very first principles of their craft. Pure landscape-painting into which no light or shade enters, pure portrait-painting into which no expression enters, are phrases less at variance with sound criticism than pure comedy into which no moral enters. But it is not the fact that the world of these dramatists is a world into which no moral enters. Morality constantly enters into that world, a sound morality, and an unsound morality; the sound morality to be insulted, derided, associated with everything mean and hateful; the unsound morality to be set off to every advantage, and inculcated by all methods, direct and indirect. It is not the fact that none of the inhabitants of this conventional world feel reverence for sacred institutions and family ties. Fondlewife, Pinchwife, every person in short of narrow understanding and disgusting manners, expresses that reverence strongly. The heroes and heroines, too, have a moral code of their own, an exceedingly bad one, but not, as Mr. Charles Lamb seems to think, a code existing only in the imagination of dramatists. It is, on the contrary, a code actually received and obeyed by great numbers of people. We need not go to Utopia or Fairyland to find them. They are near at hand. Every night some of them cheat at the hells in the Quadrant, and others pace the Piazza in Covent Garden. Without flying to Nephelococcygia or to the Court of Queen Mab, we can meet with sharpers, bullies, hard- hearted impudent debauchees, and women worthy of such paramours. The morality of the Country Wife and the Old Bachelor is the morality, not, as Mr. Charles Lamb maintains, of an unreal world, but of a world which is a great deal too real. It is the morality, not of a chaotic people, but of low town-rakes, and of those ladies whom the newspapers call "dashing Cyprians." And the question is simply this, whether a man of genius who constantly and systematically endeavours to make this sort of character attractive, by uniting it with beauty, grace, dignity, spirit, a high social position, popularity, literature, wit, taste, knowledge of the world, brilliant success in every undertaking, does or does not make an ill use of his powers. We own that we are unable to understand how this question can be answered in any way but one. It must, indeed, be acknowledged, in justice to the writers of whom we have spoken thus severely, that they were to a great extent the creatures of their age, And if it be asked why that age encouraged immorality which no other age would have tolerated, we have no hesitation in answering that this, great depravation of the national taste was the effect of the prevalence of Puritanism under the Commonwealth. To punish public outrages on morals and religion is unquestionably within the competence of rulers. But when a government, not content with requiring decency, requires sanctity, it oversteps the bounds which mark its proper functions. And it may be laid down as a universal rule that a government which attempts more than it ought will perform less. A lawgiver who, in order to protect distressed borrowers, limits the rate of interest, either makes it impossible for the objects of his care to borrow at all, or places them at the mercy of the worst class of usurers. A lawgiver who, from tenderness for labouring men, fixes the hours of their work and the amount of their wages, is certain to make them far more wretched than he found them. And so a government which, not content with repressing scandalous excesses, demands from its subjects fervent and austere piety, will soon discover that, while attempting to render an impossible service to the cause of virtue, it has in truth only promoted vice. For what are the means by which a government can effect its ends? Two only, reward and punishment; powerful means, indeed, for influencing the exterior act, but altogether impotent for the purpose of touching the heart. A public functionary who is told that he will be promoted if he is a devout Catholic, and turned out of his place if he is not, will probably go to mass every morning, exclude meat from his table on Fridays, shrive himself regularly, and perhaps let his superiors know that he wears a hair shirt next his skin. Under a Puritan government, a person who is apprised that piety is essential to thriving in the world will be strict in the observance of the Sunday, or, as he will call it, Sabbath, and will avoid a theatre as if it were plague- stricken. Such a show of religion as this the hope of gain and the fear of loss will produce, at a week's notice, in any abundance which a government may require. But under this show, sensuality, ambition, avarice, and hatred retain unimpaired power, and the seeming convert has only added to the vices of a man of the world all the still darker vices which are engendered by the constant practice of dissimulation. The truth cannot be long concealed. The public discovers that the grave persons who are proposed to it as patterns are more utterly destitute of moral principle and of moral sensibility than avowed libertines. It sees that these Pharisees are farther removed from real goodness than publicans and harlots. And, as usual, it rushes to the extreme opposite to that which it quits. It considers a high religious profession as a sure mark of meanness and depravity. On the very first day on which the restraint of fear is taken away, and on which men can venture to say what they think, a frightful peal of blasphemy and ribaldry proclaims that the short-sighted policy which aimed at making a nation of saints has made a nation of scoffers. It was thus in France about the beginning of the eighteenth century. Lewis the Fourteenth in his old age became religious: he determined that his subjects should be religious too: he shrugged his shoulders and knitted his brows if he observed at his levee or near his dinner-table any gentleman who neglected the duties enjoined by the Church, and rewarded piety with blue ribands, invitations to Marli, governments, pensions, and regiments. Forthwith Versailles became, in everything but dress, a convent. The pulpits and confessionals were surrounded by swords and embroidery. The Marshals of France were much in prayer; and there was hardly one among the Dukes and Peers who did not carry good little books in his pocket, fast during Lent, and communicate at Easter. Madame de Maintenon, who had a great share in the blessed work, boasted that devotion had become quite the fashion. A fashion indeed it was; and like a fashion it passed away. No sooner had the old king been carried to St. Denis than the whole Court unmasked. Every man hastened to indemnify himself, by the excess of licentiousness and impudence, for years of mortification. The same persons who, a few months before, with meek voices and demure looks, had consulted divines about the state of their souls, now surrounded the midnight table where, amidst the bounding of champagne corks, a drunken prince, enthroned between Dubois and Madame de Parabere, hiccoughed out atheistical arguments and obscene jests. The early part of the reign of Lewis the Fourteenth had been a time of licence; but the most dissolute men of that generation would have blushed at the orgies of the Regency. It was the same with our fathers in the time of the Great Civil War. We are by no means unmindful of the great debt which mankind owes to the Puritans of that time, the deliverers of England, the founders of the American Commonwealths. But in the day of their power, those men committed one great fault, which left deep and lasting traces in the national character and manners. They mistook the end and overrated the force of government. They determined, not merely to protect religion and public morals from insult, an object for which the civil sword, in discreet hands, may be beneficially employed, but to make the people committed to their rule truly devout. Yet, if they had only reflected on events which they had themselves witnessed and in which they had themselves borne a great part, they would have seen what was likely to be the result of their enterprise. They had lived under a government which, during a long course of years, did all that could be done, by lavish bounty and by rigorous punishment, to enforce conformity to the doctrine and discipline of the Church of England. No person suspected of hostility to that Church had the smallest chance of obtaining favour at the Court of Charles. Avowed dissent was punished by imprisonment, by ignominious exposure, by cruel mutilations, and by ruinous fines. And the event had been that the Church had fallen, and had, in its fall, dragged down with it a monarchy which had stood six hundred years. The Puritan might have learned, if from nothing else, yet from his own recent victory, that governments which attempt things beyond their reach are likely not merely to fail, but to produce an effect directly the opposite of that which they contemplate as desirable. All this was overlooked. The saints were to inherit the earth. The theatres were closed. The fine arts were placed under absurd restraints. Vices which had never before been even misdemeanours were made capital felonies. It was solemnly resolved by Parliament "that no person shall be employed but such as the House shall be satisfied of his real godliness." The pious assembly had a Bible lying on the table for reference. If they had consulted it they might have learned that the wheat and the tares grow together inseparably, and must either be spared together or rooted up together. To know whether a man was really godly was impossible. But it was easy to know whether he had a plain dress, lank hair, no starch in his linen, no gay furniture in his house; whether he talked through his nose, and showed the whites of his eyes; whether he named his children Assurance, Tribulation, Mahershalal-hash-baz; whether he avoided Spring Garden when in town, and abstained from hunting and hawking when in the country; whether he expounded hard scriptures to his troop of dragoons, and talked in a committee of ways and means about seeking the Lord. These were tests which could easily be applied. The misfortune was that they were tests which proved nothing. Such as they were, they were employed by the dominant party. And the consequence was that a crowd of impostors, in every walk of life, began to mimic and to caricature what were then regarded as the outward signs of sanctity. The nation was not duped. The restraints of that gloomy time were such as would have been impatiently borne, if imposed by men who were universally believed to be saints. Those restraints became altogether insupportable when they were known to be kept up for the profit of hypocrites. It is quite certain that, even if the royal family had never returned, even if Richard Cromwell or Henry Cromwell had been at the head of the administration, there would have been a great relaxation of manners. Before the Restoration many signs indicated that a period of licence was at hand. The Restoration crushed for a time the Puritan party, and placed supreme power in the hands of a libertine. The political counter-revolution assisted the moral counter-revolution, and was in turn assisted by it. A period of wild and desperate dissoluteness followed. Even in remote manor-houses and hamlets the change was in some degree felt; but in London the outbreak of debauchery was appalling; and in London the places most deeply infected were the Palace, the quarters inhabited by the aristocracy, and the Inns of Court. It was on the support of these parts of the town that the playhouses depended. The character of the drama became conformed to the character of its patrons. The comic poet was the mouthpiece of the most deeply corrupted part of a corrupted society. And in the plays before us we find, distilled and condensed, the essential spirit of the fashionable world during the anti-Puritan reaction. The Puritan had affected formality; the comic poet laughed at decorum. The Puritan had frowned at innocent diversions; the comic poet took under his patronage the most flagitious excesses. The Puritan had canted; the comic poet blasphemed. The Puritan had made an affair of gallantry felony without benefit of clergy; the comic poet represented it as an honourable distinction. The Puritan spoke with disdain of the low standard of popular morality; his life was regulated by a far more rigid code; his virtue was sustained by motives unknown to men of the world. Unhappily it had been amply proved in many cases, and might well be suspected in many more, that these high pretensions were unfounded. Accordingly, the fashionable circles, and the comic poets who were the spokesmen of those circles, took up the notion that all professions of piety and integrity were to be construed by the rule of contrary; that it might well be doubted whether there was such a thing as virtue in the world; but that, at all events, a person who affected to be better than his neighbours was sure to be a knave. In the old drama there had been much that was reprehensible. But whoever compares even the least decorous plays of Fletcher with those contained in the volume before us will see how much the profligacy which follows a period of overstrained austerity goes beyond the profligacy which precedes such a period. The nation resembled the demoniac in the New Testament. The Puritans boasted that the unclean spirit was cast out. The house was empty, swept, and garnished; and for a time the expelled tenant wandered through dry places seeking rest and finding none. But the force of the exorcism was spent. The fiend returned to his abode; and returned not alone. He took to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself. They entered in, and dwelt together: and the second possession was worse than the first. We will now, as far as our limits will permit, pass in review the writers to whom Mr. Leigh Hunt has introduced us. Of the four, Wycherley stands, we think, last in literary merit, but first in order of time, and first, beyond all doubt, in immorality. WILLIAM WYCHERLEY was born in 1640. He was the son of a Shropshire gentleman of old family, and of what was then accounted a good estate: The properly was estimated at six hundred a year, a fortune which, among the fortunes at that time, probably ranked as a fortune of two thousand a year would rank in our days. William was an infant when the civil war broke out; and, while he was still in his rudiments, a Presbyterian hierarchy and a republican government were established on the ruins of the ancient Church and throne. Old Mr. Wycherley was attached to the royal cause, and was not disposed to intrust the education of his heir to the solemn Puritans who now ruled the universities and public schools. Accordingly the young gentleman was sent at fifteen to France. He resided some time in the neighbourhood of the Duke of Montausier, chief of one of the noblest families of Touraine. The Duke's wife, a daughter of the house of Rambouillet, was a finished specimen of those talents and accomplishments for which her race was celebrated. The young foreigner was introduced to the splendid circle which surrounded the Duchess, and there he appears to have learned some good and some evil. In a few years he returned to his country a fine gentleman and a Papist. His conversion, it may safely be affirmed, was the effect not of any strong impression on his understanding, or feelings, but partly of intercourse with an agreeable society in which the Church of Rome was the fashion, and partly of that aversion to Calvinistic austerities which was then almost universal among young Englishmen of parts and spirit, and which, at one time, seemed likely to make one half of them Catholics, and the other half Atheists. But the Restoration came. The universities were again in loyal hands; and there was reason to hope that there would be again a national Church fit for a gentleman. Wycherley became a member of Queen's College, Oxford, and abjured the errors of the Church of Rome. The somewhat equivocal glory of turning, for a short time, a good-for-nothing Papist into a good-for-nothing Protestant is ascribed to Bishop Barlow. Wycherley left Oxford without taking a degree, and entered at the Temple, where he lived gaily for some years, observing the humours of the town, enjoying its pleasures, and picking up just as much law as was necessary to make the character of a pettifogging attorney or of a litigious client entertaining in a comedy. From an early age he had been in the habit of amusing himself by writing. Some wretched lines of his on the Restoration are still extant. Had he devoted himself to the making of verses, he would have been nearly as far below Tate and Blackmore as Tate and Blackmore are below Dryden. His only chance for renown would have been that he might have occupied a niche in a satire, between Flecknoe and Settle. There was, however, another kind of composition in which his talents and acquirements qualified him to succeed; and to that he judiciousily betook himself. In his old age he used to say that he wrote Love in a Wood at nineteen, the Gentleman Dancing-Master at twenty-one, the Plain Dealer at twenty-five, and the Country Wife at one or two and thirty. We are incredulous, we own, as to the truth of this story. Nothing that we know of Wycherley leads us to think him incapable of sacrificing truth to vanity. And his memory in the decline of his life played him such strange tricks that we might question the correctness of his assertion without throwing any imputation on his veracity. It is certain that none of his plays was acted till 1672, when he gave Love in a Wood to the public. It seems improbable that he should resolve, on so important an occasion as that of a first appearance before the world, to run his chance with a feeble piece, written before his talents were ripe, before his style was formed, before he had looked abroad into the world; and this when he had actually in his desk two highly-finished plays, the fruit of his matured powers. When we look minutely at the pieces themselves, we find in every part of them reason to suspect the accuracy of Wycherley's statement. In the first scene of Love in a Wood, to go no further, we find many passages which he could not have written when he was nineteen. There is an allusion to gentlemen's periwigs, which first came into fashion in 1663; an allusion to guineas, which were first struck in 1663; an allusion to the vests which Charles ordered to be worn at Court in 1666; an allusion to the fire of 1666; and several political allusions which must be assigned to times later than the year of the Restoration, to times when the Government and the city were opposed to each other, and when the Presbyterian ministers had been driven from the parish churches to the conventicles. But it is needless to dwell on particular expressions. The whole air and spirit of the piece belong to a period subsequent to that mentioned by Wycherley. As to the Plain Dealer, which is said to have been written when he was twenty- five, it contains one scene unquestionably written after 1675, several which are later than 1668, and scarcely a line which can have been composed before the end of 1666. Whatever may have been the age at which Wycherley composed his plays, it is certain that he did not bring them before the public till he was upwards of thirty. In 1672, Love in a Wood was acted with more success than it deserved, and this event produced a great change in the fortunes of the author. The Duchess of Cleveland cast her eyes upon him, and was pleased with his appearance. This abandoned woman, not content with her complaisant husband and her royal keeper, lavished her fondness on a crowd of paramours of all ranks, from dukes to rope-dancers. In the time of the commonwealth she commenced her career of gallantry, and terminated it under Anne, by marrying, when a great-grandmother, that worthless fop, Beau Fielding. It is not strange that she should have regarded Wycherley with favour. His figure was commanding, his countenance strikingly handsome, his look and deportment full of grace and dignity. He had, as Pope said long after, "the true nobleman look," the look which seems to indicate superiority, and a not unbecoming consciousness of superiority. His hair indeed, as he says in one of his poems, was prematurely grey. But in that age of periwigs this misfortune was of little importance. The Duchess admired him, and proceeded to make love to him, after the fashion of the coarse-minded and shameless circle to which she belonged. In the Ring, when the crowd of beauties and fine gentlemen was thickest, she put her head out of her coach-window, and bawled to him, "Sir, you are a rascal; you are a villain"; and, if she is not belied, she added another phrase of abuse which we will not quote, but of which we may say that it might most justly have been applied to her own children. Wycherley called on her Grace the next day, and with great humility begged to know in what way he had been so unfortunate as to disoblige her. Thus began an intimacy from which the poet probably expected wealth and honours. Nor were such expectations unreasonable. A handsome young fellow about the Court, known by the name of Jack Churchill, was, about the same time, so lucky as to become the object of a short-lived fancy of the Duchess. She had presented him with five thousand pounds, the price, in all probability, of some title or pardon. The prudent youth had lent the money on high interest and on landed security; and this judicious investment was the beginning of the most splendid private fortune in Europe. Wycherley was not so lucky. The partiality with which the great lady regarded him was indeed the talk of the whole town; and sixty years later old men who remembered those days told Voltaire that she often stole from the Court to her lover's chambers in the Temple, disguised like a country girl, with a straw hat on her head, pattens on her feet, and a basket in her hand. The poet was indeed too happy and proud to be discreet. He dedicated to the Duchess the play which had led to their acquaintance, and in the dedication expressed himself in terms which could not but confirm the reports which had gone abroad. But at Whitehall such an affair was regarded in no serious light. The lady was not afraid to bring Wycherley to Court, and to introduce him to a splendid society, with which, as far as appears, he had never before mixed. The easy King, who allowed to his mistresses the same liberty which he claimed for himself, was pleased with the conversation and manners of his new rival. So high did Wycherley stand in the royal favour that once, when he was confined by a fever to his lodgings in Bow Street, Charles, who, with all his faults, was certainly a man of social and affable disposition, called on him, sat by his bed, advised him to try change of air, and gave him a handsome sum of money to defray the expense of the journey. Buckingham, then Master of the Horse, and one of that infamous ministry known by the name of the Cabal, had been one of the Duchess's innumerable paramours. He at first showed some symptoms of jealousy, but he soon, after his fashion, veered round from anger to fondness, and gave Wycherley a commission in his own regiment and a place in the royal household. It would be unjust to Wycherley's memory not to mention here the only good action, as far as we know, of his whole life. He is said to have made great exertions to obtain the patronage of Buckingham for the illustrious author of Hudibras, who was now sinking into an obscure grave, neglected by a nation proud of his genius, and by a Court which he had served too well. His Grace consented to see poor Butler; and an appointment was made. But unhappily two pretty women passed by; the volatile Duke ran after them; the opportunity was lost, and could never be regained. The second Dutch war, the most disgraceful war in the whole history of England, was now raging. It was not in that age considered as by any means necessary that a naval officer should receive a professional education. Young men of rank, who were hardly able to keep their feet in a breeze, served on board the King's ships, sometimes with commissions, and sometimes as volunteers. Mulgrave, Dorset, Rochester, and many others, left the playhouses in the Mall for hammocks and salt pork, and, ignorant as they were of the rudiments of naval service, showed, at least, on the day of battle, the courage which is seldom wanting in an English gentleman. All good judges of maritime affairs complained that, under this system, the ships were grossly mismanaged, and that the tarpaulins contracted the vices, without acquiring the graces, of the Court. But on this subject, as on every other where the interests or whims of favourites were concerned, the Government of Charles was deaf to all remonstrances. Wycherley did not choose to be out of the fashion. He embarked, was present at a battle, and celebrated it, on his return, in a copy of verses too bad for the bellman. [Mr. Leigh Hunt supposes that the battle at which Wycherley was present was that which the Duke of York gained over Opdam, in 1665. We believe that it was one of the battles between Rupert and De Ruyter, in 1673. The point is of no importance; and there cannot be said to be much evidence either way. We offer, however, to Mr. Leigh Hunt's consideration three arguments, of no great weight certainly, yet such as ought, we think, to prevail in the absence of better. First, it is not very likely that a young Templar, quite unknown in the world,--and Wycherley was such in 1665,--should have quitted his chambers to go to sea. On the other hand, it would be in the regular course of things, that, when a courtier and an equerry, he should offer his services. Secondly, his verses appear to have been written after a drawn battle, like those of 1673, and not after a complete victory, like that of 1665. Thirdly, in the epilogue to the Gentleman Dancing-Master, written in 1673, he says that "all gentlemen must pack to sea"; an expression which makes it probable that he did not himself mean to stay behind.] About the same time, he brought on the stage his second piece, the Gentleman Dancing-Master. The biographers say nothing, as far as we remember, about the fate of this play. There is, however, reason to believe that, though certainly far superior to Love in a Wood, it was not equally successful. It was first tried at the west end of the town, and, as the poet confessed, "would scarce do there." It was then performed in Salisbury Court, but, as it should seem, with no better event. For, in the prologue to the Country Wife, Wycherley described himself as "the late so baffled scribbler." In 1675, the Country Wife was performed with brilliant success, which, in a literary point of view, was not wholly unmerited. For, though one of the most profligate and heartless of human compositions, it is the elaborate production of a mind, not indeed rich, original, or imaginative, but ingenious, observant, quick to seize hints, and patient of the toil of polishing. The Plain Dealer, equally immoral and equally well written, appeared in 1677. At first this piece pleased the people less than the critics; but after a time its unquestionable merits and the zealous support of Lord Dorset, whose influence in literary and fashionable society was unbounded, established it in the public favour. The fortune of Wycherley was now in the zenith, and began to decline. A long life was still before him. But it was destined to be filled with nothing but shame and wretchedness, domestic dissensions, literary failures, and pecuniary embarrassments. The King, who was looking about for an accomplished man to conduct the education of his natural son, the young Duke of Richmond, at length fixed on Wycherley. The poet, exulting in his good luck, went down to amuse himself at Tunbridge Wells, looked into a bookseller's shop on the Pantiles, and, to his great delight, heard a handsome woman ask for the Plain Dealer, which had just been published. He made acquaintance with the lady, who proved to be the Countess of Drogheda, a gay young widow, with an ample jointure. She was charmed with his person and his wit, and, after a short flirtation, agreed to become his wife. Wycherley seems to have been apprehensive that this connection might not suit well with the King's plans respecting the Duke of Richmond. He accordingly prevailed on the lady to consent to a private marriage. All came out. Charles thought the conduct of Wycherley both disrespectful and disingenuous. Other causes probably assisted to alienate the sovereign from the subject who had lately been so highly favoured. Buckingham was now in opposition, and had been committed to the Tower; not, as Mr. Leigh Hunt supposes, on a charge of treason, but by an order of the House of Lords for some expressions which he had used in debate. Wycherley wrote some bad lines in praise of his imprisoned patron, which, if they came to the knowledge of the King, would certainly have made his majesty very angry. The favour of the Court was completely withdrawn from the poet. An amiable woman with a large fortune might indeed have been an ample compensation for the loss. But Lady Drogheda was ill-tempered, imperious, and extravagantly jealous. She had herself been a maid of honour at Whitehall. She well knew in what estimation conjugal fidelity was held among the fine gentlemen there, and watched her town husband as assiduously as Mr. Pinchwife watched his country wife. The unfortunate wit was, indeed, allowed to meet his friends at a tavern opposite to his own house. But on such occasions the windows were always open, in order that her Ladyship, who was posted on the other side of the street, might be satisfied that no woman was of the party. The death of Lady Drogheda released the poet from this distress; but a series of disasters, in rapid succession, broke down his health, his spirits, and his fortune. His wife meant to leave him a good property, and left him only a lawsuit. His father could not or would not assist him. Wycherley was at length thrown into the Fleet, and languished there during seven years, utterly forgotten, as it should seem, by the gay and lively circle of which he had been a distinguished ornament. In the extremity of his distress he implored the publisher who had been enriched by the sale of his works, to lend him twenty pounds, and was refused. His comedies, however, still kept possession of the stage, and drew great audiences, which troubled themselves little about the situation of the author. At length James the Second, who had now succeeded to the throne, happened to go to the theatre on an evening when the Plain Dealer was acted. He was pleased by the performance, and touched by the fate of the writer, whom he probably remembered as one of the gayest and handsomest of his brother's courtiers. The King determined to pay Wycherley's debts, and to settle on the unfortunate poet a pension of two hundred pounds a year. This munificence on the part of a prince who was little in the habit of rewarding literary merit, and whose whole soul was devoted to the interests of his Church, raises in us a surmise which Mr. Leigh Hunt will, we fear, pronounce very uncharitable. We cannot help suspecting that it was at this time that Wycherley returned to the communion of the Church of Rome. That he did return to the communion of the Church of Rome is certain. The date of his reconversion, as far as we know, has never been mentioned by any biographer. We believe that, if we place it at this time, we do no injustice to the character either of Wycherley or James. Not long after, old Mr. Wycherley died; and his son, now past the middle of life, came to the family estate. Still, however, he was not at his ease. His embarrassments were great: his property was strictly tied up; and he was on very bad terms with the heir-at- law. He appears to have led, during a long course of years, that most wretched life, the life of a vicious old boy about town. Expensive tastes with little money, and licentious appetites with declining vigour, were the just penance for his early irregularities. A severe illness had produced a singular effect on his intellect. His memory played him pranks stranger than almost any that are to be found in the history of that strange faculty. It seemed to be at once preternaturally strong and preternaturally weak. If a book was read to him before he went to bed, he would wake the next morning with his mind full of the thoughts and expressions which he had heard over night; and he would write them down, without in the least suspecting that they were not his own. In his verses the same ideas, and even the same words, came over and over again several times in a short composition. His fine person bore the marks of age, sickness, and sorrow; and he mourned for his departed beauty with an effeminate regret. He could not look without a sigh at the portrait which Lely had painted of him when he was only twenty-eight, and often murmured, Quantum mutatus ab illo. He was still nervously anxious about his literary reputation, and, not content with the fame which he still possessed as a dramatist, was determined to be renowned as a satirist and an amatory poet. In 1704, after twenty-seven years of silence, he again appeared as an author. He put forth a large folio of miscellaneous verses, which, we believe, has never been reprinted. Some of these pieces had probably circulated through the town in manuscript. For, before the volume appeared, the critics at the coffee-houses very confidently predicted that it would be utterly worthless, and were in consequence bitterly reviled by the poet in an ill- written, foolish, and egotistical preface. The book amply vindicated the most unfavourable prophecies that had been hazarded. The style and versification are beneath criticism; the morals are those of Rochester. For Rochester, indeed, there was some excuse. When his offences against decorum were committed, he was a very young man, misled by a prevailing fashion. Wycherley was sixty-four. He had long outlived the times when libertinism was regarded as essential to the character of a wit and a gentleman. Most of the rising poets, Addison, for example, John Philips and Rowe, were studious of decency. We can hardly conceive any thing more miserable than the figure which the ribald old man makes in the midst of so many sober and well- conducted youths. In the very year in which this bulky volume of obscene doggerel was published, Wycherley formed an acquaintance of a very singular kind. A little, pale, crooked, sickly, bright-eyed urchin, just turned of sixteen, had written some copies of verses in which discerning judges could detect the promise of future eminence. There was, indeed, as yet nothing very striking or original in the conceptions of the young poet. But he was already skilled in the art of metrical composition. His diction and his music were not those of the great old masters; but that which his ablest contemporaries were labouring to do, he already did best. His style was not richly poetical; but it was always neat, compact, and pointed. His verse wanted variety of pause, of swell, and of cadence, but never grated harshly on the ear, or disappointed it by a feeble close. The youth was already free of the company of wits, and was greatly elated at being introduced to the author of the Plain Dealer and the Country Wife. It is curious to trace the history of the intercourse which took place between Wycherley and Pope, between the representative of the age that was going out, and the representative of the age that was coming in, between the friend of Rochester and Buckingham, and the friend of Lyttelton and Mansfield. At first the boy was enchanted by the kindness and condescension of so eminent a writer, haunted his door, and followed him about like a spaniel from coffee-house to coffee-house. Letters full of affection, humility, and fulsome flattery were interchanged between the friends, But the first ardour of affection could not last. Pope, though at no time scrupulously delicate in his writings or fastidious as to the morals of his associates, was shocked by the indecency of a rake who, at seventy, was still the representative of the monstrous profligacy of the Restoration. As the youth grew older, as his mind expanded and his fame rose, he appreciated both himself and Wycherley more correctly. He felt a just contempt for the old gentleman's verses, and was at no great pains to conceal his opinion. Wycherley, on the other hand, though blinded by self-love to the imperfections of what he called his poetry, could not but see that there was an immense difference between his young companion's rhymes and his own. He was divided between two feelings. He wished to have the assistance of so skilful a hand to polish his lines; and yet he shrank from the humiliation of being beholden for literary assistance to a lad who might have been his grandson. Pope was willing to give assistance, but was by no means disposed to give assistance and flattery too. He took the trouble to retouch whole reams of feeble stumbling verses, and inserted many vigorous lines which the least skilful reader will distinguish in an instant. But he thought that by these services he acquired a right to express himself in terms which would not, under ordinary circumstances, become one who was addressing a man of four times his age. In one letter he tells Wycherley that "the worst pieces are such as, to render them very good, would require almost the entire new writing of them." In another, he gives the following account of his corrections: "Though the whole be as short again as at first, there is not one thought omitted but what is a repetition of something in your first volume, or in this very paper; and the versification throughout is, I believe, such as nobody can be shocked at. The repeated permission you gave me of dealing freely with you, will, I hope, excuse what I have done; for, if I had not spared you when I thought severity would do you a kindness, I have not mangled you where I thought there was no absolute need of amputation." Wycherley continued to return thanks for all this hacking and hewing, which was, indeed, of inestimable service to his compositions. But at last his thanks began to sound very like reproaches. In private, he is said to have described Pope as a person who could not cut out a suit, but who had some skill in turning old coats. In his letters to Pope, while he acknowledged that the versification of the poems had been greatly improved, he spoke of the whole art of versification with scorn, and sneered at those who preferred sound to sense. Pope revenged himself for this outbreak of spleen by return of post. He had in his hands a volume of Wycherley's rhymes, and he wrote to say that this volume was so full of faults that he could not correct it without completely defacing the manuscript. "I am," he said, "equally afraid of sparing you, and of offending you by too impudent a correction." This was more than flesh and blood could bear. Wycherley reclaimed his papers, in a letter in which resentment shows itself plainly through the thin disguise of civility. Pope, glad to be rid of a troublesome and inglorious task, sent back the deposit, and, by way of a parting courtesy, advised the old man to turn his poetry into prose, and assured him that the public would like his thoughts much better without his versification, Thus ended this memorable correspondence. Wycherley lived some years after the termination of the strange friendship which we have described. The last scene of his life was, perhaps, the most scandalous. Ten days before his death, at seventy-five, he married a young girl, merely in order to injure his nephew, an act which proves that neither years, nor adversity, nor what he called his philosophy, nor either of the religions which he had at different times professed, had taught him the rudiments of morality. He died in December 1715, and lies in the vault under the church of St. Paul in Covent Garden. His bride soon after married a Captain Shrimpton, who thus became possessed of a large collection of manuscripts. These were sold to a bookseller. They were so full of erasures and interlineations that no printer could decipher them. It was necessary to call in the aid of a professed critic; and Theobald, the editor of Shakspeare, and the hero of the first Dunciad, was employed to ascertain the true reading. In this way a volume of miscellanies in verse and prose was got up for the market. The collection derives all its value from the traces of Pope's hand, which are everywhere discernible. Of the moral character of Wycherley it can hardly be necessary for us to say more. His fame as a writer rests wholly on his comedies, and chiefly on the last two. Even as a comic writer, he was neither of the best school, nor highest in his school. He was in truth a worse Congreve. His chief merit, like Congreve's, lies in the style of his dialogue, but the wit which lights up the Plain Dealer and the Country Wife is pale and flickering, when compared with the gorgeous blaze which dazzles us almost to blindness in Love for Love and the Way of the World. Like Congreve, and, indeed, even more than Congreve, Wycherley is ready to sacrifice dramatic propriety to the liveliness of his dialogue. The poet speaks out of the mouths of all his dunces and coxcombs, and makes them describe themselves with a good sense and acuteness which puts them on a level with the wits and heroes. We will give two instances, the first which occur to us, from the Country Wife. There are in the world fools who find the society of old friends insipid, and who are always running after new companions. Such a character is a fair subject for comedy. But nothing can be more absurd than to introduce a man of this sort saying to his comrade, "I can deny you nothing: for though I have known thee a great while, never go if I do not love thee as well as a new acquaintance." That town-wits, again, have always been rather a heartless class, is true. But none of them, we will answer for it, ever said to a young lady to whom he was making love, "We wits rail and make love often, but to show our parts: as we have no affections, so we have no malice." Wycherley's plays are said to have been the produce of long and patient labour. The epithet of "slow" was early given to him by Rochester, and was frequently repeated. In truth his mind, unless we are greatly mistaken, was naturally a very meagre soil, and was forced only by great labour and outlay to bear fruit which, after all, was not of the highest flavour. He has scarcely more claim to originality than Terence. It is not too much to say that there is hardly anything of the least value in his plays of which the hint is not to be found elsewhere. The best scenes in the Gentleman Dancing-Master were suggested by Calderon's Maestro de Danzar, not by any means one of the happiest comedies of the great Castilian poet. The Country Wife is borrowed from the Ecole des Maris and the Ecole des Femmes. The groundwork of the Plain Dealer is taken from the Misanthrope of Moliere. One whole scene is almost translated from the Critique de l'Ecole des Femmes. Fidelia is Shakspeare's Viola stolen, and marred in the stealing; and the Widow Blackacre, beyond comparison Wycherley's best comic character, is the Countess in Racine's Plaideurs, talking the jargon of English instead of that of French chicane. The only thing original about Wycherley, the only thing which he could furnish from his own mind in inexhaustible abundance, was profligacy. It is curious to observe how everything that he touched, however pure and noble, took in an instant the colour of his own mind. Compare the Ecole des Femmes with the Country Wife. Agnes is a simple and amiable girl, whose heart is indeed full of love, but of love sanctioned by honour, morality, and religion. Her natural talents are great. They have been hidden, and, as it might appear, destroyed by an education elaborately bad. But they are called forth into full energy by a virtuous passion. Her lover, while he adores her beauty, is too honest a man to abuse the confiding tenderness of a creature so charming and inexperienced. Wycherley takes this plot into his hands; and forthwith this sweet and graceful courtship becomes a licentious intrigue of the lowest and least sentimental kind, between an impudent London rake and the idiot wife of a country squire. We will not go into details. In truth, Wycherley's indecency is protected against the critics as a skunk is protected against the hunters. It is safe, because it is too filthy to handle and too noisome even to approach. It is the same with the Plain Dealer. How careful has Shakspeare been in Twelfth Night to preserve the dignity and delicacy of Viola under her disguise! Even when wearing a page's doublet and hose, she is never mixed up with any transaction which the most fastidious mind could regard as leaving a stain on her. She is employed by the Duke on an embassy of love to Olivia, but on an embassy of the most honourable kind. Wycherley borrows Viola; and Viola forthwith becomes a pandar of the basest sort. But the character of Manly is the best illustration of our meaning. Moliere exhibited in his misanthrope a pure and noble mind, which had been sorely vexed by the sight of perfidy and malevolence, disguised under the forms of politeness. As every extreme naturally generates its contrary, Alceste adopts a standard of good and evil directly opposed to that of the society which surrounds him. Courtesy seems to him a vice; and those stern virtues which are neglected by the fops and coquettes of Paris become too exclusively the objects of his veneration. He is often to blame; he is often ridiculous; but he is always a good man; and the feeling which he inspires is regret that a person so estimable should be so unamiable. Wycherley borrowed Alceste, and turned him,--we quote the words of so lenient a critic as Mr. Leigh Hunt,--into "a ferocious sensualist, who believed himself as great a rascal as he thought everybody else." The surliness of Moliere's hero is copied and caricatured. But the most nauseous libertinism and the most dastardly fraud are substituted for the purity and integrity of the original. And, to make the whole complete, Wycherley does not seem to have been aware that he was not drawing the portrait of an eminently honest man. So depraved was his moral taste that, while he firmly believed that he was producing a picture of virtue too exalted for the commerce of this world, he was really delineating the greatest rascal that is to be found, even in his own writings. We pass a very severe censure on Wycherley, when we say that it is a relief to turn from him to Congreve. Congreve's writings, indeed, are by no means pure; nor was he, as far as we are able to judge, a warm-hearted or high-minded man. Yet, in coming to him, we feel that the worst is over, that we are one remove further from the Restoration, that we are past the Nadir of national taste and morality. WILLIAM CONGREVE was born in 1670, at Bardsey, in the neighbourhood of Leeds. His father, a younger son of a very ancient Staffordshire family, had distinguished himself among the cavaliers in the civil war, was set down after the Restoration for the Order of the Royal Oak, and subsequently settled in Ireland, under the patronage of the Earl of Burlington. Congreve passed his childhood and youth in Ireland. He was sent to school at Kilkenny, and thence went to the University of Dublin. His learning does great honour to his instructors. From his writings it appears, not only that he was well acquainted with Latin literature, but that his knowledge of the Greek poets was such as was not, in his time, common even in a college. When he had completed his academical studies, he was sent to London to study the law, and was entered of the Middle Temple. He troubled himself, however, very little about pleading or conveyancing, and gave himself up to literature and society. Two kinds of ambition early took possession of his mind, and often pulled it in opposite directions. He was conscious of great fertility of thought and power of ingenious combination. His lively conversation, his polished manners, and his highly respectable connections, had obtained for him ready access to the best company. He longed to be a great writer. He longed to be a man of fashion. Either object was within his reach. But could he secure both? Was there not something vulgar in letters, something inconsistent with the easy apathetic graces of a man of the mode? Was it aristocratical to be confounded with creatures who lived in the cock lofts of Grub Street, to bargain with publishers, to hurry printers' devils and be hurried by them, to squabble with managers, to be applauded or hissed by pit, boxes, and galleries? Could he forego the renown of being the first wit of his age? Could he attain that renown without sullying what he valued quite as much, his character for gentility? The history of his life is the history of a conflict between these two impulses. In his youth the desire of literary fame had the mastery; but soon the meaner ambition overpowered the higher, and obtained supreme dominion over his mind. His first work, a novel of no great value, he published under the assumed name of Cleophil. His second was the Old Bachelor, acted in 1693, a play inferior indeed to his other comedies, but, in its own line, inferior to them alone. The plot is equally destitute of interest and of probability. The characters are either not distinguishable, or are distinguished only by peculiarities of the most glaring kind. But the dialogue is resplendent with wit and eloquence, which indeed are so abundant that the fool comes in for an ample share, and yet preserves a certain colloquial air, a certain indescribable ease of which Wycherley had given no example, and which Sheridan in vain attempted to imitate. The author, divided between pride and shame, pride at having written a good play, and shame at having done an ungentlemanlike thing, pretended that he had merely scribbled a few scenes for his own amusement, and affected to yield unwillingly to the importunities of those who pressed him to try his fortune on the stage. The Old Bachelor was seen in manuscript by Dryden, one of whose best qualities was a hearty and generous admiration for the talents of others. He declared that he had never read such a first play, and lent his services to bring it into a form fit for representation. Nothing was wanted to the success of the piece. It was so cast as to bring into play all the comic talent, and to exhibit on the boards in one view all the beauty, which Drury Lane Theatre, then the only theatre in London, could assemble. The result was a complete triumph; and the author was gratified with rewards more substantial than the applauses of the pit. Montagu, then a Lord of the Treasury, immediately gave him a place, and, in a short time, added the reversion of another place of much greater value, which, however, did not become vacant till many years had elapsed. In 1694, Congreve brought out the Double Dealer, a comedy in which all the powers which had produced the Old Bachelor showed themselves, matured by time and improved by exercise. But the audience was shocked by the characters of Maskwell and Lady Touchwood. And, indeed, there is something strangely revolting in the way in which a group that seems to belong to the House of Laius or of Pelops is introduced into the midst of the Brisks, Froths, Carelesses, and Plyants. The play was unfavourably received. Yet, if the praise of distinguished men could compensate an author for the disapprobation of the multitude, Congreve had no reason to repine. Dryden, in one of the most ingenious, magnificent, and pathetic pieces that he ever wrote, extolled the author of the Double Dealer in terms which now appear extravagantly hyperbolical. Till Congreve came forth,--so ran this exquisite flattery,--the superiority of the poets who preceded the civil wars was acknowledged. "Theirs was the giant race before the flood." Since the return of the Royal House, much art and ability had been exerted, but the old masters had been still unrivalled. "Our builders were with want of genius curst, The second temple was not like the first." At length a writer had arisen who, just emerging from boyhood, had surpassed the authors of the Knight of the Burning Pestle and of the Silent Woman, and who had only one rival left to contend with. "Heaven, that but once was prodigal before, To Shakspeare gave as much, she could not give him more." Some lines near the end of the poem are singularly graceful and touching, and sank deep into the heart of Congreve. "Already am I worn with cares and age, And just abandoning the ungrateful stage But you, whom every Muse and Grace adorn, Whom I foresee to better fortune born, Be kind to my remains; and oh, defend Against your judgment your departed friend. Let not the insulting foe my fame pursue, But guard those laurels which descend to you." The crowd, as usual, gradually came over to the opinion of the men of note; and the Double Dealer was before long quite as much admired, though perhaps never so much liked, as the Old Bachelor. In 1695 appeared Love for Love, superior both in wit and in scenic effect to either of the preceding plays. It was performed at a new theatre which Betterton and some other actors, disgusted by the treatment which they had received in Drury Lane, had just opened in a tennis-court near Lincoln's Inn. Scarcely any comedy within the memory of the oldest man had been equally successful. The actors were so elated that they gave Congreve a share in their theatre; and he promised in return to furnish them with a play every year, if his health would permit. Two years passed, however, before he produced the Mourning Bride, a play which, paltry as it is when compared, we do not say, with Lear or Macbeth, but with the best dramas of Massinger and Ford, stands very high among the tragedies of the age in which it was written. To find anything so good we must go twelve years back to Venice Preserved, or six years forward to the Fair Penitent. The noble passage which Johnson, both in writing and in conversation, extolled above any other in the English drama, has suffered greatly in the public estimation from the extravagance of his praise. Had he contented himself with saying that it was finer than anything in the tragedies of Dryden, Otway, Lee, Rowe, Southern, Hughes, and Addison, than anything, in short, that had been written for the stage since the days of Charles the First, he would not have been in the wrong. The success of the Mourning Bride was even greater than that of Love for Love. Congreve was now allowed to be the first tragic as well as the first comic dramatist of his time; and all this at twenty-seven. We believe that no English writer except Lord Byron has, at so early an age, stood so high in the estimation of his contemporaries. At this time took place an event which deserves, in our opinion, a very different sort of notice from that which has been bestowed on it by Mr. Leigh Hunt. The nation had now nearly recovered from the demoralising effect of the Puritan austerity. The gloomy follies of the reign of the Saints were but faintly remembered. The evils produced by profaneness and debauchery were recent and glaring. The Court, since the Revolution, had ceased to patronise licentiousness. Mary was strictly pious; and the vices of the cold, stern, and silent William, were not obtruded on the public eye. Discountenanced by the Government, and failing in the favour of the people, the profligacy of the Restoration still maintained its ground in some parts of society. Its strongholds were the places where men of wit and fashion congregated, and above all, the theatres. At this conjuncture arose a great reformer whom, widely as we differ from him in many important points, we can never mention without respect. JEREMY COLLIER was a clergyman of the Church of England, bred at Cambridge. His talents and attainments were such as might have been expected to raise him to the highest honours of his profession. He had an extensive knowledge of books; yet he had mingled much with polite society, and is said not to have wanted either grace or vivacity in conversation. There were few branches of literature to which he had not paid some attention. But ecclesiastical antiquity was his favourite study. In religious opinions he belonged to that section of the Church of England which lies furthest from Geneva and nearest to Rome. His notions touching Episcopal government, holy orders, the efficacy of the sacraments, the authority of the Fathers, the guilt of schism, the importance of vestments, ceremonies, and solemn days, differed little from those which are now held by Dr. Pusey and Mr. Newman. Towards the close of his life, indeed, Collier took some steps which brought him still nearer to Popery, mixed water with the wine in the Eucharist, made the sign of the cross in confirmation, employed oil in the visitation of the sick, and offered up prayers for the dead. His politics were of a piece with his divinity. He was a Tory of the highest sort, such as in the cant of his age was called a Tantivy. Not even the persecution of the bishops and the spoliation of the universities could shake his steady loyalty. While the Convention was sitting, he wrote with vehemence in defence of the fugitive king, and was in consequence arrested. But his dauntless spirit was not to be so tamed. He refused to take the oaths, renounced all his preferments, and, in a succession of pamphlets written with much violence and with some ability, attempted to excite the nation against its new masters. In 1692, he was again arrested on suspicion of having been concerned in a treasonable plot. So unbending were his principles that his friends could hardly persuade him to let them bail him; and he afterwards expressed his remorse for having been induced thus to acknowledge, by implication, the authority of an usurping government. He was soon in trouble again. Sir John Friend and Sir William Parkins, were tried and convicted of high treason for planning the murder of King William. Collier administered spiritual consolation to them, attended them to Tyburn, and, just before they were turned off, laid his hands on their heads, and by the authority which he derived from Christ, solemnly absolved them. This scene gave indescribable scandal. Tories joined with Whigs in blaming the conduct of the daring priest. Some acts, it was said, which fall under the definition of treason are such that a good man may, in troubled times, be led into them even by his virtues. It may be necessary for the protection of society to punish such a man. But even in punishing him we consider him as legally rather than morally guilty, and hope that his honest error, though it cannot be pardoned here, will not be counted to him for sin hereafter. But such was not the case of Collier's penitents. They were concerned in a plot for waylaying and butchering, in an hour of security, one who, whether he were or were not their king, was at all events their fellow-creature. Whether the Jacobite theory about the rights of governments and the duties of subjects were or were not well founded, assassination must always be considered as a great crime. It is condemned even by the maxims of worldly honour and morality. Much more must it be an object of abhorrence to the pure Spouse of Christ. The Church cannot surely, without the saddest and most mournful forebodings, see one of her children who has been guilty of this great wickedness pass into eternity without any sign of repentance. That these traitors had given any sign of repentance was not alleged. It might be that they had privately declared their contrition; and, if so, the minister of religion might be justified in privately assuring them of the Divine forgiveness. But a public remission ought to have been preceded by a public atonement. The regret of these men, if expressed at all, had been expressed in secret. The hands of Collier had been laid on them in the presence of thousands. The inference which his enemies drew from his conduct was that he did not consider the conspiracy against the life of William as sinful. But this inference he very vehemently, and, we doubt not, very sincerely denied. The storm raged. The bishops put forth a solemn censure Of the absolution. The Attorney-General brought the matter before the Court of King's Bench. Collier had now made up his mind not to give bail for his appearance before any court which derived its authority from the usurper. He accordingly absconded and was outlawed. He survived these events about thirty years. The prosecution was not pressed; and he was soon suffered to resume his literary pursuits in quiet. At a later period, many attempts were made to shake his perverse integrity by offers of wealth and dignity, but in vain. When he died towards the end of the reign of George the First, he still under the ban of the law. We shall not be suspected of regarding either the politics or the theology of Collier with partiality; but we believe him to have been as honest and courageous a man as ever lived. We will go further, and say that, though passionate and often wrong-headed, he was a singularly fair controversialist, candid, generous, too high-spirited to take mean advantages even in the most exciting disputes, and pure from all taint of personal malevolence. It must also be admitted that his opinions on ecclesiastical and political affairs, though in themselves absurd and pernicious, eminently qualified him to be the reformer of our lighter literature. The libertinism of the press and of the stage was, as we have said, the effect of a reaction against the Puritan strictness. Profligacy was, like the oak-leaf of the twenty-ninth of May, the badge of a cavalier and a High Churchman. Decency was associated with conventicles and calves' heads. Grave prelates were too much disposed to wink at the excesses of a body of zealous and able allies who covered Roundheads and Presbyterians with ridicule. If a Whig raised his voice against the impiety and licentiousness of the fashionable writers, his mouth was instantly stopped by the retort: You are one of those who groan at a light quotation from Scripture, and raise estates out of the plunder of the Church, who shudder at a double entendre, and chop off the heads of kings. A Baxter, a Burnet, even a Tillotson, would have done little to purify our literature. But when a man fanatical in the cause of episcopacy and actually under outlawry for his attachment to hereditary right, came forward as the champion of decency, the battle was already half won. In 1698, Collier published his Short View of the Profaneness and Immorality of the English Stage, a book which threw the whole literary world into commotion, but which is now much less read than it deserves. The faults of the work, indeed, are neither few nor small. The dissertations on the Greek and Latin drama do not at all help the argument, and, whatever may have been thought of them by the generation which fancied that Christ Church had refuted Bentley, are such as, in the present day, a scholar of very humble pretensions may venture to pronounce boyish, or rather babyish. The censures are not sufficiently discriminating. The authors whom Collier accused had been guilty of such gross sins against decency that he was certain to weaken instead of strengthening his case, by introducing into his charge against them any matter about which there could be the smallest dispute. He was, however, so injudicious as to place among the outrageous offences which he justly arraigned, some things which are really quite innocent, and some slight instances of levity which, though not perhaps strictly correct, could easily be paralleled from the works of writers who had rendered great services to morality and religion. Thus he blames Congreve, the number and gravity of whose real transgressions made it quite unnecessary to tax him with any that were not real, for using the words "martyr" and "inspiration" in a light sense; as if an archbishop might not say that a speech was inspired by claret or that an alderman was a martyr to the gout. Sometimes, again, Collier does not sufficiently distinguish between the dramatist and the persons of the drama. Thus he blames Vanbrugh for putting into Lord Foppington's mouth some contemptuous expressions respecting the Church service; though it is obvious that Vanbrugh could not better express reverence than by making Lord Foppington express contempt. There is also throughout the Short View too strong a display of professional feeling. Collier is not content with claiming for his order an immunity from indiscriminate scurrility; he will not allow that, in any case, any word or act of a divine can be a proper subject for ridicule. Nor does he confine this benefit of clergy to the ministers of the Established Church. He extends the privilege to Catholic priests, and, what in him is more surprising, to Dissenting preachers. This, however, is a mere trifle. Imaums, Brahmins, priests of Jupiter, priests of Baal, are all to be held sacred. Dryden is blamed for making the Mufti in Don Sebastian talk nonsense. Lee is called to a severe account for his incivility to Tiresias. But the most curious passage is that in which Collier resents some uncivil reflections thrown by Cassandra, in Dryden's Cleomenes, on the calf Apis and his hierophants. The words "grass-eating, foddered god," words which really are much in the style of several passages in the Old Testament, give as much offence to this Christian divine as they could have given to the priests of Memphis. But, when all deductions have been made, great merit must be allowed to this work. There is hardly any book of that time from which it would be possible to select specimens of writing so excellent and so various. To compare Collier with Pascal would indeed be absurd. Yet we hardly know where, except in the Provincial Letters, we can find mirth so harmoniously and becomingly blended with solemnity as in the Short View, In truth, all the modes of ridicule, from broad fun to polished and antithetical sarcasm, were at Collier's command. On the other hand, he was complete master of the rhetoric of honest indignation. We scarcely know any volume which contains so many bursts of that peculiar eloquence which comes from the heart and goes to the heart. Indeed the spirit of the book is truly heroic. In order fairly to appreciate it, we must remember the situation in which the writer stood. He was under the frown of power. His name was already a mark for the invectives of one half of the writers of the age, when, in the cause of good taste, good sense, and good morals, he gave battle to the other half. Strong as his political prejudices were, he seems on this occasion to have entirely laid them aside. He has forgotten that he is a Jacobite, and remembers only that he is a citizen and a Christian. Some of his sharpest censures are directed against poetry which had been hailed with delight by the Tory party, and had inflicted a deep wound on the Whigs. It is inspiriting to see how gallantly the solitary outlaw advances to attack enemies, formidable separately, and, it might have been thought, irresistible when combined, distributes his swashing blows right and left among Wycherley, Congreve, and Vanbrugh, treads the wretched D'Urfey down in the dirt beneath his feet, and strikes with all his strength full at the towering crest of Dryden. The effect produced by the Short View was immense. The nation was on the side of Collier. But it could not be doubted that, in the great host which he had defied, some champion would be found to lift the gauntlet. The general belief was that Dryden would take the field; and all the wits anticipated a sharp contest between two well-paired combatants. The great poet had been singled out in the most marked manner. It was well known that he was deeply hurt, that much smaller provocations had formerly roused him to violent resentment, and that there was no literary weapon, offensive or defensive, of which he was not master. But his conscience smote him; he stood abashed, like the fallen archangel at the rebuke of Zephon,-- "And felt how awful goodness is, and saw Virtue in her shape how lovely; saw and pined His loss." At a later period he mentioned the Short View in the preface to his Fables. He complained, with some asperity, of the harshness with which he had been treated, and urged some matters in mitigation. But, on the whole, he frankly acknowledged that he had been justly reproved. "If," said he, "Mr. Collier be my enemy, let him triumph. If he be my friend, as I have given him no personal occasion to be otherwise, he will be glad of my repentance." It would have been wise in Congreve to follow his master's example. He was precisely in that situation in which it is madness to attempt a vindication; for his guilt was so clear, that no address or eloquence could obtain an acquittal. On the other hand, there were in his case many extenuating circumstances which, if he had acknowledged his error and promised amendment, would have procured his pardon. The most rigid censor could not but make great allowances for the faults into which so young a man had been seduced by evil example, by the luxuriance of a vigorous fancy, and by the inebriating effect of popular applause. The esteem, as well as the admiration, of the public was still within his reach. He might easily have effaced all memory of his transgressions, and have shared with Addison the glory of showing that the most brilliant wit may be the ally of virtue. But, in any case, prudence should have restrained him from encountering Collier. The nonjuror was a man thoroughly fitted by nature, education, and habit, for polemical dispute. Congreve's mind, though a mind of no common fertility and vigour, was of a different class. No man understood so well the art of polishing epigrams and repartees into the clearest effulgence, and setting them neatly in easy and familiar dialogue. In this sort of jewellery he attained to a mastery unprecedented and inimitable. But he was altogether rude in the art of controversy; and he had a cause to defend which scarcely any art could have rendered victorious. The event was such as might have been foreseen. Congreve's answer was a complete failure. He was angry, obscure, and dull. Even the Green Room and Will's Coffee-House were compelled to acknowledge that in wit, as well as in argument, the parson had a decided advantage over the poet. Not only was Congreve unable to make any show of a case where he was in the wrong; but he succeeded in putting himself completely in the wrong where he was in the right. Collier had taxed him with profaneness for calling a clergyman Mr. Prig, and for introducing a coachman named Jehu, in allusion to the King of Israel, who was known at a distance by his furious driving. Had there been nothing worse in the Old Bachelor and Double Dealer, Congreve might pass for as pure a writer as Cowper himself, who, in poems revised by so austere a censor as John Newton, calls a fox-hunting squire Nimrod, and gives to a chaplain the disrespectful name of Smug. Congreve might with good effect have appealed to the public whether it might not be fairly presumed that, when such frivolous charges were made, there were no very serious charges to make. Instead of doing this, he pretended that he meant no allusion to the Bible by the name of Jehu, and no reflection by the name of Prig. Strange, that a man of such parts should, in order to defend himself against imputations which nobody could regard as important, tell untruths which it was certain that nobody would believe! One of the pleas which Congreve set up for himself and his brethren was that, though they might be guilty of a little levity here and there, they were careful to inculcate a moral, packed close into two or three lines, at the end of every play. Had the fact been as he stated it, the defence would be worth very little. For no man acquainted with human nature could think that a sententious couplet would undo all the mischief that five profligate acts had done. But it would have been wise in Congreve to have looked again at his own comedies before he used this argument. Collier did so; and found that the moral of the Old Bachelor, the grave apophthegm which is to be a set-off against all the libertinism of the piece is contained in the following triplet: "What rugged ways attend the noon of life! Our sun declines, and with what anxious strife, What pain, we tug that galling load--a wife." "Love for Love," says Collier, "may have a somewhat better farewell, but it would do a man little service should he remember it to his dying day": "The miracle to-day is, that we find A lover true, not that a woman's kind." Collier's reply was severe and triumphant. One of his repartees we will quote, not as a favourable specimen of his manner, but because it was called forth by Congreve's characteristic affectation. The poet spoke of the Old Bachelor as a trifle to which he attached no value, and which had become public by a sort of accident, "I wrote it," he said," to amuse myself in a slow recovery from a fit of sickness." "What his disease was," replied Collier, "I am not to inquire, but it must be a very ill one to be worse than the remedy." All that Congreve gained by coming forward on this occasion, was that he completely deprived himself of the excuse which he might with justice have pleaded for his early offences. "Why," asked Collier, "should the man laugh at the mischief of the boy, and make the disorders of his nonage his own, by an after approbation?" Congreve was not Collier's only opponent. Vanbrugh, Dennis, and Settle took the field. And from a passage in a contemporary satire, we are inclined to think that among the answers to the Short View was one written, or supposed to be written, by Wycherley. The victory remained with Collier. A great and rapid reform in almost all the departments of our lighter literature was the effect of his labours. A new race of wits and poets arose, who generally treated with reverence the great ties which bind society together, and whose very indecencies were decent when compared with those of the school which flourished during the last forty years of the seventeenth century. This controversy probably prevented Congreve from fulfilling the engagements into which he had entered with the actors. It was not till 1700 that he produced the Way of the World, the most deeply meditated and the most brilliantly written of all his works. It wants, perhaps, the constant movement, the effervescence of animal spirits, which we find in love for Love. But the hysterical rants of Lady Wishfort, the meeting of Witwould and his brother, the country knight's courtship and his subsequent revel, and, above all, the chase and surrender of Millamant, are superior to anything that is to be found in the whole range of English comedy from the civil war downwards. It is quite inexplicable to us that this play should have failed on the stage. Yet so it was; and the author, already sore with the wounds which Collier had inflicted, was galled past endurance by this new stroke. He resolved never again to expose himself to the rudeness of a tasteless audience, and took leave of the theatre for ever. He lived twenty-eight years longer, without adding to the high literary reputation which he had attained. He read much while he retained his eyesight, and now and then wrote a short essay, or put an idle tale into verse; but he appears never to have planned any considerable work. The miscellaneous pieces which he published in 1710 are of little value, and have long been forgotten. The stock of fame which he had acquired by his comedies was sufficient, assisted by the graces of his manner and conversation, to secure for him a high place in the estimation of the world. During the winter, he lived among the most distinguished and agreeable people in London. His summers were passed at the splendid country-seats of ministers and peers. Literary envy and political faction, which in that age respected nothing else, respected his repose. He professed to be one of the party of which his patron Montagu, now Lord Halifax, was the head. But he had civil words and small good offices for men of every shade of opinion. And men of every shade of opinion spoke well of him in return. His means were for a long time scanty. The place which he had in possession barely enabled him to live with comfort. And, when the Tories came into power, some thought that he would lose even this moderate provision. But Harley, who was by no means disposed to adopt the exterminating policy of the October club, and who, with all his faults of understanding and temper, had a sincere kindness for men of genius, reassured the anxious poet by quoting very gracefully and happily the lines of Virgil, "Non obtusa adeo gestamus pectora Poeni, Nec tam aversus equos Tyria Sol jungit ab urbe." The indulgence with which Congreve was treated by the Tories was not purchased by any concession on his part which could justly offend the Whigs. It was his rare good fortune to share the triumph of his friends without having shared their proscription. When the House of Hanover came to the throne, he partook largely of the prosperity of those with whom he was connected. The reversion to which he had been nominated twenty years before fell in. He was made secretary to the island of Jamaica; and his whole income amounted to twelve hundred a year, a fortune which, for a single man, was in that age not only easy but splendid. He continued, however, to practise the frugality which he had learned when he could scarce spare, as Swift tells us, a shilling to pay the chairman who carried him to Lord Halifax's. Though he had nobody to save for, he laid up at least as much as he spent. The infirmities of age came early upon him. His habits had been intemperate; he suffered much from gout; and, when confined to his chamber, he had no longer the solace of literature. Blindness, the most cruel misfortune that can befall the lonely student, made his books useless to him. He was thrown on society for all his amusement; and in society his good breeding and vivacity made him always welcome. By the rising men of letters he was considered not as a rival, but as a classic. He had left their arena; he never measured his strength with them; and he was always loud in applause of their exertions. They could, therefore, entertain no jealousy of him and thought no more of detracting from his fame than of carping at the great men who had been lying a hundred years in Poets' Corner. Even the inmates of Grub Street, even the heroes of the Dunciad, were for once just to living merit. There can be no stronger illustration of the estimation in which Congreve was held than the fact that the English Iliad, a work which appeared with more splendid auspices than any other in our language, was dedicated to him. There was not a duke in the kingdom who would not have been proud of such a compliment. Dr. Johnson expresses great admiration for the independence of spirit which Pope showed on this occasion. "He passed over peers and statesmen to inscribe his Iliad to Congreve, with a magnanimity of which the praise had been complete, had his friend's virtue been equal to his wit. Why he was chosen for so great an honour, it is not now possible to know." It is certainly impossible to know; yet we think it is possible to guess. The translation of the Iliad had been zealously befriended by men of all political opinions. The poet who, at an early age, had been raised to affluence by the emulous liberality of Whigs and Tories, could not with propriety inscribe to a chief of either party a work which had been munificently patronised by both. It was necessary to find some person who was at once eminent and neutral. It was therefore necessary to pass over peers and statesmen. Congreve had a high name in letters. He had a high name in aristocratic circles. He lived on terms of civility with men of all parties. By a courtesy paid to him, neither the Ministers nor the leaders of the Opposition could be offended. The singular affectation which had from the first been characteristic of Congreve grew stronger and stronger as he advanced in life. At last it became disagreeable to him to hear his own comedies praised. Voltaire, whose soul was burned up by the raging desire for literary renown, was half puzzled and half disgusted by what he saw, during his visit to England, of this extraordinary whim. Congreve disclaimed the character of a poet, declared that his plays were trifles produced in an idle hour, and begged that Voltaire would consider him merely as a gentleman. "If you had been merely a gentleman," said Voltaire, "I should not have come to see you." Congreve was not a man of warm affections. Domestic ties he had none; and in the temporary connections which he formed with a succession of beauties from the green-room his heart does not appear to have been interested. Of all his attachments that to Mrs. Bracegirdle lasted the longest and was the most celebrated. This charming actress, who was, during many years, the idol of all London, whose face caused the fatal broil in which Mountfort fell, and for which Lord Mohun was tried by the Peers, and to whom the Earl of Scarsdale was said to have made honourable addresses, had conducted herself, in very trying circumstances, with extraordinary discretion. Congreve at length became her confidential friend. They constantly rode out together and dined together. Some people said that she was his mistress, and others that she would soon be his wife. He was at last drawn away from her by the influence of a wealthier and haughtier beauty. Henrietta, daughter of the great Marlborough, and Countess of Godolphin, had, on her father's death, succeeded to his dukedom, and to the greater part of his immense property. Her husband was an insignificant man, of whom Lord Chesterfield said that he came to the House of Peers only to sleep, and that he might as well sleep on the right as on the left of the woolsack. Between the Duchess and Congreve sprang up a most eccentric friendship. He had a seat every day at her table, and assisted in the direction of her concerts. That malignant old beldame, the Dowager Duchess Sarah, who had quarrelled with her daughter as she had quarrelled with every body else, affected to suspect that there was something wrong. But the world in general appears to have thought that a great lady might, without any imputation on her character, pay marked attention to a man of eminent genius who was near sixty years old, who was still older in appearance and in constitution, who was confined to his chair by gout, and who was unable to read from blindness. In the summer of 1728, Congreve was ordered to try the Bath waters. During his excursion he was overturned in his chariot, and received some severe internal injury from which he never recovered. He came back to London in a dangerous state, complained constantly of a pain in his side, and continued to sink, till in the following January he expired. He left ten thousand pounds, saved out of the emoluments of his lucrative places. Johnson says that this money ought to have gone to the Congreve family, which was then in great distress. Doctor Young and Mr. Leigh Hunt, two gentlemen who seldom agree with each other, but with whom, on this occasion, we are happy to agree, think that it ought to have gone to Mrs. Bracegirdle. Congreve bequeathed two hundred pounds to Mrs. Bracegirdle, and an equal sum to a certain Mrs. Jellat; but the bulk of his accumulations went to the Duchess of Marlborough, in whose immense wealth such a legacy was as a drop in the bucket. It might have raised the fallen fortunes of a Staffordshire squire; it might have enabled a retired actress to enjoy every comfort, and, in her sense, every luxury: but it was hardly sufficient to defray the Duchess's establishment for three months. The great lady buried her friend with a pomp seldom seen at the funerals of poets. The corpse lay in state under the ancient roof of the Jerusalem Chamber, and was interred in Westminster Abbey. The pall was borne by the Duke of Bridgewater, Lord Cobham, the Earl of Wilmington, who had been Speaker, and was afterwards First Lord of the Treasury, and other men of high consideration. Her Grace laid out her friend's bequest in a superb diamond necklace, which she wore in honour of him, and, if report is to be believed, showed her regard in ways much more extraordinary. It is said that a statue of him in ivory, which moved by clockwork, was placed daily at her table, and that she had a wax doll made in imitation of him, and that the feet of the doll were regularly blistered and anointed by the doctors, as poor Congreve's feet had been when he suffered from the gout. A monument was erected to the poet in Westminster Abbey, with an inscription written by the Duchess; and Lord Cobham, honoured him with a cenotaph, which seems to us, though that is a bold word, the ugliest and most absurd of the buildings at Stowe. We have said that Wycherley was a worse Congreve. There was, indeed, a remarkable analogy between the writings and lives of these two men. Both were gentlemen liberally educated. Both led town lives, and knew human nature only as it appears between Hyde Park and the Tower. Both were men of wit. Neither had much imagination. Both at an early age produced lively and profligate comedies. Both retired from the field while still in early manhood, and owed to their youthful achievements in literature whatever consideration they enjoyed in later life. Both, after they had ceased to write for the stage, published volumes of miscellanies which did little credit either to their talents or to their morals. Both, during their declining years, hung loose upon society; and both, in their last moments, made eccentric and unjustifiable dispositions of their estates. But in every point Congreve maintained his superiority to Wycherley. Wycherley had wit; but the wit of Congreve far outshines that of every comic writer, except Sheridan, who has within the last two centuries. Congreve had not, in, a large measure, the poetical faculty; but compared with Wycherley he might be called a great poet. Wycherley had some knowledge of books; but Congreve was a man of real learning. Congreve's offences against decorum, though highly culpable, were not so gross as those of Wycherley; nor did Congreve, like Wycherley, exhibit to the world the deplorable spectacle of a licentious dotage. Congreve died in the enjoyment of high consideration; Wycherley forgotten or despised. Congreve's will was absurd and capricious; but Wycherley's last actions appear to have been prompted by obdurate malignity. Here, at least for the present, we must stop. Vanbrugh and Farquhar are not men to be hastily dismissed, and we have not left ourselves space to do them justice. THE LIFE AND WRITINGS OF ADDISON (July 1843) The Life of Joseph Addison. BY LUCY AIKIN. 2 vols. 8vo. London: 1843. SOME reviewers are of opinion that a lady who dares to publish a book renounces by that act the franchises appertaining to her sex, and can claim no exemption from the utmost rigour of critical procedure. From that opinion we dissent. We admit, indeed, that in a country which boasts of many female writers, eminently qualified by their talents and acquirements to influence the public mind, it would be of most pernicious consequence that inaccurate history or unsound philosophy should be suffered to pass uncensured, merely because the offender chanced to be a lady. But we conceive that, on such occasions, a critic would do well to imitate the courteous Knight who found himself compelled by duty to keep the lists against Bradamante. He, we are told, defended successfully the cause of which he was the champion; but, before the fight began, exchanged Balisarda for a less deadly sword, of which he carefully blunted the point and edge. [Orlando Furioso, xiv. 68.] Nor are the immunities of sex the only immunities which Miss Aikin may rightfully plead. Several of her works, and especially the very pleasing Memoirs of the Reign of James the First have fully entitled her to the privileges enjoyed by good writers. One of those privileges we hold to be this, that such writers, when, either from the unlucky choice of a subject, or from the indolence too often produced by success, they happen to fail, shall not be subjected to the severe discipline which it is sometimes necessary to inflict upon dunces and impostors, but shall merely be reminded by a gentle touch, like that which the Laputan flapper roused his dreaming lord, that it is high time to wake. Our readers will probably infer from what we have said that Miss Aikin's book has disappointed us. The truth is, that she is not well acquainted with her subject. No person who is not familiar with the political and literary history of England during the reigns of William the Third, of Anne, and of George the First, can possibly write a good life of Addison. Now, we mean no reproach to Miss Aikin, and many will think that we pay her a compliment, when we say that her studies have taken a different direction. She is better acquainted with Shakspeare and Raleigh, than with Congreve and Prior; and is far more at home among the ruffs and peaked beards of Theobalds than among the Steenkirks and flowing periwigs which surrounded Queen Anne's tea-table at Hampton. She seems to have written about the Elizabethan age, because she had read much about it; she seems, on the other hand, to have read a little about the age of Addison, because she had determined to write about it. The consequence is that she has had to describe men and things without having either a correct or a vivid idea of them, and that she has often fallen into errors of a very serious kind. The reputation which Miss Aikin has justly earned stands so high, and the charm of Addison's letters is so great, that a second edition of this work may probably be required. If so, we hope that every paragraph will be revised, and that every date and fact about which there can be the smallest doubt will be carefully verified. To Addison himself we are bound by a sentiment as much like affection as any sentiment can be which is inspired by one who has been sleeping a hundred and twenty years in Westminster Abbey. We trust, however, that this feeling will not betray us into that abject idolatry which we have often had occasion to reprehend in others, and which seldom fails to make both the idolater and the idol ridiculous. A man of genius and virtue is but a man. All his powers cannot be equally developed; nor can we expect from him perfect self-knowledge. We need not, therefore, hesitate to admit that Addison has left us some compositions which do not rise above mediocrity, some heroic poems hardly equal to Parnell's, some criticism as superficial as Dr. Blair's, and a tragedy not very much better than Dr. Johnson's. It is praise enough to say of a writer that, in a high department of literature, in which many eminent writers have distinguished themselves, he has had no equal; and this may with strict justice be said of Addison. As a man, he may not have deserved the adoration which he received from those who, bewitched by his fascinating society, and indebted for all the comforts of life to his generous and delicate friendship, worshipped him nightly, in his favourite temple at Button's. But, after full inquiry and impartial reflection, we have long been convinced that he deserved as much love and esteem as can be justly claimed by any of our infirm and erring race. Some blemishes may undoubtedly be detected in his character; but the more carefully it is examined, the more will it appear, to use the phrase of the old anatomists, sound in the noble parts, free from all taint of perfidy, of cowardice, of cruelty, of ingratitude, of envy. Men may easily be named, in whom some particular good disposition has been more conspicuous than in Addison. But the just harmony of qualities, the exact temper between the stern and the humane virtues, the habitual observance of every law, not only of moral rectitude, but of moral grace and dignity, distinguish him from all men who have been tried by equally strong temptations, and about whose conduct we possess equally full information. His father was the Reverend Lancelot Addison, who, though eclipsed by his more celebrated son, made some figure in the world, and occupies with credit, two folio pages in the Biographia Britannica. Lancelot was sent up, as a poor scholar, from Westmoreland to Queen's College, Oxford, in the time of the Commonwealth, made some progress in learning, became, like most of his fellow-students, a violent Royalist, lampooned the heads of the University, and was forced to ask pardon on his bended knees. When he had left college, he earned a humble subsistence by reading the liturgy of the fallen Church to the families of those sturdy squires whose manor-houses were scattered over the Wild of Sussex. After the Restoration, his loyalty was rewarded with the post of chaplain to the garrison of Dunkirk. When Dunkirk was sold to France, he lost his employment. But Tangier had been ceded by Portugal to England as part of the marriage portion of the Infanta Catherine; and to Tangier Lancelot Addison was sent. A more miserable situation can hardly be conceived. It was difficult to say whether the unfortunate settlers were more tormented by the heats or by the rains, by the soldiers within the wall or by the Moors without it. One advantage the chaplain had. He enjoyed an excellent opportunity of studying the history and manners of Jews and Mahometans and of this opportunity he appears to have made excellent use. On his return to England, after some years of banishment, he published an interesting volume on the Polity and Religion of Barbary, and another on the Hebrew Customs and the State of Rabbinical Learning. He rose to eminence in his profession, and became one of the royal chaplains, a Doctor of Divinity, Archdeacon of Salisbury, and Dean of Lichfield. It is said that he would have been made a bishop after the Revolution, if he had not given offence to the Government by strenuously opposing, in the Convocation of 1689, the liberal policy of William and Tillotson. In 1672, not long after Dr. Addison's return from Tangier, his son Joseph was born. Of Joseph's childhood we know little. He learned his rudiments at school in his father's neighbourhood, and was then sent to the Charter House. The anecdotes which are popularly related about his boyish tricks do not harmonise very well with what we know of his riper years. There remains a tradition that he was the ringleader in a barring out, and another tradition that he ran away from school and hid himself in a wood, where he fed on berries and slept in a hollow tree, till after a long search he was discovered and brought home. If these stories be true, it would be curious to know by what moral discipline so mutinous and enterprising a lad was transformed into the gentlest and most modest of men. We have abundant proof that, whatever Joseph's pranks may have been, he pursued his studies vigorously and successfully. At fifteen he was not only fit for the university, but carried thither a classical taste and a stock of learning which would have done honour to a Master of Arts. He was entered at Queen's College, Oxford; but he had not been many months there, when some of his Latin verses fell by accident into the hands of Dr. Lancaster, Dean of Magdalen College. The young scholar's diction and versification were already such as veteran professors might envy. Dr. Lancaster was desirous to serve a boy of such promise; nor was an opportunity long wanting. The Revolution had just taken place; and nowhere had it been hailed with more delight than at Magdalen College. That great and opulent corporation had been treated by James, and by his Chancellor, with an insolence and injustice which, even in such a Prince and in such a Minister, may justly excite amazement, and which had done more than even the prosecution of the Bishops to alienate the Church of England from the throne. A president, duly elected, had been violently expelled from his dwelling: a Papist had been set over the society by a royal mandate: the Fellows who, in conformity with their oaths, had refused to submit to this usurper, had been driven forth from their quiet cloisters and gardens, to die of want or to live on charity. But the day of redress and retribution speedily came. The intruders were ejected: the venerable House was again inhabited by its old inmates: learning flourished under the rule of the wise and virtuous Hough; and with learning was united a mild and liberal spirit too often wanting in the princely colleges of Oxford. In consequence of the troubles through which the society had passed, there had been no valid election of new members during the year 1688. In 1689, therefore, there was twice the ordinary number of vacancies; and thus Dr. Lancaster found it easy to procure for his young friend admittance to the advantages of a foundation then generally esteemed the wealthiest in Europe. At Magdalen Addison resided during ten years. He was, at first, one of those scholars who were called Demies, but was subsequently elected a Fellow. His college is still proud of his name: his portrait still hangs in the hall; and strangers are still told that his favourite walk was under the elms which fringe the meadow on the banks of the Cherwell. It is said, and is highly probable, that he was distinguished among his fellow- students by the delicacy of his feelings, by the shyness of his manners, and by the assiduity with which he often prolonged his studies far into the night. It is certain that his reputation for ability and learning stood high. Many years later, the ancient doctors of Magdalen continued to talk in their common room of his boyish compositions, and expressed their sorrow that no copy of exercises so remarkable had been preserved. It is proper, however, to remark that Miss Aikin has committed the error, very pardonable in a lady, of overrating Addison's classical attainments. In one department of learning, indeed, his proficiency was such as it is hardly possible to overrate. His knowledge of the Latin poets, from Lucretius and Catullus down to Claudian and Prudentius, was singularly exact and profound. He understood them thoroughly, entered into their spirit, and had the finest and most discriminating perception of all their peculiarities of style and melody; nay, he copied their manner with admirable skill, and surpassed, we think, all their British imitators who had preceded him, Buchanan and Milton alone excepted. This is high praise; and beyond this we cannot with justice go. It is clear that Addison's serious attention during his residence at the university, was almost entirely concentrated on Latin poetry, and that, if he did not wholly neglect other provinces of ancient literature, he vouchsafed to them only a cursory glance. He does not appear to have attained more than an ordinary acquaintance with the political and moral writers of Rome; nor was his own Latin prose by any means equal to his Latin Verse. His knowledge of Greek, though doubtless such as was, in his time, thought respectable at Oxford, was evidently less than that which many lads now carry away every year from Eton and Rugby. A minute examination of his works, if we had time to make such an examination, would fully bear out these remarks. We will briefly advert to a few of the facts on which our judgment is grounded. Great praise is due to the Notes which Addison appended to his version of the second and third books of the Metamorphoses. Yet those notes, while they show him to have been, in his own domain, an accomplished scholar, show also how confined that domain was. They are rich in apposite references to Virgil, Statius, and Claudian; but they contain not a single illustration drawn from the Greek poets. Now, if, in the whole compass of Latin literature, there be a passage which stands in need of illustration drawn from the Greek poets, it is the story of Pentheus in the third book of the Metamorphoses. Ovid was indebted for that story to Euripides and Theocritus, both of whom he has sometimes followed minutely. But neither to Euripides nor to Theocritus does Addison make the faintest allusion; and we, therefore, believe that we do not wrong him by supposing that he had little or no knowledge of their works. His travels in Italy, again, abound with classical quotations happily introduced; but scarcely one of those quotations is in prose. He draws more illustrations from Ausonius and Manilius than from Cicero. Even his notions of the political and military affairs of the Romans seem to be derived from poets and poetasters. Spots made memorable by events which have changed the destinies of the world, and which have been worthily recorded by great historians, bring to his mind only scraps of some ancient versifier. In the gorge of the Apennines he naturally remembers the hardships which Hannibal's army endured, and proceeds to cite, not the authentic narrative of Polybius, not the picturesque narrative of Livy, but the languid hexameters of Silius Italicus. On the banks of the Rubicon he never thinks of Plutarch's lively description, or of the stern conciseness of the Commentaries, or of those letters to Atticus which so forcibly express the alternations of hope and fear in a sensitive mind at a great crisis. His only authority for the events of the civil war is Lucan. All the best ancient works of art at Rome and Florence are Greek. Addison saw them, however, without recalling one single verse of Pindar, of Callimachus, or of the Attic dramatists; but they brought to his recollection innumerable passages of Horace, Juvenal, Statius, and Ovid. The same may be said of the Treatise on Medals. In that pleasing work we find about three hundred passages extracted with great judgment from the Roman poets; but we do not recollect a single passage taken from any Roman orator or historian; and we are confident that not a line is quoted from any Greek writer. No person, who had derived all his information on the subject of medals from Addison, would suspect that the Greek coins were in historical interest equal, and in beauty of execution far superior to those of Rome. If it were necessary to find any further proof that Addison's classical knowledge was confined within narrow limits, that proof would be furnished by his Essay on the Evidences of Christianity. The Roman poets throw little or no light on the literary and historical questions which he is under the necessity of examining in that Essay. He is, therefore, left completely in the dark; and it is melancholy to see how helplessly he gropes his way from blunder to blunder. He assigns, as grounds for his religious belief, stories as absurd as that of the Cock-Lane ghost, and forgeries as rank as Ireland's Vortigern, puts faith in the lie about the Thundering Legion, is convinced that Tiberius moved the senate to admit Jesus among the gods, and pronounces the letter of Abgarus King of Edessa to be a record of great authority. Nor were these errors the effects of superstition; for to superstition Addison was by no means prone. The truth is that he was writing about what he did not understand. Miss Aikin has discovered a letter, from which it appears that, while Addison resided at Oxford, he was one of several writers whom the booksellers engaged to make an English version of Herodotus; and she infers that he must have been a good Greek scholar. We can allow very little weight to this argument, when we consider that his fellow-labourers were to have been Boyle and Blackmore. Boyle is remembered chiefly as the nominal author of the worst book on Greek history and philology that ever was printed; and this book, bad as it is, Boyle was unable to produce without help. Of Blackmore's attainments in the ancient tongues, it may be sufficient to say that, in his prose, he has confounded an aphorism with an apophthegm, and that when, in his verse, he treats of classical subjects, his habit is to regale his readers with four false quantities to a page. It is probable that the classical acquirements of Addison were of as much service to him as if they had been more extensive. The world generally gives its admiration, not to the man who does what nobody else even attempts to do, but to the man who does best what multitudes do well. Bentley was so immeasurably superior to all the other scholars of his time that few among them could discover his superiority. But the accomplishment in which Addison excelled his contemporaries was then, as it is now, highly valued and assiduously cultivated at all English seats of learning. Everybody who had been at a public school had written Latin verses; many had written such verses with tolerable success, and were quite able to appreciate, though by no means able to rival, the skill with which Addison imitated Virgil. His lines on the Barometer and the Bowling Green were applauded by hundreds, to whom the Dissertation on the Epistles of Phalaris was as unintelligible as the hieroglyphics on an obelisk. Purity of style, and an easy flow of numbers, are common to all Addison's Latin poems. Our favourite piece is the Battle of the Cranes and Pigmies; for in that piece we discern a gleam of the fancy and humour which many years later enlivened thousands of breakfast tables. Swift boasted that he was never known to steal a hint; and he certainly owed as little to his predecessors as any modern writer. Yet we cannot help suspecting that he borrowed, perhaps unconsciously, one of the happiest touches in his "Voyage to Lilliput" from Addison's verses. Let our readers judge. "The Emperor," says Gulliver, "is Tatler by about the breadth of my nail than any of his court, which alone is enough to strike an awe into the beholders." About thirty years before Gulliver's Travels appeared, Addison wrote these lines: "Jamque acies inter medias sese arduus infert Pygmeadum ductor, qui, majestate verendus, Incessuque gravis, reliquos supereminet omnes Mole gigantea, mediamque exsurgit in ulnam." The Latin poems of Addison were greatly and justly admired both at Oxford and Cambridge, before his name had ever been heard by the wits who thronged the coffee-houses round Drury Lane Theatre. In his twenty-second year, he ventured to appear before the public as a writer of English verse. He addressed some complimentary lines to Dryden, who, after many triumphs and many reverses, had at length reached a secure and lonely eminence among the literary men of that age. Dryden appears to have been much gratified by the young scholar's praise; and an interchange of civilities and good offices followed. Addison was probably introduced by Dryden to Congreve, and was certainly presented by Congreve to Charles Montague, who was then Chancellor of the Exchequer, and leader of the Whig party in the House of Commons. At this time Addison seemed inclined to devote himself to poetry. He published a translation of part of the fourth Georgic, Lines on King William, and other performances of equal value, that is to say, of no value at all. But in those days, the public was in the habit of receiving with applause pieces which would now have little chance of obtaining the Newdigate prize or the Seatonian prize. And the reason is obvious. The heroic couplet was then the favourite measure. The art of arranging words in that measure, so that the lines may flow smoothly, that the accents may fall correctly, that the rhymes may strike the ear strongly, and that there may be a pause at the end of every distich, is an art as mechanical as that of mending a kettle or shoeing a horse, and may be learned by any human being who has sense enough to learn anything. But, like other mechanical arts, it was gradually improved by means of many experiments and many failures. It was reserved for Pope to discover the trick, to make himself complete master of it, and to teach it to everybody else. From the time when his Pastorals appeared, heroic versification became matter of rule and compass; and, before long, all artists were on a level. Hundreds of dunces who never blundered on one happy thought or expression were able to write reams of couplets which, as far as euphony was concerned, could not be distinguished from those of Pope himself, and which very clever writers of the reign of Charles the Second, Rochester, for example, or Marvel, or Oldham, would have contemplated with admiring despair. Ben Jonson was a great man, Hoole a very small man. But Hoole coming after Pope, had learned how to manufacture decasyllable verses, and poured them forth by thousands and tens of thousands, all as well turned, as smooth, and as like each other as the blocks which have passed through Mr. Brunel's mill in the dockyard at Portsmouth. Ben's heroic couplets resemble blocks rudely hewn out by an unpractised hand, with a blunt hatchet. Take as a specimen his translation Of a celebrated passage in the Aeneid: "This child our parent earth, stirr'd up with spite Of all the gods, brought forth, and, as some write, She was last sister of that giant race That sought to scale Jove's court, right swift of pace, And swifter far of wing, a monster vast And dreadful. Look, how many plumes are placed On her huge corpse, so many waking eyes Stick underneath, and, which may stranger rise In the report, as many tongues she wears." Compare with these jagged misshapen distichs the neat fabric which Hoole's machine produces in unlimited abundance. We take the first lines on which we open in his version of Tasso. They are neither better nor worse than the rest O thou, whoe'er thou art, whose steps are led, By choice or fate, these lonely shores to tread, No greater wonders east or west can boast Than yon small island on the pleasing coast. If e'er thy sight would blissful scenes explore, The current pass, and seek the further shore." Ever since the time of Pope there had been a glut of lines of this sort; and we are now as little disposed to admire a man for being able to write them, as for being able to write his name. But in the days of William the Third such versification was rare; and a rhymer who had any skill in it passed for a great poet, just as in the dark ages a person who could write his name passed for a great clerk. Accordingly, Duke, Stepney, Granville, Walsh, and others whose only title to fame was that they said in tolerable metre what might have been as well said in prose, or what was not worth saying at all, were honoured with marks of distinction which ought to be reserved for genius. With these Addison must have ranked, if he had not earned true and lasting glory by performances which very little resembled his juvenile poems. Dryden was now busied with Virgil, and obtained from Addison a critical preface to the Georgics. In return for this service, and for other services of the same kind, the veteran poet, in the postscript to the translation of the Aeniad complimented his young friend with great liberality, and indeed with more liberality than sincerity. He affected to be afraid that his own performance would not sustain a comparison with the version of the fourth Georgic, by "the most ingenious Mr. Addison of Oxford." "After his bees," added Dryden, "my latter swarm is scarcely worth the hiving." The time had now arrived when it was necessary for Addison to choose a calling. Everything seemed to point his course towards the clerical profession. His habits were regular, his opinions orthodox. His college had large ecclesiastical preferment in its gift, and boasts that it has given at least one bishop to almost every see in England. Dr. Lancelot Addison held an honourable place in the Church, and had set his heart on seeing his son a clergyman. it is clear, from some expressions in the young man's rhymes, that his intention was to take orders. But Charles Montague interfered. Montague had first brought himself into notice by verses well-timed and not contemptibly written, but never, we think, rising above mediocrity. Fortunately for himself and for his country, he early quitted poetry, in which he could never have attained a rank as high as that of Dorset or Rochester, and turned his mind to official and parliamentary business. It is written that the ingenious person who undertook to instruct Rasselas, prince of Abyssinia, in the art of flying, ascended an eminence, waved his wings, sprang into the air, and instantly dropped into the lake. But it is added that the wings, which were unable to support him through the sky, bore him up effectually as soon as he was in the water. This is no bad type of the fate of Charles Montague and of men like him. When he attempted to soar into the regions of poetical invention, he altogether failed; but, as soon as he had descended from that ethereal elevation into a lower and grosser element, his talents instantly raised him above the mass. He became a distinguished financier, debater, courtier, and party leader. He still retained his fondness for the pursuits of his early days; but he showed that fondness not by wearying the public with his own feeble performances, but by discovering and encouraging literary excellence in others. A crowd of wits and poets, who would easily have vanquished him as a competitor, revered him as a judge and a patron. In his plans for the encouragement of learning, he was cordially supported by the ablest and most virtuous of his colleagues, the Lord Chancellor Somers. Though both these great statesmen had a sincere love of letters, it was not solely from a love of letters that they were desirous to enlist youths of high intellectual qualifications in the public service. The Revolution had altered the whole system of government. Before that event the press had been controlled by censors, and the Parliament had sat only two months in eight years. Now the press was free, and had begun to exercise unprecedented influence on the public mind. Parliament met annually and sat long. The chief power in the State had passed to the House of Commons. At such a conjuncture, it was natural that literary and oratorical talents should rise in value. There was danger that a government which neglected such talents might be subverted by them. It was, therefore, a profound and enlightened policy which led Montague and Somers to attach such talents to the Whig party, by the strongest ties both of interest and of gratitude. It is remarkable that in a neighbouring country, we have recently seen similar effects follow from similar causes. The revolution of July 1830 established representative government in France. The men of letters instantly rose to the highest importance in the State. At the present moment most of the persons whom we see at the head both of the Administration and of the Opposition have been professors, historians, journalists, poets. The influence of the literary class in England, during the generation which followed the Revolution, was great, but by no means so great as it has lately been in France. For in England, the aristocracy of intellect had to contend with a powerful and deeply-rooted aristocracy of a very different kind. France had no Somersets and Shrewsburys to keep down her Addisons and Priors. It was in the year 1699, when Addison had just completed his twenty-seventh year, that the course of his life was finally determined. Both the great chiefs of the Ministry were kindly disposed towards him. In political opinions he already was what he continued to be through life, a firm, though a moderate Whig. He had addressed the most polished and vigorous of his early English lines to Somers, and had dedicated to Montague a Latin poem, truly Virgilian, both in style and rhythm, on the peace of Ryswick. The wish of the young poet's great friends was, it should seem, to employ him in the service of the Crown abroad. But an intimate knowledge of the French language was a qualification indispensable to a diplomatist; and this qualification Addison had not acquired. It was, therefore, thought desirable that he should pass some time on the Continent in preparing himself for official employment. His own means were not such as would enable him to travel: but a pension of three hundred pounds a year was procured for him by the interest of the Lord Chancellor. It seems to have been apprehended that some difficulty might be started by the rulers of Magdalen College. But the Chancellor of the Exchequer wrote in the strongest terms to Hough. The State--such was the purport of Montague's letter-- could not, at that time spare to the Church such a man as Addison. Too many high civil posts were already occupied by adventurers, who, destitute of every liberal art and sentiment, at once pillaged and disgraced the country which they pretended to serve. It had become necessary to recruit for the public service from a very different class, from that class of which Addison was the representative. The close of the Minister's letter was remarkable. "I am called," he said, "an enemy of the Church. But I will never do it any other injury than keeping Mr. Addison out of it." This interference was successful; and, in the summer of 1699, Addison, made a rich man by his pension, and still retaining his fellowship, quitted his beloved Oxford, and set out on his travels. He crossed from Dover to Calais, proceeded to Paris, and was received there with great kindness and politeness by a kinsman of his friend Montague, Charles Earl of Manchester, who had just been appointed Ambassador to the Court of France. The Countess, a Whig and a toast, was probably as gracious as her lord; for Addison long retained an agreeable recollection of the impression which she at this time made on him, and in some lively lines written on the glasses of the Kit-Cat Club, described the envy which her cheeks, glowing with the genuine bloom of England, had excited among the painted beauties of Versailles. Lewis the Fourteenth was at this time expiating the vices of his youth by a devotion which had no root in reason, and bore no fruit of charity. The servile literature of France had changed its character to suit the changed character of the prince. No book appeared that had not an air of sanctity. Racine, who was just dead, had passed the close of his life in writing sacred dramas; and Dacier was seeking for the Athanasian mysteries in Plato. Addison described this state of things in a short but lively and graceful letter to Montague. Another letter, written about the same time to the Lord Chancellor, conveyed the strongest assurances of gratitude and attachment. "The only return I can make to your Lordship," said Addison, "will be to apply myself entirely to my business." With this view he quitted Paris and repaired to Blois, a place where it was supposed that the French language was spoken in its highest purity, and where not a single Englishman could be found. Here he passed some months pleasantly and profitably. Of his way of life at Blois, one of his associates, an Abbe named Philippeaux, gave an account to Joseph Spence. If this account is to be trusted, Addison studied much, mused much, talked little, had fits of absence, and either had no love affairs, or was too discreet to confide them to the Abbe. A man who, even when surrounded by fellow-countrymen and fellow-students, had always been remarkably shy and silent, was not likely to be loquacious in a foreign tongue, and among foreign companions. But it is clear from Addison's letters, some of which were long after published in the Guardian, that, while he appeared to be absorbed in his own meditations, he was really observing French society with that keen and sly, yet not ill- natured side glance, which was peculiarly his own. From Blois he returned to Paris; and, having now mastered the French language, found great pleasure in the society of French philosophers and poets. He gave an account, in a letter to Bishop Hough, of two highly interesting conversations, one with Malbranche, the other with Boileau. Malbranche expressed great partiality for the English, and extolled the genius of Newton, but shook his head when Hobbes was mentioned, and was indeed so unjust as to call the author of the Leviathan a poor, silly creature. Addison's modesty restrained him from fully relating, in his letter, the circumstances of his introduction to Boileau. Boileau, having survived the friends and rivals of his youth, old, deaf, and melancholy, lived in retirement, seldom went either to Court or to the Academy, and was almost inaccessible to strangers. Of the English and of English literature he knew nothing. He had hardly heard the name of Dryden. Some of our countrymen, in the warmth of their patriotism, have asserted that this ignorance must have been affected. We own that we see no ground for such a supposition. English literature was to the French of the age of Lewis the Fourteenth what German literature was to our own grandfathers. Very few, we suspect, of the accomplished men who, sixty or seventy years ago, used to dine in Leicester Square with Sir Joshua, or at Streatham. with Mrs. Thrale, had the slightest notion that Wieland was one of the first wits and poets, and Lessing, beyond all dispute, the first critic in Europe. Boileau knew just as little about the Paradise Lost, and about Absalom and Achitophel; but he had read Addison's Latin poems, and admired them greatly. They had given him, he said, quite a new notion of the state of learning and taste among the English. Johnson will have it that these praises were insincere. "Nothing," says he, "is better known of Boileau than that he had an injudicious and peevish contempt of modern Latin; and therefore his profession of regard was probably the effect of his civility rather than approbation." Now, nothing is better known of Boileau than that he was singularly sparing of compliments. We do not remember that either friendship or fear ever induced him to bestow praise on any composition which he did not approve. On literary questions his caustic, disdainful, and self-confident spirit rebelled against that authority to which everything else in France bowed down.  He had the spirit to tell Lewis the Fourteenth firmly and even rudely, that his Majesty knew Nothing about poetry, and admired verses which were detestable. What was there in Addison's position that could induce the satirist, Whose stern and fastidious temper had been the dread of two generations, to turn sycophant for the first and last time? Nor was Boileau's contempt of modern Latin either injudicious or peevish. He thought, indeed, that no poem of the first order would ever be written in a dead language. And did he think amiss? Has not the experience of centuries confirmed his opinion? Boileau also thought it probable that, in the best modern Latin, a writer of the Augustan age would have detected ludicrous improprieties. And who can think otherwise? What modern scholar can honestly declare that he sees the smallest impurity in the style of Livy? Yet is it not certain that, in the style of Livy, Pollio, whose taste had been formed on the banks of the Tiber, detected the inelegant idiom of the Po? Has any modern scholar understood Latin better than Frederic the Great understood French? Yet is it not notorious that Frederic the Great, after reading, speaking, writing French, and nothing but French, during more than half a century, after unlearning his mother tongue in order to learn French, after living familiarly during many years with French associates, could not, to the last, compose in French, without imminent risk of committing some mistake which would have moved a smile in the literary circles of Paris? Do we believe that Erasmus and Fracastorius wrote Latin as well as Dr. Robertson and Sir Walter Scott wrote English? And are there not in the Dissertation on India, the last of Dr. Robertson's works, in Waverley, in Marmion, Scotticisms at which a London apprentice would laugh? But does it follow, because we think thus, that we can find nothing to admire in the noble alcaics of Gray, or in the playful elegiacs of Vincent Bourne? Surely not. Nor was Boileau so ignorant or tasteless as to be incapable of appreciating good modern Latin. In the very letter to which Johnson alludes, Boileau says--"Ne croyez pas pourtant que je veuille par la blamer les vers Latins que vous m'avez envoyes d'un de vos illustres academiciens. Je les ai trouves fort beaux, et dignes de Vida et de Sannazar, mais non pas d'Horace et de Virgile." Several poems, in modern Latin, have been praised by Boileau quite as liberally as it was his habit to praise anything. He says, for example, of the Pere Fraguier's epigrams, that Catullus seems to have come to life again. But the best proof that Boileau did not feel the undiscerning contempt for modern Latin verses which has been imputed to him, is, that he wrote and published Latin verses in several metres. Indeed it happens, curiously enough, that the most severe censure ever pronounced by him on modern Latin is conveyed in Latin hexameters. We allude to the fragment which begins "Quid numeris iterum me balbutire Latinis, Longe Alpes citra natum de patre Sicambro, Musa, jubes?" For these reasons we feel assured that the praise which Boileau bestowed on the Machinae Gesticulantes and the Gerano Pygmaomachia, was sincere. He certainly opened himself to Addison with a freedom which was a sure indication of esteem. Literature was the chief subject of conversation. The old man talked on his favourite theme much and well, indeed, as his young hearer thought, incomparably well. Boileau had undoubtedly some of the qualities of a great critic. He wanted imagination; but he had strong sense. His literary code was formed on narrow principles; but in applying it, he showed great judgment and penetration. In mere style, abstracted from the ideas of which style is the garb, his taste was excellent. He was well acquainted with the great Greek writers; and, though unable fully to appreciate their creative genius, admired the majestic simplicity of their manner, and had learned from them to despise bombast and tinsel. It is easy we think, to discover, in the Spectator, and the Guardian: traces of the influence, in part salutary and in part pernicious, which the mind of Boileau had on the mind of Addison. While Addison was at Paris, an event took place which made that capital a disagreeable residence for an Englishman and a Whig. Charles, second of the name, King of Spain, died; and bequeathed his dominions to Philip, Duke of Anjou, a younger son of the Dauphin. The King of France, in direct violation of his engagements both with Great Britain and with the States-General, accepted the bequest on behalf of his grandson. The House of Bourbon was at the summit of human grandeur. England had been outwitted, and found herself in a situation at once degrading and perilous. The people of France, not presaging the calamities by which they were destined to expiate the perfidy of their sovereign, went mad with pride and delight. Every man looked as if a great estate had just been left him. "The French conversation," said Addison, "begins to grow insupportable; that which was before the vainest nation in the world is now worse than ever." Sick of the arrogant exultation of the Parisians, and probably foreseeing that the peace between France and England could not be of long duration, he set off for Italy. In December 1701 [It is strange that Addison should, in the first line of his travels, have misdated his departure from Marseilles by a whole year, and still more strange that this slip of the pen, which throws the whole narrative into inextricable confusion, should have been repeated in a succession of editions, and never detected by Tickell or by Hurd.] he embarked at Marseilles. As he glided along the Ligurian coast, he was delighted by the sight of myrtles and olive trees, which retained their verdure under the winter solstice. Soon, however, he encountered one of the black storms of the Mediterranean. The captain of the ship gave up all for lost, and confessed himself to a capuchin who happened to be on board. The English heretic, in the meantime, fortified himself against the terrors of death with devotions of a very different kind. How strong an impression this perilous voyage made on him, appears from the ode, "How are thy servants blest, 0 Lord!" which was long after published in the Spectator. After some days of discomfort and danger, Addison was glad to land at Savona, and to make his way, over mountains where no road had yet been hewn out by art, to the city of Genoa. At Genoa, still ruled by her own Doge, and by the nobles whose names were inscribed on her Book of Gold, Addison made a short stay. He admired the narrow streets overhung by long lines of towering palaces, the walls rich with frescoes, the gorgeous temple of the Annunciation, and the tapestries whereon were recorded the long glories of the House of Doria. Thence he hastened to Milan, where he contemplated the Gothic magnificence of the cathedral with more wonder than pleasure. He passed Lake Benacus while a gale was blowing, and saw the waves raging as they raged when Virgil looked upon them. At Venice, then the gayest spot in Europe, the traveller spent the Carnival, the gayest season of the year, in the midst of masques, dances, and serenades. Here he was at once diverted and provoked, by the absurd dramatic pieces which then disgraced the Italian stage. To one of those pieces, however, he was indebted for a valuable hint. He was present when a ridiculous play on the death of Cato was performed. Cato, it seems, was in love with a daughter of Scipio. The lady had given her heart to Caesar. The rejected lover determined to destroy himself. He appeared seated in his library, a dagger in his hand, a Plutarch and a Tasso before him; and, in this position, he pronounced a soliloquy before he struck the blow. We are surprised that so remarkable a circumstance as this should have escaped the notice of all Addison's biographers. There cannot, we conceive, be the smallest doubt that this scene, in spite of its absurdities and anachronisms, struck the traveller's imagination, and suggested to him the thought of bringing Cato on the English stage. It is well known that about this time he began his tragedy, and that he finished the first four acts before he returned to England, On his way from Venice to Rome, he was drawn some miles out of the beaten road, by a wish to see the smallest independent state in Europe. On a rock where the snow still lay, though the Italian spring was now far advanced, was perched the little fortress of San Marino. The roads which led to the secluded town were so bad that few travellers had ever visited it, and none had ever published an account of it. Addison could not suppress a good- natured smile at the simple manners and institutions of this singular community. But he observed, with the exultation of a Whig, that the rude mountain tract which formed the territory of the republic swarmed with an honest, healthy, and contented peasantry, while the rich plain which surrounded the metropolis of civil and spiritual tyranny was scarcely less desolate than the uncleared wilds of America. At Rome Addison remained on his first visit only long enough to catch a glimpse of St. Peter's and of the Pantheon. His haste is the more extraordinary because the Holy Week was close at hand. He has given no hint which can enable us to pronounce why he chose to fly from a spectacle which every year allures from distant regions persons of far less taste and sensibility than his. Possibly, travelling, as he did, at the charge of a government distinguished by its enmity to the Church of Rome, he may have thought that it would be imprudent in him to assist at the most magnificent rite of that Church. Many eyes would be upon him; and he might find it difficult to behave in such a manner as to give offence neither to his patrons in England, nor to those among whom he resided. Whatever his motives may have been, he turned his back on the most august and affecting ceremony which is known among men, and posted along the Appian Way to Naples. Naples was then destitute of what are now, perhaps, its chief attractions. The lovely bay and the awful mountain were indeed there. But a farmhouse stood on the theatre of Herculaneum, and rows of vines grew over the streets of Pompeii. The temples of Paestum had not indeed been hidden from the eye of man by any great convulsion of nature; but, strange to say, their existence was a secret even to artists and antiquaries. Though situated within a few hours' journey of a great capital, where Salvator had not long before painted, and where Vico was then lecturing, those noble remains were as little known to Europe as the ruined cities overgrown by the forests of Yucatan. What was to be seen at Naples, Addison saw. He climbed Vesuvius, explored the tunnel of Posilipo, and wandered among the vines and almond trees of Capreae. But neither the wonders of nature, nor those of art, could so occupy his attention as to prevent him from noticing, though cursorily, the abuses of the Government and the misery of the people. The great kingdom which had just descended to Philip the Fifth, was in a state of paralytic dotage. Even Castile and Aragon were sunk in wretchedness. Yet, compared with the Italian dependencies of the Spanish crown, Castile and Aragon might be called prosperous. It is clear that all the observations which Addison made in Italy tended to confirm him in the political opinions which he had adopted at home. To the last, he always spoke of foreign travel as the best cure for Jacobitism. In his Freeholder, the Tory fox-hunter asks what travelling is good for, except to teach a man to jabber French, and to talk against passive obedience. From Naples, Addison returned to Rome by sea, along the coast which his favourite Virgil had celebrated. The felucca passed the headland where the oar and trumpet were placed by the Trojan adventurers on the tomb of Misenus, and anchored at night under the shelter of the fabled promontory of Circe. The voyage ended in the Tiber, still overhung with dark verdure, and still turbid with yellow sand, as when it met the eyes of Aeneas. From the ruined port of Ostia, the stranger hurried to Rome; and at Rome he remained during those hot and sickly months when, even in the Augustan age, all who could make their escape fled from mad dogs and from streets black with funerals, to gather the first figs of the season in the country. It is probable that, when he, long after, poured forth in verse his gratitude to the Providence which had enabled him to breathe unhurt in tainted air, he was thinking of the August and September which he passed at Rome. It was not till the latter end of October that he tore himself away from the masterpieces of ancient and modern art which are collected in the city so long the mistress of the world. He then journeyed northward, passed through Sienna, and for a moment forgot his prejudices in favour of classic architecture as he looked on the magnificent cathedral. At Florence he spent some days with the Duke of Shrewsbury, who, cloyed with the pleasures of ambition, and impatient of its pains, fearing both parties, and loving neither, had determined to hide in an Italian retreat talents and accomplishments which, if they had been united with fixed principles and civil courage, might have made him the foremost man of his age. These days we are told, passed pleasantly; and we can easily believe it. For Addison was a delightful companion when he was at his ease; and the Duke, though he seldom forgot that he was a Talbot, had the invaluable art of putting at case all who came near him. Addison gave some time to Florence, and especially to the sculptures in the Museum, which he preferred even to those of the Vatican. He then pursued his journey through a country in which the ravages of the last war were still discernible, and in which all men were looking forward with dread to a still fiercer conflict. Eugene had already descended from the Rhaetian Alps, to dispute with Catinat the rich plain of Lombardy. The faithless ruler of Savoy was still reckoned among the allies of Lewis. England had not yet actually declared war against France: but Manchester had left Paris; and the negotiations which produced the Grand Alliance against the House of Bourbon were in progress. Under such circumstances, it was desirable for an English traveller to reach neutral ground without delay. Addison resolved to cross Mont Cenis. It was December; and the road was very different from that which now reminds the stranger of the power and genius of Napoleon. The winter, however, was mild; and the passage was, for those times, easy. To this journey Addison alluded when, in the ode which we have already quoted, he said that for him the Divine goodness had warmed the hoary Alpine hills. It was in the midst of the eternal snow that he composed his "Epistle" to his friend Montague, now Lord Halifax. That Epistle, once widely renowned, is now known only to curious readers, and will hardly be considered by those to whom it is known as in any perceptible degree heightening Addison's fame. It is, however, decidedly superior to any English composition which he had previously published. Nay, we think it quite as good as any poem in heroic metre which appeared during the interval between the death of Dryden and the publication of the Essay on Criticism. It contains passages as good as the second-rate passages of Pope, and would have added to the reputation of Parnell or Prior. But, whatever be the literary merits or defects of the Epistle, it undoubtedly does honour to the principles and spirit of the author. Halifax had now nothing to give. He had fallen from power, had been held up to obloquy, had been impeached by the House of Commons, and, though his Peers had dismissed the impeachment, had, as it seemed, little chance of ever again filling high office. The Epistle, written, at such a time, is one among many proofs that there was no mixture of cowardice or meanness in the suavity and moderation which distinguished Addison from all the other public men of those stormy times. At Geneva, the traveller learned that a partial change of Ministry had taken place in England, and that the Earl of Manchester had become Secretary of State. Manchester exerted himself to serve his young friend. It was thought advisable that an English agent should be near the person of Eugene in Italy; and Addison, whose diplomatic education was now finished, was the man selected. He was preparing to enter on his honourable functions, when all his prospects were for a time darkened by the death of William the Third. Anne had long felt a strong aversion, personal, political, and religious, to the Whig party. That aversion appeared in the first measure of her reign. Manchester was deprived of the seals, after he had held them only a few weeks. Neither Somers nor Halifax was sworn of the Privy Council. Addison shared the fate of his three patrons. His hopes of employment in the public service were at an end; his pension was stopped; and it was necessary for him to support himself by his own exertions. He became tutor to a young English traveller, and appears to have rambled with his pupil over great part of Switzerland and Germany. At this time he wrote his pleasing Treatise on Medals. It was not published till after his death; but several distinguished scholars saw the manuscript, and gave just praise to the grace of the style, and to the learning and ingenuity evinced by the quotations. From Germany Addison repaired to Holland, where he learned the melancholy news of his father's death. After passing some months in the United Provinces, he returned about the close of the year 1703 to England. He was there cordially received by his friends, and introduced by them into the Kit Cat Club, a society in which were collected all the various talents and accomplishments which then gave lustre to the Whig party. Addison was, during some months after his return from the Continent, hard pressed by pecuniary difficulties. But it was soon in the power of his noble patrons to serve him effectually. A political change, silent and gradual, but of the highest importance, was in daily progress. The accession of Anne had been hailed by the Tories with transports of joy and hope; and for a time it seemed that the Whigs had fallen, never to rise again. The throne was surrounded by men supposed to be attached to the prerogative and to the Church; and among these none stood so high in the favour of the Sovereign as the Lord Treasurer Godolphin and the Captain-General Marlborough. The country gentlemen and country clergymen had fully expected that the policy of these Ministers would be directly opposed to that which had been almost constantly followed by William; that the landed interest would be favoured at the expense of trade; that no addition would be made to the funded debt; that the privileges conceded to Dissenters by the late King would be curtailed, if not withdrawn; that the war with France, if there must be such a war, would, on our part, be almost entirely naval; and that the Government would avoid close connections with foreign powers, and, above all, with Holland. But the country gentlemen and country clergymen were fated to be deceived, not for the last time. The prejudices and passions which raged without control in vicarages, in cathedral closes, and in the manor-houses of fox-hunting squires, were not shared by the chiefs of the Ministry. Those statesmen saw that it was both for the public interest, and for their own interest, to adopt a Whig policy, at least as respected the alliances of the country and the conduct of the war. But, if the foreign policy of the Whigs were adopted, it was impossible to abstain from adopting also their financial policy. The natural consequences followed. The rigid Tories were alienated from the Government. The votes of the Whigs became necessary to it. The votes of the Whigs could be secured only by further concessions; and further concessions the Queen was induced to make. At the beginning of the year 1704, the state of parties bore a close analogy to the state of parties in 1826. In 1826, as in 1704, there was a Tory Ministry divided into two hostile sections. The position of Mr. Canning and his friends in 1826 corresponded to that which Marlborough and Godolphin occupied in 1704. Nottingham and Jersey were, in 1704, what Lord Eldon and Lord Westmoreland were in 1826. The Whigs of 1704 were in a situation resembling that in which the Whigs of 1826 stood. In 1704, Somers, Halifax, Sunderland, Cowper, were not in office. There was no avowed coalition between them and the moderate Tories. It is probable that no direct communication tending to such a coalition had yet taken place; yet all men saw that such a coalition was inevitable, nay, that it was already half formed. Such, or nearly such, was the state of things when tidings arrived of the great battle fought at Blenheim on the 13th August, 1704. By the Whigs the news was hailed with transports of joy and pride. No fault, no cause of quarrel, could be remembered by them against the Commander whose genius had, in one day, changed the face of Europe, saved the Imperial throne, humbled the House of Bourbon, and secured the Act of Settlement against foreign hostility. The feeling of the Tories was very different. They could not indeed, without imprudence, openly express regret at an event so glorious to their country; but their congratulations were so cold and sullen as to give deep disgust to the victorious general and his friends. Godolphin was not a reading man. Whatever time he could spare from business he was in the habit of spending at Newmarket or at the card-table. But he was not absolutely indifferent to poetry; and he was too intelligent an observer not to perceive that literature was a formidable engine of political warfare, and that the great Whig leaders had strengthened their party, and raised their character, by extending a liberal and judicious patronage to good writers. He was mortified, and not without reason, by the exceeding badness of the poems which appeared in honour of the battle of Blenheim. One of these poems has been rescued from oblivion by the exquisite absurdity of three lines: "Think of two thousand gentlemen at least, And each man mounted on his capering beast Into the Danube they were pushed by shoals." Where to procure better verses the Treasurer did not know. He understood how to negotiate a loan, or remit a subsidy: he was also well versed in the history of running horses and fighting cocks; but his acquaintance among the poets was very small. He consulted Halifax; but Halifax affected to decline the office of adviser. He had, he said, done his best, when he had power, to encourage men whose abilities and acquirements might do honour to their country. Those times were over. Other maxims had prevailed. Merit was suffered to pine in obscurity; and the public money was squandered on the undeserving. "I do know," he added, "a gentleman who would celebrate the battle in a manner worthy of the subject; but I will not name him." Godolphin, who was expert at the soft answer which turneth away wrath, and who was under the necessity of paying court to the Whigs, gently replied that there was too much ground for Halifax's complaints, but that what was amiss should in time be rectified, and that in the meantime the services of a man such as Halifax had described should be liberally rewarded. Halifax then mentioned Addison, but, mindful of the dignity as well as of the pecuniary interest of his friend, insisted that the Minister should apply in the most courteous manner to Addison himself; and this Godolphin promised to do. Addison then occupied a garret up three pair of stairs, over a small shop in the Haymarket. In this humble lodging he was surprised, on the morning which followed the conversation between Godolphin and Halifax, by a visit from no less a person than the Right Honourable Henry Boyle, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, and afterwards Lord Carleton. This highborn Minister had been sent by the Lord Treasurer as ambassador to the needy poet. Addison readily undertook the proposed task, a task which, to so good a Whig, was probably a pleasure. When the poem was little more than half finished, he showed it to Godolphin, who was delighted with it, and particularly with the famous similitude of the Angel. Addison was instantly appointed to a Commissionership worth about two hundred pounds a year, and was assured that this appointment was only an earnest of greater favours. The Campaign came forth, and was as much admired by the public as by the Minister. It pleases us less on the whole than the "Epistle to Halifax." Yet it undoubtedly ranks high among the poems which appeared during the interval between the death of Dryden and the dawn of Pope's genius. The chief merit of the Campaign, we think, is that which was noticed by Johnson, the manly and rational rejection of fiction. The first great poet whose works have come down to us sang of war long before war became a science or a trade. If, in his time, there was enmity between two little Greek towns, each poured forth its crowd of citizens, ignorant of discipline, and armed with implements of labour rudely turned into weapons. On each side appeared conspicuous a few chiefs, whose wealth had enabled them to procure good armour, horses, and chariots, and whose leisure had enabled them to practise military exercises. One such chief, if he were a man of great strength, agility, and courage, would probably be more formidable than twenty common men; and the force and dexterity with which he flung his spear might have no inconsiderable share in deciding the event of the day. Such were probably the battles with which Homer was familiar. But Homer related the actions of men of a former generation, of men who sprang from the Gods, and communed with the Gods face to face, of men, one of whom could with ease hurl rocks which two sturdy hinds of a later period would be unable even to lift. He therefore naturally represented their martial exploits as resembling in kind, but far surpassing in magnitude, those of the stoutest and most expert combatants of his own age. Achilles, clad in celestial armour, drawn by celestial coursers, grasping the spear which none but himself could raise, driving all Troy and Lycia before him, and choking Scamander with dead, was only a magnificent exaggeration of the real hero, who, strong, fearless, accustomed to the use of weapons, guarded by a shield and helmet of the best Sidonian fabric, and whirled along by horses of Thessalian breed, struck down with his own right arm foe after foe. In all rude societies similar notions are found. There are at this day countries where the Lifeguardsman Shaw would be considered as a much greater warrior than the Duke of Wellington. Buonaparte loved to describe the astonishment with which the Mamelukes looked at his diminutive figure. Mourad Bey, distinguished above all his fellows by his bodily strength, and by the skill with which he managed his horse and his sabre, could not believe that a man who was scarcely five feet high, and rode like a butcher, could be the greatest soldier in Europe. Homer's descriptions of war had therefore as much truth as poetry requires. But truth was altogether wanting to the performances of those who, writing about battles which had scarcely anything in common with the battles of his times, servilely imitated his manner. The folly of Silius Italicus, in particular, is positively nauseous. He undertook to record in verse the vicissitudes of a great struggle between generals of the first order; and his narrative is made up of the hideous wounds which these generals inflicted with their own hands. Asdrubal flings a spear which grazes the shoulder of the consul Nero; but Nero sends his spear into Asdrubal's side. Fabius slays Thuris and Butes and Maris and Arses, and the long-haired Adherbes, and the gigantic Thylis, and Sapharus and Monaesus, and the trumpeter Morinus. Hannibal runs Perusinus through the groin with a stake, and breaks the backbone of Telesinus with a huge stone. This detestable fashion was copied in modern times, and continued to prevail down to the age of Addison. Several versifiers had described William turning thousands to flight by his single prowess, and dyeing the Boyne with Irish blood. Nay, so estimable a writer as John Philips, the author of the Splendid Shilling, represented Marlborough as having won the battle of Blenheim merely by strength of muscle and skill in fence. The following lines may serve as an example:-              "Churchill viewing where The violence of Tallard most prevailed, Came to oppose his slaughtering arm. With speed precipitate he rode, urging his way O'er hills of gasping heroes, and fallen steeds Rolling in death. Destruction, grim with blood, Attends his furious course. Around his head The glowing balls play innocent, while he With dire impetuous sway deals fatal blows Among the flying Gauls. In Gallic blood He dyes his reeking sword, and strews the ground With headless ranks. What can they do? Or how Withstand his wide-destroying sword?" Addison, with excellent sense and taste, departed from this ridiculous fashion. He reserved his praise for the qualities which made Marlborough truly great, energy, sagacity, military science. But, above all, the poet extolled the firmness of that mind which, in the midst of confusion, uproar, and slaughter, examined and disposed everything with the serene wisdom of a higher intelligence. Here it was that he introduced the famous comparison of Marlborough to an angel guiding the whirlwind. We will not dispute the general justice of Johnson's remarks on this passage. But we must point out one circumstance which appears to have escaped all the critics. The extraordinary effect which this simile produced when it first appeared, and which to the following generation seemed inexplicable, is doubtless to be chiefly attributed to a line which most readers now regard as a feeble parenthesis:-- "Such as, of late, o'er pale Britannia pass'd." Addison spoke, not of a storm, but of the storm. The great tempest of November 1703, the only tempest which in our latitude has equalled the rage of a tropical hurricane, had left a dreadful recollection in the minds of all men. No other tempest was ever in this country the occasion of a parliamentary address or of a public fast. Whole fleets had been cast away. Large mansions had been blown down. One Prelate had been buried beneath the ruins of his palace. London and Bristol had presented the appearance of cities just sacked. Hundreds of families were still in mourning. The prostrate trunks of large trees, and the ruins of houses, still attested, in all the southern counties, the fury of the blast. The popularity which the simile of the angel enjoyed among Addison's contemporaries, has always seemed to us to be a remarkable instance of the advantage which, in rhetoric and poetry, the particular has over the general. Soon after the Campaign, was published Addison's Narrative of his Travels in Italy. The first effect produced by this Narrative was disappointment. The crowd of readers who expected politics and scandal, speculations on the projects of Victor Amadeus, and anecdotes about the jollities of convents and the amours of cardinals and nuns, were confounded by finding that the writer's mind was much more occupied by the war between the Trojans and Rutulians than by the war between France and Austria; and that he seemed to have heard no scandal of later date than the gallantries of the Empress Faustina. In time, however, the judgment of the many was overruled by that of the few; and, before the book was reprinted, it was so eagerly sought that it sold for five times the original price. It is still read with pleasure: the style is pure and flowing; the classical quotations and allusions are numerous and happy; and we are now and then charmed by that singularly humane and delicate humour in which Addison excelled all men. Yet this agreeable work, even when considered merely as the history of a literary tour, may justly be censured on account of its faults of omission. We have already said that, though rich in extracts from the Latin poets, it contains scarcely any references to the Latin orators and historians. We must add, that it contains little, or rather no information, respecting the history and literature of modern Italy. To the best of our remembrance, Addison does not mention Dante, Petrarch Boccaccio, Boiardo, Berni, Lorenzo de'Medici, or Machiavelli. He coldly tells us, that at Ferrara he saw the tomb of Ariosto, and that at Venice he heard the gondoliers sing verses of Tasso. But for Tasso and Ariosto he cared far less than for Valerius Flaccus and Sidonius Apollinaris. The gentle flow of the Ticin brings a line of Silius to his mind. The sulphurous stream of Albula suggests to him several passages of Martial. But he has not a word to say of the illustrious dead of Santa Croce; he crosses the wood of Ravenna without recollecting the Spectre Huntsman, and wanders up and down Rimini without one thought of Francesca. At Paris, he had eagerly sought an introduction to Boileau; but he seems not to have been at all aware that at Florence he was in the vicinity of a poet with whom Boileau could not sustain a comparison, of the greatest lyric poet of modern times, Vincenzio Filicaja. This is the more remarkable, because Filicaja was the favourite poet of the accomplished Somers, under whose protection Addison travelled, and to whom the account of the Travels is dedicated. The truth is, that Addison knew little, and cared less, about the literature of modern Italy. His favourite models were Latin, his favourite critics were French. Half the Tuscan poetry that he had read seemed to him monstrous, and the other half tawdry. His Travels were followed by the lively opera of Rosamond. This piece was ill set to music, and therefore failed on the stage, but it completely succeeded in print, and is indeed excellent in its kind. The smoothness with which the verses glide, and the elasticity with which they bound, is, to our ears at least, very pleasing. We are inclined to think that if Addison had left heroic couplets to Pope, and blank verse to Rowe, and had employed himself in writing airy and spirited songs, his reputation as a poet would have stood far higher than it now does. Some years after his death, Rosamond was set to new music by Doctor Arne; and was performed with complete success. Several passages long retained their popularity, and were daily sung, during the latter part of George the Second's reign, at all the harpsichords in England. While Addison thus amused himself, his prospects, and the prospects of his party, were constantly becoming brighter and brighter. In the spring of 1705, the Ministers were freed from the restraint imposed by a House of Commons in which Tories of the most perverse class had the ascendency. The elections were favourable to the Whigs. The coalition which had been tacitly and gradually formed was now openly avowed. The Great Seal was given to Cowper. Somers and Halifax were sworn of the Council. Halifax was sent in the following year to carry the decorations of the Order of the Garter to the Electoral Prince of Hanover, and was accompanied on this honourable mission by Addison, who had just been made Under-Secretary of State. The Secretary of State under whom Addison first served was Sir Charles Hedges, a Tory. But Hedges was soon dismissed, to make room for the most vehement of Whigs, Charles, Earl of Sunderland. In every department of the State, indeed, the High Churchmen were compelled to give place to their opponents. At the close of 1707, the Tories who still remained in office strove to rally, with Harley at their head. But the attempt, though favoured by the Queen, who had always been a Tory at heart, and who had now quarrelled with the Duchess of Marlborough, was unsuccessful. The time was not yet. The Captain-General was at the height of popularity and glory. The Low Church party had a majority in Parliament. The country squires and rectors, though occasionally uttering a savage growl, were for the most part in a state of torpor, which lasted till they were roused into activity, and indeed into madness, by the prosecution of Sacheverell. Harley and his adherents were compelled to retire. The victory of the Whigs was complete. At the general election of 1708, their strength in the House of Commons became irresistible; and, before the end of that year, Somers was made Lord President of the Council, and Wharton Lord- Lieutenant of Ireland. Addison sat for Malmsbury in the House of Commons which was elected in 1708. But the House of Commons was not the field for him. The bashfulness of his nature made his wit and eloquence useless in debate. He once rose, but could not overcome his diffidence, and ever after remained silent. Nobody can think it strange that a great writer should fail as a speaker. But many, probably, will think it strange that Addison's failure as a speaker should have had no unfavourable effect on his success as a politician. In our time, a man of high rank and great fortune might, though speaking very little and very ill, hold a considerable post. But it would now be inconceivable that a mere adventurer, a man who, when out of office, must live by his pen, should in a few years become successively Under-Secretary of State, Chief Secretary for Ireland, and Secretary of State, without some oratorical talent. Addison, without high birth, and with little property, rose to a post which Dukes the heads of the great Houses of Talbot, Russell, and Bentinck, have thought it an honour to fill. Without opening his lips in debate, he rose to a post, the highest that Chatham or Fox ever reached. And this he did before he had been nine years in Parliament. We must look for the explanation of this seeming miracle to the peculiar circumstances in which that generation was placed. During the interval which elapsed between the time when the Censorship of the Press ceased, and the time when parliamentary proceedings began to be freely reported, literary talents were, to a public man, of much more importance, and oratorical talents of much less importance, than in our time. At present, the best way of giving rapid and wide publicity to a fact or an argument is to introduce that fact or argument into a speech made in Parliament. If a political tract were to appear superior to the Conduct of the Allies, or to the best numbers of the Freeholder, the circulation of such a tract would be languid indeed when compared with the circulation of every remarkable word uttered in the deliberations of the legislature. A speech made in the House of Commons at four in the morning is on thirty thousand tables before ten. A speech made on the Monday is read on the Wednesday by multitudes in Antrim and Aberdeenshire. The orator, by the help of the shorthand writer, has to a great extent superseded the pamphleteer. It was not so in the reign of Anne. The best speech could then produce no effect except on those who heard it. It was only by means of the press that the opinion of the public without doors could be influenced: and the opinion of the public without doors could not but be of the highest importance in a country governed by parliaments, and indeed at that time governed by triennial parliaments. The pen was therefore a more formidable political engine than the tongue. Mr. Pitt and Mr. Fox contended only in Parliament. But Walpole and Pulteney, the Pitt and Fox of an earlier period, had not done half of what was necessary, when they sat down amidst the acclamations of the House of Commons. They had still to plead their cause before the country, and this they could do only by means of the press. Their works are now forgotten. But it is certain that there were in Grub Street few more assiduous scribblers of Thoughts, Letters, Answers, Remarks, than these two great chiefs of parties. Pulteney, when leader of the Opposition, and possessed of thirty thousand a year, edited the Craftsman. Walpole, though not a man of literary habits, was the author of at least ten pamphlets, and retouched and corrected many more. These facts sufficiently show of how great importance literary assistance then was to the contending parties. St. John was, certainly, in Anne's reign, the best Tory speaker; Cowper was probably the best Whig speaker. But it may well be doubted whether St. John did so much for the Tories as Swift, and whether Cowper did so much for the Whigs as Addison. When these things are duly considered, it will not be thought strange that Addison should have climbed higher in the State than any other Englishman has ever, by means merely of literary talents, been able to climb. Swift would, in all probability, have climbed as high, if he had not been encumbered by his cassock and his pudding sleeves. As far as the homage of the great went, Swift had as much of it as if he had been Lord Treasurer. To the influence which Addison derived from his literary talents was added all the influence which arises from character. The world, always ready to think the worst of needy political adventurers, was forced to make one exception. Restlessness, violence, audacity, laxity of principle, are the vices ordinarily attributed to that class of men. But faction itself could not deny that Addison had, through all changes of fortune, been strictly faithful to his early opinions, and to his early friends; that his integrity was without stain; that his whole deportment indicated a fine sense of the becoming; that, in the utmost heat of controversy, his zeal was tempered by a regard for truth, humanity, and social decorum; that no outrage could ever provoke him to retaliation unworthy of a Christian and a gentleman; and that his only faults were a too sensitive delicacy, and a modesty which amounted to bashfulness. He was undoubtedly one of the most popular men of his time; and much of his popularity he owed, we believe, to that very timidity which his friends lamented. That timidity often prevented him from exhibiting his talents to the best advantage. But it propitiated Nemesis. It averted that envy which would otherwise have been excited by fame so splendid and by so rapid an elevation. No man is so great a favourite with the Public as he who is at once an object of admiration, of respect and of pity; and such were the feelings which Addison inspired. Those who enjoyed the privilege of hearing his familiar conversation, declared with one voice that it was superior even to his writings. The brilliant Mary Montague said, that she had known all the wits, and that Addison was the best company in the world. The malignant Pope was forced to own, that there was a charm in Addison's talk, which could be found nowhere else. Swift, when burning with animosity against the Whigs, could not but confess to Stella that, after all, he had never known any associate so agreeable as Addison. Steele, an excellent judge of lively conversation, said that the conversation of Addison was at once the most polite, and the most mirthful, that could be imagined; that it was Terence and Catullus in one, heightened by an exquisite something which was neither Terence nor Catullus, but Addison alone. Young, an excellent judge of serious conversation, said, that when Addison was at his ease, he went on in a noble strain of thought and language, so as to chain the attention of every hearer. Nor were Addison's great colloquial powers more admirable than the courtesy and softness of heart which appeared in his conversation. At the same time, it would be too much to say that he was wholly devoid of the malice which is, perhaps, inseparable from a keen sense of the ludicrous. He had one habit which both Swift and Stella applauded, and which we hardly know how to blame. If his first attempts to set a presuming dunce right were ill received, he changed his tone, "assented with civil leer," and lured the flattered coxcomb deeper and deeper into absurdity. That such was his practice, we should, we think, have guessed from his works. The Tatler's criticisms on Mr. Softly's sonnet and the Spectator's dialogue with the politician who is so zealous for the honour of Lady Q--p--t--s, are excellent specimens of this innocent mischief. Such were Addison's talents for conversation. But his rare gifts were not exhibited to crowds or to strangers. As soon as he entered a large company, as soon as he saw an unknown face, his lips were sealed and his manners became constrained. None who met him only in great assemblies would have been able to believe that he was the same man who had often kept a few friends listening and laughing round a table, from the time when the play ended, till the clock of St. Paul's in Covent Garden struck four. Yet, even at such a table, he was not seen to the best advantage. To enjoy his conversation in the highest perfection, it was necessary to be alone with him, and to hear him, in his own phrase, think aloud. "There is no such thing," he used to say, "as real conversation, but between two persons." This timidity, a timidity surely neither ungraceful nor unamiable, led Addison into the two most serious faults which can with justice be imputed to him. He found that wine broke the spell which lay on his fine intellect, and was therefore too easily seduced into convivial excess. Such excess was in that age regarded, even by grave men, as the most venial of all peccadilloes, and was so far from being a mark of ill-breeding, that it was almost essential to the character of a fine gentleman. But the smallest speck is seen on a white ground; and almost all the biographers of Addison have said something about this failing. Of any other statesman or writer of Queen Anne's reign, we should no more think of saying that he sometimes took too much wine, than that he wore a long wig and a sword. To the excessive modesty of Addison's nature, we must ascribe another fault which generally arises from a very different cause. He became a little too fond of seeing himself surrounded by a small circle of admirers, to whom he was as a King or rather as a God. All these men were far inferior to him in ability, and some of them had very serious faults. Nor did those faults escape his observation; for, if ever there was an eye which saw through and through men, it was the eye of Addison. But, with the keenest observation, and the finest sense of the ridiculous, he had a large charity. The feeling with which he looked on most of his humble companions was one of benevolence, slightly tinctured with contempt. He was at perfect case in their company; he was grateful for their devoted attachment; and he loaded them with benefits. Their veneration for him appears to have exceeded that with which Johnson was regarded by Boswell, or Warburton by Hurd. It was not in the power of adulation to turn such a head, or deprave such a heart, as Addison's. But it must in candour be admitted that he contracted some of the faults which can scarcely be avoided by any person who is so unfortunate as to be the oracle of a small literary coterie. One member of this little society was Eustace Budgell, a young Templar of some literature, and a distant relation of Addison. There was at this time no stain on the character of Budgell, and it is not improbable that his career would have been prosperous and honourable, if the life of his cousin had been prolonged. But when the master was laid in the grave, the disciple broke loose from all restraint, descended rapidly from one degree of vice and misery to another, ruined his fortune by follies, attempted to repair it by crimes, and at length closed a wicked and unhappy life by self-murder. Yet, to the last, the wretched man, gambler, lampooner, cheat, forger, as he was, retained his affection and veneration for Addison, and recorded those feelings in the last lines which he traced before he hid himself from infamy under London Bridge. Another of Addison's favourite companions was Ambrose Phillips, a good Whig and a middling poet, who had the honour of bringing into fashion a species of composition which has been called, after his name, Namby Pamby. But the most remarkable members of the little senate, as Pope long afterwards called it, were Richard Steele and Thomas Tickell. Steele had known Addison from childhood. They had been together at the Charterhouse and at Oxford; but circumstances had then, for a time, separated them widely. Steele had left college without taking a degree, had been disinherited by a rich relation, had led a vagrant life, had served in the army, had tried to find the philosopher's stone, and had written a religious treatise and several comedies. He was one of those people whom it is impossible either to hate or to respect. His temper was sweet, his affections warm, his spirits lively, his passions strong, and his principles weak. His life was spent in sinning and repenting; in inculcating what was right, and doing what was wrong. In speculation, he was a man of piety and honour; in practice, he was much of the rake and a little of the swindler. He was, however, so good-natured that it was not easy to be seriously angry with him, and that even rigid moralists felt more inclined to pity than to blame him, when he diced himself into a spunging-house or drank himself into a fever. Addison regarded Steele with kindness not unmingled with scorn, tried, with little success, to keep him out of scrapes, introduced him to the great, procured a good place for him, corrected his plays, and, though by no means rich, lent him large sums of money. One of these loans appears, from a letter dated in August 1708, to have amounted to a thousand pounds. These pecuniary transactions probably led to frequent bickerings. It is said that, on one occasion, Steele's negligence, or dishonesty, provoked Addison to repay himself by the help of a bailiff. We cannot join with Miss Aikin in rejecting this story. Johnson heard it from Savage, who heard it from Steele. Few private transactions which took place a hundred and twenty years ago, are proved by stronger evidence than this. But we can by no means agree with those who condemn Addison's severity. The most amiable of mankind may well be moved to indignation, when what he has earned hardly, and lent with great inconvenience to himself, for the purpose of relieving a friend in distress, is squandered with insane profusion. We will illustrate our meaning by an example, which is not the less striking because it is taken from fiction. Dr. Harrison, in Fielding's Amelia, is represented as the most benevolent of human beings; yet he takes in execution, not only the goods, but the person of his friend Booth. Dr. Harrison resorts to this strong measure because he has been informed that Booth, while pleading poverty as an excuse for not paying just debts has been buying fine jewellery, and setting up a coach. No person who is well acquainted with Steele's life and correspondence can doubt that he behaved quite as ill to Addison as Booth was accused of behaving to Dr. Harrison. The real history, we have little doubt, was something like this:--A letter comes to Addison, imploring help in pathetic terms, and promising reformation and speedy repayment. Poor Dick declares that he has not an inch of candle, or a bushel of coals, or credit with the butcher for a shoulder of mutton. Addison is moved. He determines to deny himself some medals which are wanting to his series of the twelve Caesars; to put off buying the new edition of Bayle's Dictionary; and to wear his old sword and buckles another year. In this way he manages to send a hundred pounds to his friend. The next day he calls on Steele, and finds scores of gentlemen and ladies assembled. The fiddles are playing. The table is groaning under Champagne, Burgundy, and pyramids of sweetmeats. Is it strange that a man whose kindness is thus abused, should send sheriff's officers to reclaim what is due to him? Tickell was a young man, fresh from Oxford, who had introduced himself to public notice by writing a most ingenious and graceful little poem in praise of the opera of Rosamond. He deserved, and at length attained, the first place in Addison's friendship. For a time Steele and Tickell were on good terms. But they loved Addison too much to love each other, and at length became as bitter enemies as the rival bulls in Virgil. At the close of 1708 Wharton became Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, and appointed Addison Chief Secretary. Addison was consequently under the necessity of quitting London for Dublin. Besides the chief secretaryship, which was then worth about two thousand pounds a year, he obtained a patent appointing him keeper of the Irish Records for life, with a salary of three or four hundred a year. Budgell accompanied his cousin in the capacity of private secretary. Wharton and Addison had nothing in common but Whiggism. The Lord- Lieutenant was not only licentious and corrupt, but was distinguished from other libertines and jobbers by a callous impudence which presented the strongest contrast to the Secretary's gentleness and delicacy. Many parts of the Irish administration at this time appear to have deserved serious blame. But against Addison there was not a murmur. He long afterwards asserted, what all the evidence which we have ever seen tends to prove, that his diligence and integrity gained the friendship of all the most considerable persons in Ireland. The parliamentary career of Addison in Ireland has, we think, wholly escaped the notice of all his biographers. He was elected member for the borough of Cavan in the summer of 1709; and in the journals of two sessions his name frequently occurs. Some of the entries appear to indicate that he so far overcame his timidity as to make speeches. Nor is this by any means improbable; for the Irish House of Commons was a far less formidable audience than the English House; and many tongues which were tied by fear in the greater assembly became fluent in the smaller. Gerard Hamilton, for example, who, from fear of losing the fame gained by his single speech, sat mute at Westminster during forty years, spoke with great effect at Dublin when he was Secretary to Lord Halifax. While Addison was in Ireland, an event occurred to which he owes his high and permanent rank among British writers. As yet his fame rested on performances which, though highly respectable, were not built for duration, and which would, if he had produced nothing else, have now been almost forgotten, on some excellent Latin verses, on some English verses which occasionally rose above mediocrity, and on a book of travels, agreeably written, but not indicating any extraordinary powers of mind. These works showed him to be a man of taste, sense, and learning. The time had come when he was to prove himself a man of genius, and to enrich our literature with compositions which will live as long as the English language. In the spring of 1709 Steele formed a literary project, of which he was far indeed from foreseeing the consequences. Periodical papers had during many years been published in London. Most of these were political; but in some of them questions of morality, taste, and love casuistry had been discussed. The literary merit of these works was small indeed; and even their names are now known only to the curious. Steele had been appointed Gazetteer by Sunderland, at the request, it is said, of Addison, and thus had access to foreign intelligence earlier and more authentic than was in those times within the reach of an ordinary news-writer. This circumstance seems to have suggested to him the scheme of publishing a periodical paper on a new plan. It was to appear on the days on which the post left London for the country, which were, in that generation, the Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. It was to contain the foreign news, accounts of theatrical representations, and the literary gossip of Will's and of the Grecian. It was also to contain remarks on the fashionable topics of the day, compliments to beauties, pasquinades on noted sharpers, and criticisms on popular preachers. The aim of Steele does not appear to have been at first higher than this. He was not ill qualified to conduct the work which he had planned. His public intelligence he drew from the best sources. He knew the town, and had paid dear for his knowledge. He had read much more than the dissipated men of that time were in the habit of reading. He was a rake among scholars, and a scholar among rakes. His style was easy and not incorrect; and, though his wit and humour were of no high order, his gay animal spirits imparted to his compositions an air of vivacity which ordinary readers could hardly distinguish from comic genius. His writings have been well compared to those light wines which, though deficient in body and flavour, are yet a pleasant small drink, if not kept too long, or carried too far. Isaac Bickerstaff, Esquire, Astrologer, was an imaginary person, almost as well known in that age as Mr. Paul Pry or Mr. Samuel Pickwick in ours. Swift had assumed the name of Bickerstaff in a satirical pamphlet against Partridge, the maker of almanacks. Partridge had been fool enough to publish a furious reply. Bickerstaff had rejoined in a second pamphlet still more diverting than the first. All the wits had combined to keep up the joke, and the town was long in convulsions of laughter. Steele determined to employ the name which this controversy had made popular; and, in 1709, it was announced that Isaac Bickerstaff, Esquire, Astrologer, was about to publish a paper called the Tatler. Addison had not been consulted about this scheme: but as soon as he heard of it, he determined to give his assistance. The effect of that assistance cannot be better described than in Steele's own words. "I fared," he said, "like a distressed prince who calls in a powerful neighbour to his aid. I was undone by my auxiliary. When I had once called him in, I could not subsist without dependence on him." "The paper," he says elsewhere, "was advanced indeed. It was raised to a greater thing than I intended it." It is probable that Addison, when he sent across St. George's channel his first contributions to the Tatler, had no notion of the extent and variety of his own powers. He was the possessor of a vast mine, rich with a hundred ores. But he had been acquainted only with the least precious part of his treasures, and had hitherto contented himself with producing sometimes copper and sometimes lead, intermingled with a little silver. All at once, and by mere accident, he had lighted on an inexhaustible vein of the finest gold. The mere choice and arrangement of his words would have sufficed to make his essays classical. For never, not even by Dryden, not even by Temple, had the English language been written with such sweetness, grace, and facility. But this was the smallest part of Addison's praise. Had he clothed his thoughts in the half French style of Horace Walpole, or in the half Latin style of Dr. Johnson, or in the half German jargon of the present day, his genius would have triumphed over all faults of manner. As a moral satirist he stands unrivalled. If ever the best Tatlers and Spectators were equalled in their own kind, we should be inclined to guess that it must have been by the lost comedies of Menander. In wit properly so called, Addison was not inferior to Cowley or Butler. No single ode of Cowley contains so many happy analogies as are crowded into the lines to Sir Godfrey Kneller; and we would undertake to collect from the Spectators as great a number of ingenious illustrations as can be found in Hudibras. The still higher faculty of invention Addison possessed in still larger measure. The numerous fictions, generally original, often wild and grotesque, but always singularly graceful and happy, which are found in his essays, fully entitle him to the rank of a great poet, a rank to which his metrical compositions give him no claim. As an observer of life, of manners, of all the shades of human character, he stands in the first class. And what he observed he had the art of communicating in two widely different ways. He could describe virtues, vices, habits, whims, as well as Clarendon. But he could do something better. He could call human beings into existence, and make them exhibit themselves. If we wish to find anything more vivid than Addison's best portraits, we must go either to Shakspeare or to Cervantes. But what shall we say of Addison's humour, of his sense of the ludicrous, of his power of awakening that sense in others, and of drawing mirth from incidents which occur every day, and from little peculiarities of temper and manner, such as may be found in every man? We feel the charm: we give ourselves up to it; but we strive in vain to analyse it. Perhaps the best way of describing Addison's peculiar pleasantry is to compare it with the pleasantry of some other great satirists. The three most eminent masters of the art of ridicule, during the eighteenth century, were, we conceive, Addison, Swift, and Voltaire. Which of the three had the greatest power of moving laughter may be questioned. But each of them, within his own domain, was supreme. Voltaire is the prince of buffoons. His merriment is without disguise or restraint. He gambols; he grins; he shakes his sides; he points the finger; he turns up the nose; he shoots out the tongue. The manner of Swift is the very opposite to this. He moves laughter, but never joins in it. He appears in his works such as he appeared in society. All the company are convulsed with merriment, while the Dean, the author of all the mirth, preserves an invincible gravity, and even sourness of aspect, and gives utterance to the most eccentric and ludicrous fancies, with the air of a man reading the commination service. The manner of Addison is as remote from that of Swift as from that of Voltaire. He neither laughs out like the French wit, nor, like the Irish wit, throws a double portion of severity into his countenance while laughing inwardly; but preserves a look peculiarly his own, a look of demure serenity, disturbed only by an arch sparkle of the eye, an almost imperceptible elevation of the brow, an almost imperceptible curl of the lip. His tone is never that either of a Jack Pudding or of a Cynic. It is that of a gentleman, in whom the quickest sense of the ridiculous is constantly tempered by good nature and good breeding. We own that the humour of Addison is, in our opinion, of a more delicious flavour than the humour of either Swift or Voltaire. Thus much, at least, is certain, that both Swift and Voltaire have been successfully mimicked, and that no man has yet been able to mimic Addison. The letter of the Abbe Coyer to Pansophe is Voltaire all over, and imposed, during a long time, on the Academicians of Paris. There are passages in Arbuthnot's satirical works which we, at least, cannot distinguish from Swift's best writing. But of the many eminent men who have made Addison their model, though several have copied his mere diction with happy effect, none has been able to catch the tone of his pleasantry. In the World, in the Connoisseur, in the Mirror, in the Lounger, there are numerous Papers written in obvious imitation of his Tatlers and Spectators. Most of those papers have some merit; many are very lively and amusing; but there is not a single one which could be passed off as Addison's on a critic of the smallest perspicacity. But that which chiefly distinguishes Addison from Swift, from Voltaire, from almost all the other great masters of ridicule, is the grace, the nobleness, the moral purity, which we find even in his merriment. Severity, gradually hardening and darkening into misanthropy, characterises the works of Swift. The nature of Voltaire was, indeed, not inhuman; but he venerated nothing. Neither in the masterpieces of art nor in the purest examples of virtue, neither in the Great First Cause nor in the awful enigma of the grave, could he see anything but subjects for drollery. The more solemn and august the theme, the more monkey-like was his grimacing and chattering. The mirth of Swift is the mirth of Mephistopheles; the mirth of Voltaire is the mirth of Puck. If, as, Soame Jenyns oddly imagined, a portion of the happiness of Seraphim and just men made perfect be derived from an exquisite perception of the ludicrous, their mirth must surely be none other than the mirth of Addison; a mirth consistent with tender compassion for all that is frail, and with profound reverence for all that is sublime. Nothing great, nothing amiable, no moral duty, no doctrine of natural or revealed religion, has ever been associated by Addison with any degrading idea. His humanity is without a parallel in literary history. The highest proof of virtue is to possess boundless power without abusing it. No kind of power is more formidable than the power of making men ridiculous; and that power Addison possessed in boundless measure. How grossly that power was abused by Swift and by Voltaire is well known. But of Addison it may be confidently affirmed that he has blackened no man's character, nay, that it would be difficult if not impossible, to find in all the volumes which he has left us a single taunt which can be called ungenerous or unkind. Yet he had detractors, whose malignity might have seemed to justify as terrible a revenge as that which men, not superior to him in genius, wreaked on Bettesworth and on Franc de Pompignan. He was a politician; he was the best writer of his party; he lived in times of fierce excitement, in times when persons of high character and station stooped to scurrility such as is now practised only by the basest of mankind. Yet no provocation and no example could induce him to return railing for railing. On the service which his Essays rendered to morality it is difficult to speak too highly. It is true that, when the Tatler appeared, that age of outrageous profaneness and licentiousness which followed the Restoration had passed away. Jeremy Collier had shamed the theatres into something which, compared with the excesses of Etherege and Wycherley, might be called decency. Yet there still lingered in the public mind a pernicious notion that there was some connection between genius and profligacy, between the domestic virtues and the sullen formality of the Puritans. That error it is the glory of Addison to have dispelled. He taught the nation that the faith and the morality of Hale and Tillotson might be found in company with wit more sparkling than the wit of Congreve, and with humour richer than the humour of Vanbrugh. So effectually indeed, did he retort on vice the mockery which had recently been directed against virtue, that, since his time, the open violation of decency has always been considered among us as the mark of a fool. And this revolution, the greatest and most salutary ever effected by any satirist, he accomplished, be it remembered, without writing one personal lampoon. In the earlier contributions of Addison to the Tatler his peculiar powers were not fully exhibited. Yet from the first, his superiority to all his coadjutors was evident. Some of his later Tatlers are fully equal to anything that he ever wrote. Among the portraits we most admire "Tom Folio," "Ned Softly," and the "Political Upholsterer." "The Proceedings of the Court of Honour," the "Thermometer of Zeal," the story of the "Frozen Words," the "Memoirs of the Shilling," are excellent specimens of that ingenious and lively species of fiction in which Addison excelled all men. There is one still better paper of the same class. But though that paper, a hundred and thirty-three years ago, was probably thought as edifying as one of Smalridge's sermons, we dare not indicate it to the squeamish readers of the nineteenth century. During the session of Parliament which commenced in November 1709, and which the impeachment of Sacheverell has made memorable, Addison appears to have resided in London, The Tatler was now more popular than any periodical paper had ever been; and his connection with it was generally known. It was not known, however, that almost everything good in the Tatler was his. The truth is, that the fifty or sixty numbers which we owe to him were not merely the best, but so decidedly the best that any five of them are more valuable than all the two hundred numbers in which he had no share. He required, at this time, all the solace which he could derive from literary success. The Queen had always disliked the Whigs. She had during some years disliked the Marlborough family. But, reigning by a disputed title, she could not venture directly to oppose herself to a majority of both Houses of Parliament; and, engaged as she was in a war on the event of which her own Crown was staked, she could not venture to disgrace a great and successful general. But at length, in the year 1710, the causes which had restrained her from showing her aversion to the Low Church party ceased to operate. The trial of Sacheverell produced an outbreak of public feeling scarcely less violent than the outbreaks which we can ourselves remember in 1820 and 1831. The country gentlemen, the country clergymen, the rabble of the towns, were all, for once, on the same side. It was clear that, if a general election took place before the excitement abated, the Tories would have a majority. The services of Marlborough had been so splendid that they were no longer necessary. The Queen's throne was secure from all attack on the part of Lewis. Indeed, it seemed much more likely that the English and German armies would divide the spoils of Versailles and Marli than that a Marshal of France would bring back the Pretender to St. James's. The Queen, acting by the advice of Harley, determined to dismiss her servants. In June the change commenced. Sunderland was the first who fell. The Tories exulted over his fall. The Whigs tried, during a few weeks, to persuade themselves that her Majesty had acted only from personal dislike to the Secretary, and that she meditated no further alteration. But, early in August, Godolphin was surprised by a letter from Anne, which directed him to break his white staff. Even after this event, the irresolution or dissimulation of Harley kept up the hopes of the Whigs during another month; and then the ruin became rapid and violent. The Parliament was dissolved. The Ministers were turned out. The Tories were called to office. The tide of popularity ran violently in favour of the High Church party. That party, feeble in the late House of Commons, was now irresistible. The power which the Tories had thus suddenly acquired, they used with blind and stupid ferocity. The howl which the whole pack set up for prey and for blood appalled even him who had roused and unchained them. When, at this distance of time, we calmly review the conduct of the discarded Ministers, we cannot but feel a movement of indignation at the injustice with which they were treated. No body of men had ever administered the Government with more energy, ability, and moderation; and their success had been proportioned to their wisdom. They had saved Holland and Germany. They had humbled France. They had, as it seemed, all but torn Spain from the House of Bourbon. They had made England the first power in Europe. At home they had united England and Scotland. They had respected the rights of conscience and the liberty of the subject. They retired, leaving their country at the height of prosperity and glory. And yet they were pursued to their retreat by such a roar of obloquy as was never raised against the Government which threw away thirteen colonies, or against the Government which sent a gallant army to perish in the ditches of Walcheren. None of the Whigs suffered more in the general wreck than Addison. He had just sustained some heavy pecuniary losses, of the nature of which we are imperfectly informed, when the Secretaryship was taken from him. He had reason to believe that he should also be deprived of the small Irish office which he held by patent. He had just resigned his Fellowship. It seems probable that he had already ventured to raise his eyes to a great lady, and that, while his political friends were in power, and while his own fortunes were rising, he had been, in the phrase of the romances which were then fashionable, permitted to hope. But Mr. Addison the ingenious writer, and Mr. Addison the Chief Secretary, were, in her ladyship's opinion, two very different persons. All these calamities united, however, could not disturb the serene cheerfulness of a mind conscious of innocence, and rich in its own wealth. He told his friends, with smiling resignation, that they ought to admire his philosophy, that he had lost at once his fortune, his place, his Fellowship, and his mistress, that he must think of turning tutor again, and yet that his spirits were as good as ever. He had one consolation. Of the unpopularity which his friends had incurred, he had no share. Such was the esteem with which he was regarded that, while the most violent measures were taken for the purpose of forcing Tory members on Whig corporations, he was returned to Parliament without even a contest. Swift, who was now in London, and who had already determined on quitting the Whigs, wrote to Stella in these remarkable words. "The Tories carry it among the new members six to one. Mr. Addison's election has passed easy and undisputed; and I believe if he had a mind to be king he would hardly be refused." The goodwill with which the Tories regarded Addison is the more honourable to him, because it had not been purchased by any concession on his part. During the general election he published a political journal, entitled the Whig Examiner. Of that journal it may be sufficient to say that Johnson, in spite of his strong political prejudices, pronounced it to be superior in wit to any of Swift's writings on the other side. When it ceased to appear, Swift, in a letter to Stella, expressed his exultation at the death of so formidable an antagonist. "He might well rejoice," says Johnson, "at the death of that which he could not have killed." "On no occasion," he adds, "was the genius of Addison more vigorously exerted, and on none did the superiority of his powers more evidently appear." The only use which Addison appears to have made of the favour with which he was regarded by the Tories was to save some of his friends from the general ruin of the Whig party. He felt himself to be in a situation which made it his duty to take a decided part in politics. But the case of Steele and of Ambrose Phillips was different. For Phillips, Addison even condescended to solicit, with what success we have not ascertained. Steele held two places. He was Gazetteer, and he was also a Commissioner of Stamps. The Gazette was taken from him. But he was suffered to retain his place in the Stamp Office, on an implied understanding that he should not be active against the new Government; and he was, during more than two years, induced by Addison to observe this armistice with tolerable fidelity. Isaac Bickerstaff accordingly became silent on politics, and the article of news which had once formed about one-third of his paper, altogether disappeared. The Tatler had completely changed its character. It was now nothing but a series of essays on books, morals, and manners. Steele therefore resolved to bring it to a close, and to commence a new work on an improved plan. It was announced that this new work would be published daily. The undertaking was generally regarded as bold, or rather rash; but the event amply justified, the confidence with which Steele relied on the fertility of Addison's genius. On the second of January 1711, appeared the last Tatler. At the beginning of March following appeared the first of an incomparable series of papers containing observations on life and literature by an imaginary Spectator. The Spectator himself was conceived and drawn by Addison; and it is not easy to doubt that the portrait was meant to be in some features a likeness of the painter. The Spectator is a gentleman who, after passing a studious youth at the university, has travelled on classic ground, and has bestowed much attention on curious points of antiquity. He has, on his return, fixed his residence in London, and has observed all the forms of life which are to be found in that great city, has daily listened to the wits of Will's, has smoked with the philosophers of the Grecian, and has mingled with the parsons at Child's, and with the politicians at the St. James's. In the morning, he often listens to the hum of the Exchange; in the evening, his face is constantly to be seen in the pit of Drury Lane Theatre. But an insurmountable bashfulness prevents him from opening his mouth, except in a small circle of intimate friends. These friends were first sketched by Steele. Four of the club, the templar, the clergyman, the soldier, and the merchant, were uninteresting figures, fit only for a background. But the other two, an old country baronet and an old town rake, though not delineated with a very delicate pencil, had some good strokes. Addison took the rude outlines into his own hands, retouched them, coloured them, and is in truth the creator of the Sir Roger de Coverley and the Will Honeycomb with whom we are all familiar. The plan of the Spectator must be allowed to be both original and eminently happy. Every valuable essay in the series may be read with pleasure separately; yet the five or six hundred essays form a whole, and a whole which has the interest of a novel. It must be remembered, too, that at that time no novel, giving a lively and powerful picture of the common life and manners of England, had appeared. Richardson was working as a compositor. Fielding was robbing birds' nests. Smollett was not yet born. The narrative, therefore, which connects together the Spectator's Essays, gave to our ancestors their first taste of an exquisite and untried pleasure. That narrative was indeed constructed with no art or labour. The events were such events as occur every day. Sir Roger comes up to town to see Eugenio, as the worthy baronet always called Prince Eugene, goes with the Spectator on the water to Spring Gardens, walks among the tombs in the Abbey, and is frightened by the Mohawks, but conquers his apprehension so far as to go to the theatre when the Distressed Mother is acted. The Spectator pays a visit in the summer to Coverley Hall, is charmed with the old house, the old butler, and the old chaplain, eats a jack caught by Will Wimble, rides to the assizes, and hears a point of law discussed by Tom Touchy. At last a letter from the honest butler brings to the club the news that Sir Roger is dead. Will Honeycomb marries and reforms at sixty. The club breaks up; and the Spectator resigns his functions. Such events can hardly be said to form a plot; yet they are related with such truth, such grace, such wit, such humour, such pathos, such knowledge of the human heart, such knowledge of the ways of the world, that they charm us on the hundredth perusal. We have not the least doubt that if Addison had written a novel on an extensive plan, it would have been superior to any that we possess. As it is, he is entitled to be considered, not only as the greatest of the English essayists, but as the forerunner of the greatest English novelists. We say this of Addison alone; for Addison is the Spectator. About three-sevenths of the work are his; and it is no exaggeration to say, that his worst essay is as good as the best essay of his coadjutors. His best essays approach near to absolute perfection; nor is their excellence more wonderful than their variety. His invention never seems to flag; nor is he ever under the necessity of repeating himself, or of wearing out a subject. There are no dregs in his wine. He regales us after the fashion of that prodigal nabob who held that there was only one good glass in a bottle. As soon as we have tasted the first sparkling foam of a jest, it is withdrawn, and a fresh draught of nectar is at our lips. On the Monday we have an allegory as lively and ingenious as Lucian's Auction of Lives; on the Tuesday an Eastern apologue, as richly coloured as the Tales of Scherezade; on the Wednesday, a character described with the skill of La Bruyere; on the Thursday, a scene from common life, equal to the best chapters in the Vicar of Wakefield; on the Friday, some sly Horatian pleasantry on fashionable follies, on hoops, patches, or puppet shows; and on the Saturday a religious meditation, which will bear a comparison with the finest passages in Massillon. It is dangerous to select where there is so much that deserves the highest praise. We will venture, however, to say, that any person who wishes to form a just notion of the extent and variety of Addison's powers, will do well to read at one sitting the following papers, the two " Visits to the Abbey," the "Visit to the Exchange," the "Journal of the Retired Citizen," the "Vision of Mirza," the "Transmigrations of Pug the Monkey," and the "Death of Sir Roger de Coverley." [Nos. 26, 329, 69, 317, 159, 343, 517. These papers are all in the first seven volumes. The eighth must be considered as a separate work.] The least valuable of Addison's contributions to the Spectator are, in the judgment of our age, his critical papers. Yet his critical papers are always luminous, and often ingenious. The very worst of them must be regarded as creditable to him, when the character of the school in which he had been trained is fairly considered. The best of them were much too good for his readers. In truth, he was not so far behind our generation as he was before his own. No essays in the Spectator were more censured and derided than those in which he raised his voice against the contempt with which our fine old ballads were regarded, and showed the scoffers that the same gold which, burnished and polished, gives lustre to the Aeneid and the Odes of Horace, is mingled with the rude dross of Chevy Chace. It is not strange that the success of the Spectator should have been such as no similar work has ever obtained. The number of copies daily distributed was at first three thousand. It subsequently increased, and had risen to near four thousand when the stamp tax was imposed. The tax was fatal to a crowd of journals. The Spectator, however, stood its ground, doubled its price, and, though its circulation fell off, still yielded a large revenue both to the State and to the authors. For particular papers, the demand was immense; of some, it is said, twenty thousand copies were required. But this was not all. To have the  Spectator served up every morning with the bohea and rolls was a luxury for the few. The majority were content to wait till essays enough had appeared to form a volume. Ten thousand copies of each volume were immediately taken off, and new editions were called for. It must be remembered, that the population of England was then hardly a third of what it now is. The number of Englishmen who were in the habit of reading, was probably not a sixth of what it now is. A shopkeeper or a farmer who found any pleasure in literature, was a rarity. Nay, there was doubtless more than one knight of the shire whose country seat did not contain ten books, receipt books and books on farriery included. In these circumstances, the sale of the Spectator must be considered as indicating a popularity quite as great as that of the most successful works of Sir Walter Scott and Mr. Dickens in our own time. At the close of 1712 the Spectator ceased to appear. It was probably felt that the short-faced gentleman and his club had been long enough before the town; and that it was time to withdraw them, and to replace them by a new set of characters. In a few weeks the first number of the Guardian was published. But the Guardian was unfortunate both in its birth and in its death. It began in dulness, and disappeared in a tempest of faction. The original plan was bad. Addison contributed nothing till sixty-six numbers had appeared; and it was then impossible to make the Guardian what the Spectator had been. Nestor Ironside and the Miss Lizards were people to whom even he could impart no interest. He could only furnish some excellent little essays, both serious and comic; and this he did. Why Addison gave no assistance to the Guardian, during the first two months of its existence is a question which has puzzled the editors and biographers, but which seems to us to admit of a very easy solution. He was then engaged in bringing his Cato on the stage. The first four acts of this drama had been lying in his desk since his return from Italy. His modest and sensitive nature shrank from the risk of a public and shameful failure; and, though all who saw the manuscript were loud in praise, some thought it possible that an audience might become impatient even of very good rhetoric, and advised Addison to print the play without hazarding a representation. At length, after many fits of apprehension, the poet yielded to the urgency of his political friends, who hoped that the public would discover some analogy between the followers of Caesar and the Tories, between Sempronius and the apostate Whigs, between Cato, struggling to the last for the liberties of Rome, and the band of patriots who still stood firm around Halifax and Wharton. Addison gave the play to the managers of Drury Lane Theatre, without stipulating for any advantage to himself. They, therefore, thought themselves bound to spare no cost in scenery and dresses. The decorations, it is true, would not have pleased the skilful eye of Mr. Macready. Juba's waistcoat blazed with gold lace; Marcia's hoop was worthy of a Duchess on the birthday; and Cato wore a wig worth fifty guineas. The prologue was written by Pope, and is undoubtedly a dignified and spirited composition. The part of the hero was excellently played by Booth. Steele undertook to pack a house. The boxes were in a blaze with the stars of the Peers in Opposition. The pit was crowded with attentive and friendly listeners from the Inns of Court and the literary coffee-houses. Sir Gilbert Heathcote, Governor of the Bank of England, was at the head of a powerful body of auxiliaries from the city, warm men and true Whigs, but better known at Jonathan's and Garraway's than in the haunts of wits and critics. These precautions were quite superfluous. The Tories, as a body, regarded Addison with no unkind feelings. Nor was it for their interest, professing, as they did, profound reverence for law and prescription, and abhorrence both of popular insurrections and of standing armies, to appropriate to themselves reflections thrown on the great military chief and demagogue, who, with the support of the legions and of the common people, subverted all the ancient institutions of his country. Accordingly, every shout that was raised by the members of the Kit Cat was echoed by the High Churchmen of the October; and the curtain at length fell amidst thunders of unanimous applause. The delight and admiration of the town were described by the Guardian in terms which we might attribute to partiality, were it not that the Examiner, the organ of the Ministry, held similar language. The Tories, indeed, found much to sneer at in the conduct of their opponents. Steele had on this, as on other occasions, shown more zeal than taste or judgment. The honest citizens who marched under the orders of Sir Gibby, as he was facetiously called, probably knew better when to buy and when to sell stock than when to clap and when to hiss at a play, and incurred some ridicule by making the hypocritical Sempronius their favourite, and by giving to his insincere rants louder plaudits than they bestowed on the temperate eloquence of Cato. Wharton, too, who had the incredible effrontery to applaud the lines about flying from prosperous vice and from the power of impious men to a private station, did not escape the sarcasms of those who justly thought that he could fly from nothing more vicious or impious than himself. The epilogue, which was written by Garth, a zealous Whig, was severely and not unreasonably censured as ignoble and out of place. But Addison was described, even by the bitterest Tory writers, as a gentleman of wit and virtue, in whose friendship many persons of both parties were happy, and whose name ought not to be mixed up with factious squabbles. Of the jests by which the triumph of the Whig party was disturbed, the most severe and happy was Bolingbroke's. Between two acts, he sent for Booth to his box, and presented him, before the whole theatre, with a purse of fifty guineas for defending the cause of liberty so well against the perpetual Dictator. This was a pungent allusion to the attempt which Marlborough had made, not long before his fall, to obtain a patent, creating him Captain-General for life. It was April; and in April, a hundred and thirty years ago, the London season was thought to be far advanced. During a whole month, however, Cato was performed to overflowing houses, and brought into the treasury of the theatre twice the gains of an ordinary spring. In the summer the Drury Lane Company went down to the Act at Oxford, and there, before an audience which retained an affectionate remembrance of Addison's accomplishments and virtues, his tragedy was acted during several days. The gownsmen began to besiege the theatre in the forenoon, and by one in the afternoon all the seats were filled. About the merits of the piece which had so extraordinary an effect, the public, we suppose, has made up its mind. To compare it with the masterpieces of the Attic stage, with the great English dramas of the time of Elizabeth, or even with the productions of Schiller's manhood, would be absurd indeed. Yet it contains excellent dialogue and declamation, and among plays fashioned on the French model, must be allowed to rank high; not indeed with Athalie, or Saul; but, we think not below Cinna, and certainly above any other English tragedy of the same school, above many of the plays of Corneille, above many of the plays of Voltaire and Alfieri, and above some plays of Racine. Be this as it may, we have little doubt that Cato did as much as the Tatlers, Spectators, and Freeholders united, to raise Addison's fame among his contemporaries. The modesty and good nature of the successful dramatist had tamed even the malignity of faction. But literary envy, it should seem, is a fiercer passion than party spirit. It was by a zealous Whig that the fiercest attack on the Whig tragedy was made. John Dennis published Remarks on Cato, which were written with some acuteness and with much coarseness and asperity. Addison neither defended himself nor retaliated. On many points he had an excellent defence; and, nothing would have been easier than to retaliate; for Dennis had written bad odes, bad tragedies, bad comedies: he had, moreover, a larger share than most men of those infirmities and eccentricities which excite laughter; and Addison's power of turning either an absurd book or an absurd man into ridicule was unrivalled. Addison, however, serenely conscious of his superiority, looked with pity on his assailant, whose temper, naturally irritable and gloomy, had been soured by want, by controversy, and by literary failures. But among the young candidates for Addison's favour there was one distinguished by talents from the rest, and distinguished, we fear, not less by malignity and insincerity. Pope was only twenty-five. But his powers had expanded to their full maturity; and his best poem, the Rape of the Lock, had recently been published. Of his genius, Addison had always expressed high admiration. But Addison had early discerned, what might indeed have been discerned by an eye less penetrating than his, that the diminutive, crooked, sickly boy was eager to revenge himself on society for the unkindness of nature. In the Spectator, the Essay on Criticism had been praised with cordial warmth; but a gentle hint had been added, that the writer of so excellent a poem would have done well to avoid ill-natured personalities. Pope, though evidently more galled by the censure than gratified by the praise, returned thanks for the admonition, and promised to profit by it. The two writers continued to exchange civilities, counsel, and small good offices. Addison publicly extolled Pope's miscellaneous pieces; and Pope furnished Addison with a prologue. This did not last long. Pope hated Dennis, whom he had injured without provocation. The appearance of the Remarks on Cato gave the irritable poet an opportunity of venting his malice under the show of friendship; and such an opportunity could not but be welcome to a nature which was implacable in enmity, and which always preferred the tortuous to the straight path. He published, accordingly, the Narrative of the Frenzy of John Dennis. But Pope had mistaken his powers. He was a great master of invective and sarcasm: he could dissect a character in terse and sonorous couplets, brilliant with antithesis: but of dramatic talent he was altogether destitute. If he had written a lampoon on Dennis, such as that on Atticus, or that on Sporus, the old grumbler would have been crushed. But Pope writing dialogue resembled--to borrow Horace's imagery and his own--a wolf, which, instead of biting, should take to kicking, or a monkey which should try to sting. The Narrative is utterly contemptible. Of argument there is not even the show; and the jests are such as, if they were introduced into a farce, would call forth the hisses of the shilling gallery. Dennis raves about the drama; and the nurse thinks that he is calling for a dram. "There is," he cries, "no peripetia in the tragedy, no change of fortune, no change at all." "Pray, good sir, be not angry," says the old woman; "I'll fetch change." This is not exactly the pleasantry of Addison. There can be no doubt that Addison saw through this officious zeal, and felt himself deeply aggrieved by it. So foolish and spiteful a pamphlet could do him no good, and, if he were thought to have any hand in it, must do him harm. Gifted with incomparable powers of ridicule, he had never even in self-defence, used those powers inhumanly or uncourteously; and he was not disposed to let others make his fame and his interests a pretext under which they might commit outrages from which he had himself constantly abstained. He accordingly declared that he had no concern in the Narrative, that he disapproved of it, and that if he answered the Remarks, he could answer them like a gentleman; and he took care to communicate this to Dennis. Pope was bitterly mortified; and to this transaction we are inclined to ascribe the hatred with which he ever after regarded Addison. In September 1713 the Guardian ceased to appear. Steele had gone mad about politics. A general election had just taken place: he had been chosen member for Stockbridge; and he fully expected to play a first part in Parliament. The immense success of the Tatler and Spectator had turned his head. He had been the editor of both those papers and was not aware how entirely they owed their influence and popularity to the genius of his friend. His spirits, always violent, were now excited by vanity, ambition, and faction, to such a pitch that he every day committed some offence against good sense and good taste. All the discreet and moderate members of his own party regretted and condemned his folly. "I am in a thousand troubles," Addison wrote, "about poor Dick, and wish that his zeal for the public may not be ruinous to himself. But he has sent me word that he is determined to go on, and that any advice I may give him in this particular will have no weight with him." Steele set up a political paper called the Englishman, which, as it was not supported by contributions from Addison, completely failed. By this work, by some other writings of the same kind, and by the airs which he gave himself at the first meeting of the new Parliament, he made the Tories so angry that they determined to expel him. The Whigs stood by him gallantly, but were unable to save him. The vote of expulsion was regarded by all dispassionate men as a tyrannical exercise of the power of the majority. But Steele's violence and folly, though they by no means justified the steps which his enemies took, had completely disgusted his friends; nor did he ever regain the place which he had held in the public estimation. Addison about this time conceived the design of adding an eighth volume to the Spectator  In June 1714 the first number of the new series appeared, and during about six months three papers were published weekly. Nothing can be more striking than the contrast between the Englishman and the eighth volume of the Spectator, between Steele without Addison and Addison without Steele. The Englishman is forgotten; the eighth volume of the Spectator contains, the finest essays, both serious and playful, in the language. Before this volume was completed, the death of Anne produced an entire change in the administration of public affairs. The blow fell suddenly. It found the Tory party distracted by internal feuds, and unprepared for any great effort. Harley had just been disgraced. Bolingbroke, it was supposed, would be the chief Minister. But the Queen was on her deathbed before the white staff had been given, and her last public act was to deliver it with a feeble hand to the Duke of Shrewsbury. The emergency produced a coalition between all sections of public men who were attached to the Protestant succession. George the First was proclaimed without opposition. A Council, in which the leading Whigs had seats, took the direction of affairs till the new King should arrive. The first act of the Lords justices was to appoint Addison their secretary. There is an idle tradition that he was directed to prepare a letter to the King, that he could not satisfy himself as to the style of this composition, and that the Lords Justices called in a clerk, who at once did what was wanted. It is not strange that a story so flattering to mediocrity should be popular; and we are sorry to deprive dunces of their consolation. But the truth must be told. It was well observed by Sir James Mackintosh, whose knowledge of these times was unequalled, that Addison never, in any official document, affected wit or eloquence, and that his despatches are, without exception, remarkable for unpretending simplicity. Everybody who knows with what ease Addison's finest essays were produced must be convinced that, if well-turned phrases had been wanted, he would have had no difficulty in finding them. We are, however, inclined to believe, that the story is not absolutely without a foundation. It may well be that Addison did not know, till he had consulted experienced clerks who remembered the times when William the Third was absent on the Continent, in what form a letter from the Council of Regency to the King ought to be drawn. We think it very likely that the ablest statesmen of our time, Lord John Russell, Sir Robert Peel, Lord Palmerston, for example, would, in similar circumstances, be found quite as ignorant. Every office has some little mysteries which the dullest man may learn with a little attention, and which the greatest man cannot possibly know by intuition. One paper must be signed by the chief of the department; another by his deputy: to a third the royal sign-manual is necessary. One communication is to be registered, and another is not. One sentence must be in black ink, and another in red ink. If the ablest Secretary for Ireland were moved to the India Board, if the ablest President of the India Board were moved to the War Office, he would require instruction on points like these; and we do not doubt that Addison required such instruction when he became, for the first time, Secretary to the Lords Justices. George the First took possession of his kingdom without opposition. A new Ministry was formed, and a new Parliament favourable to the Whigs chosen. Sunderland was appointed Lord- Lieutenant of Ireland; and Addison again went to Dublin as Chief Secretary. At Dublin Swift resided; and there was much speculation about the way in which the Dean and the Secretary would behave towards each other. The relations which existed between these remarkable men form an interesting and pleasing portion of literary history. They had early attached themselves to the same political party and to the same patrons. While Anne's Whig Ministry was in power, the visits of Swift to London and the official residence of Addison in Ireland had given them opportunities of knowing each other. They were the two shrewdest observers of their age. But their observations on each other had led them to favourable conclusions. Swift did full justice to the rare powers of conversation which were latent under the bashful deportment of Addison. Addison, on the other hand, discerned much good-nature under the severe look and manner of Swift; and, indeed, the Swift of 1708 and the Swift of 1738 were two very different men. But the paths of the two friends diverged widely. The Whig statesmen loaded Addison with solid benefits. They praised Swift, asked him to dinner, and did nothing more for him. His profession laid them under a difficulty. In the State they could not promote him; and they had reason to fear that, by bestowing preferment in the Church on the author of the Tale of a Tub, they might give scandal to the public, which had no high opinion of their orthodoxy. He did not make fair allowance for the difficulties which prevented Halifax and Somers from serving him, thought himself an ill-used man, sacrificed honour and consistency to revenge, joined the Tories, and became their most formidable champion. He soon found, however, that his old friends were less to blame than he had supposed. The dislike with which the Queen and the heads of the Church regarded him was insurmountable; and it was with the greatest difficulty that he obtained an ecclesiastical dignity of no great value, on condition of fixing his residence in a country which he detested. Difference of political opinion had produced, not indeed a quarrel, but a coolness between Swift and Addison. They at length ceased altogether to see each other. Yet there was between them a tacit compact like that between the hereditary guests in the Iliad: "'Egkhea d' allelon aleometha kai di' dmilon. Polloi men gar emoi Troes kleitoi t' epikouroi Kteinein on ke theos ge pori kai possi kikheio Polloi d' au soi Akhaioi enairmen, on ke duneai." It is not strange that Addison, who calumniated and insulted nobody, should not have calumniated or insulted Swift. But it is remarkable that Swift, to whom neither genius nor virtue was sacred, and who generally seemed to find, like most other renegades, a peculiar pleasure in attacking old friends, should have shown so much respect and tenderness to Addison. Fortune had now changed. The accession of the House of Hanover had secured in England the liberties of the people, and in Ireland the dominion of the Protestant caste. To that caste Swift was more odious than any other man. He was hooted and even pelted in the streets of Dublin; and could not venture to ride along the strand for his health without the attendance of armed servants. Many whom he had formerly served now libelled and insulted him. At this time Addison arrived. He had been advised not to show the smallest civility to the Dean of St. Patrick's. He had answered, with admirable spirit, that it might be necessary for men whose fidelity to their party was suspected, to hold no intercourse with political opponents; but that one who had been a steady Whig in the worst times might venture, when the good cause was triumphant, to shake hands with an old friend who was one of the vanquished Tories. His kindness was soothing to the proud and cruelly wounded spirit of Swift; and the two great satirists resumed their habits of friendly intercourse. Those associates of Addison whose political opinions agreed with his shared his good fortune. He took Tickell with him to Ireland. He procured for Budgell a lucrative place in the same kingdom. Ambrose Phillips was provided for in England, Steele had injured himself so much by his eccentricity and perverseness, that he obtained but a very small part of what he thought his due. He was, however, knighted; he had a place in the household; and he subsequently received other marks of favour from the Court. Addison did not remain long in Ireland. In 1715 he quitted his secretaryship for a seat at the Board of Trade. In the same year his comedy of the Drummer was brought on the stage. The name of the author was not announced; the piece was coldly received; and some critics had expressed a doubt whether it were really Addison's. To us the evidence, both external and internal, seems decisive. It is not in Addison's best manner; but it contains numerous passages which no other writer known to us could have produced. It was again performed after Addison's death, and, being known to be his, was loudly applauded. Towards the close of the year 1715, while the Rebellion was still raging in Scotland, Addison published the first number of a paper called the Freeholder. Among his political works the Freeholder is entitled to the first place. Even in the Spectator there are few serious papers nobler than the character of his friend Lord Somers, and certainly no satirical papers superior to those in which the Tory fox-hunter is introduced. This character is the original of Squire Western, and is drawn with all Fielding's force, and with a delicacy of which Fielding was altogether destitute. As none of Addison's works exhibit stronger marks of his genius than the Freeholder, so none does more honour to his moral character. It is difficult to extol too highly the candour and humanity of a political writer whom even the excitement of civil war cannot hurry into unseemly violence. Oxford, it is well known, was then the stronghold of Toryism. The High Street had been repeatedly lined with bayonets in order to keep down the disaffected gownsmen; and traitors pursued by the messengers of the Government had been concealed in the garrets of several colleges. Yet the admonition which, even under such circumstances, Addison addressed to the University, is singularly gentle, respectful, and even affectionate. Indeed, he could not find it in his heart to deal harshly even with imaginary persons. His fox-hunter, though ignorant, stupid, and violent, is at heart a good fellow, and is at last reclaimed by the clemency of the King. Steele was dissatisfied with his friend's moderation, and, though he acknowledged that the Freeholder was excellently written, complained that the Ministry played on a lute when it was necessary to blow the trumpet. He accordingly determined to execute a flourish after his own fashion, and tried to rouse the public spirit of the nation by means of a paper called the Town Talk, which is now as utterly forgotten as his Englishman, as his Crisis, as his Letter to the Bailiff of Stockbridge, as his Reader, in short, as everything that he wrote without the help of Addison. In the same year in which the Drummer was acted, and in which the first numbers of the Freeholder appeared, the estrangement of Pope and Addison became complete. Addison had from the first seen that Pope was false and malevolent. Pope had discovered that Addison was jealous. The discovery was made in a strange manner. Pope had written the Rape of the Lock, in two cantos, without supernatural machinery. These two cantos had been loudly applauded, and by none more loudly than by Addison. Then Pope thought of the Sylphs and Gnomes, Ariel, Momentilla, Crispissa, and Umbriel, and resolved to interweave the Rosicrucian mythology with the original fabric. He asked Addison's advice. Addison said that the poem as it stood was a delicious little thing, and entreated Pope not to run the risk of marring what was so excellent in trying to mend it. Pope afterwards declared that this insidious counsel first opened his eyes to the baseness of him who gave it. Now there can be no doubt that Pope's plan was most ingenious, and that he afterwards executed it with great skill and success. But does it necessarily follow that Addison's advice was bad. And if Addison's advice was bad, does it necessarily follow that it was given from bad motives? If a friend were to ask us whether we would advise him to risk his all in a lottery of which the chances were ten to one against him, we should do our best to dissuade him from running such a risk. Even if he were so lucky as to get the thirty thousand pound prize, we should not admit that we had counselled him ill; and we should certainly think it the height of injustice in him to accuse us of having been actuated by malice. We think Addison's advice good advice. It rested on a sound principle, the result of long and wide experience. The general rule undoubtedly is that, when a successful work of imagination has been produced, it should not be recast. We cannot at this moment call to mind a single instance in which this rule has been transgressed with happy effect, except the instance of the Rape of the Lock. Tasso recast his Jerusalem. Akenside recast his Pleasures of the Imagination, and his Epistle to Curio. Pope himself, emboldened no doubt by the success with which he had expanded and remodelled the Rape of the Lock, made the same experiment on the Dunciad. All these attempts failed. Who was to foresee that Pope would, once in his life, be able to do what he could not himself do twice, and what nobody else has ever done? Addison's advice was good. But had it been bad, why should we pronounce it dishonest? Scott tells us that one of his best friends predicted the failure of Waverley. Herder adjured Goethe not to take so unpromising a subject as Faust. Hume tried to dissuade Robertson from writing the History of Charles the Fifth Nay, Pope himself was one of those who prophesied that Cato would never succeed on the stage, and advised Addison to print it without risking a representation. But Scott, Goethe, Robertson, Addison, had the good sense and generosity to give their advisers credit for the best intentions. Pope's heart was not of the same kind with theirs. In 1715, while he was engaged in translating the Iliad, he met Addison at a coffee-house. Phillips and Budgell were there; but their sovereign got rid of them, and asked Pope to dine with him alone. After dinner Addison said that he lay under a difficulty which he wished to explain. "Tickell," he said, "translated some time ago the first book of the Iliad. I have promised to look it over and correct it. I cannot therefore ask to see yours; for that would be double-dealing." Pope made a civil reply, and begged that his second book might have the advantage of Addison's revision. Addison readily agreed, looked over the second book, and sent it back with warm commendations. Tickell's version of the first book appeared soon after this conversation. In the preface all rivalry was earnestly disclaimed. Tickell declared that he should not go on with the Iliad. That enterprise he should leave to powers which he admitted to be superior to his own. His only view, he said, in publishing this specimen was to bespeak the favour of the public to a translation of the Odyssey, in which he had made some progress. Addison, and Addison's devoted followers, pronounced both the versions good, but maintained that Tickell's had more of the original. The town gave a decided preference to Pope's. We do not think it worth while to settle such a question of precedence. Neither of the rivals can be said to have translated the Iliad, unless, indeed, the word translation be used in the sense which it bears in the Midsummer Night's Dream. When Bottom makes his appearance with an ass's head instead of his own, Peter Quince exclaims, "Bless thee! Bottom, bless thee! thou art translated." In this sense, undoubtedly, the readers of either Pope or Tickell may very properly exclaim, "Bless thee! Homer; thou art translated indeed." Our readers will, we hope, agree with us in thinking that no man in Addison's situation could have acted more fairly and kindly, both towards Pope and towards Tickell, than he appears to have done. But an odious suspicion had sprung up in the mind of Pope. He fancied, and he soon firmly believed, that there was a deep conspiracy against his fame and his fortunes. The work on which he had staked his reputation was to be depreciated. The subscription, on which rested his hopes of a competence, was to be defeated. With this view Addison had made a rival translation: Tickell had consented to father it; and the wits of Button's had united to puff it. Is there any external evidence to support this grave accusation? The answer is short. There is absolutely none. Was there any internal evidence which proved Addison to be the author of this version? Was it a work which Tickell was incapable of producing? Surely not. Tickell was a Fellow of a College at Oxford, and must be supposed to have been able to construe the Iliad; and he was a better versifier than his friend. We are not aware that Pope pretended to have discovered any turns of expression peculiar to Addison. Had such turns of expression been discovered, they would be sufficiently accounted for by supposing Addison to have corrected his friend's lines, as he owned that he had done. Is there anything in the character of the accused persons which makes the accusation probable? We answer confidently--nothing. Tickell was long after this time described by Pope himself as a very fair and worthy man. Addison had been, during many years, before the public. Literary rivals, political opponents, had kept their eyes on him. But neither envy nor faction, in their utmost rage, had ever imputed to him a single deviation from the laws of honour and of social morality. Had he been indeed a man meanly jealous of fame, and capable of stooping to base and wicked arts for the purpose of injuring his competitors, would his vices have remained latent so long? He was a writer of tragedy: had he ever injured Rowe? He was a writer of comedy: had he not done ample justice to Congreve, and given valuable help to Steele? He was a pamphleteer: have not his good nature and generosity been acknowledged by Swift, his rival in fame and his adversary in politics? That Tickell should have been guilty of a villany seems to us highly improbable. That Addison should have been guilty of a villany seems to us highly improbable. But that these two men should have conspired together to commit a villany seems to us improbable in a tenfold degree. All that is known to us of their intercourse tends to prove, that it was not the intercourse of two accomplices in crime. These are some of the lines in which Tickell poured forth his sorrow over the coffin of Addison: Or dost thou warn poor mortals left behind, A task well suited to thy gentle mind? Oh, if sometimes thy spotless form descend, To me thine aid, thou guardian genius, lend, When rage misguides me, or when fear alarms, When pain distresses, or when pleasure charms, In silent whisperings purer thoughts impart, And turn from ill a frail and feeble heart; Lead through the paths thy virtue trod before, Till bliss shall join, nor death can part us more." In what words, we should like to know, did this guardian genius invite his pupil to join in a plan such as the Editor of the Satirist would hardly dare to propose to the Editor of the Age? We do not accuse Pope of bringing an accusation which he knew to be false. We have not the smallest doubt that he believed it to be true; and the evidence on which he believed it he found in his own bad heart. His own life was one long series of tricks, as mean and as malicious as that of which he suspected Addison and Tickell. He was all stiletto and mask. To injure, to insult, and to save himself from the consequences of injury and insult by lying and equivocating, was the habit of his life. He published a lampoon on the Duke of Chandos; he was taxed with it; and he lied and equivocated. He published a lampoon on Aaron Hill; he was taxed with it; and he lied and equivocated. He published a still fouler lampoon on Lady Mary Wortley Montague; he was taxed with it; and he lied with more than usual effrontery and vehemence. He puffed himself and abused his enemies under feigned names. He robbed himself of his own letters, and then raised the hue and cry after them. Besides his frauds of malignity, of fear, of interest, and of vanity, there were frauds which he seems to have committed from love of fraud alone. He had a habit of stratagem, a pleasure in outwitting all who came near him. Whatever his object might be, the indirect road to it was that which he preferred. For Bolingbroke, Pope undoubtedly felt as much love and veneration as it was in his nature to feel for any human being. Yet Pope was scarcely dead when it was discovered that, from no motive except the mere love of artifice, he had been guilty of an act of gross perfidy to Bolingbroke. Nothing was more natural than that such a man as this should attribute to others that which he felt within himself. A plain, probable, coherent explanation is frankly given to him. He is certain that it is all a romance. A line of conduct scrupulously fair, and even friendly, is pursued towards him. He is convinced that it is merely a cover for a vile intrigue by which he is to be disgraced and ruined. It is vain to ask him for proofs. He has none, and wants none, except those which he carries in his own bosom. Whether Pope's malignity at length provoked Addison to retaliate for the first and last time, cannot now be known with certainty. We have only Pope's story, which runs thus. A pamphlet appeared containing some reflections which stung Pope to the quick. What those reflections were, and whether they were reflections of which he had a right to complain, we have now no means of deciding. The Earl of Warwick, a foolish and vicious lad, who regarded Addison with the feelings with which such lads generally regard their best friends, told Pope, truly or falsely, that this pamphlet had been written by Addison's direction. When we consider what a tendency stories have to grow, in passing even from one honest man to another honest man, and when we consider that to the name of honest man neither Pope nor the Earl of Warwick had a claim, we are not disposed to attach much importance to this anecdote. It is certain, however, that Pope was furious. He had already sketched the character of Atticus in prose. In his anger he turned this prose into the brilliant and energetic lines which everybody knows by heart, or ought to know by heart, and sent them to Addison. One charge which Pope has enforced with great skill is probably not without foundation. Addison was, we are inclined to believe, too fond of presiding over a circle of humble friends. Of the other imputations which these famous lines are intended to convey, scarcely one has ever been proved to be just, and some are certainly false. That Addison was not in the habit of "damning with faint praise" appears from innumerable passages in his writings, and from none more than from those in which he mentions Pope, And it is not merely unjust, but ridiculous, to describe a man who made the fortune of almost every one of his intimate friends, as "so obliging that he ne'er obliged." That Addison felt the sting of Pope's satire keenly, we cannot doubt. That he was conscious of one of the weaknesses with which he was reproached, is highly probable. But his heart, we firmly believe, acquitted him of the gravest part of the accusation. He acted like himself. As a satirist he was, at his own weapons, more than Pope's match; and he would have been at no loss for topics. A distorted and diseased body, tenanted by a yet more distorted and diseased mind; spite and envy thinly disguised by sentiments as benevolent and noble as those which Sir Peter Teazle admired in Mr. Joseph Surface; a feeble sickly licentiousness; an odious love of filthy and noisome images; these were things which a genius less powerful than that to which we owe the Spectator could easily have held up to the mirth and hatred of mankind. Addison, had, moreover, at his command, other means of vengeance which a bad man would not have scrupled to use. He was powerful in the State. Pope was a Catholic; and, in those times, a Minister would have found it easy to harass the most innocent Catholic by innumerable petty vexations. Pope, near twenty years later, said that "through the lenity of the Government alone he could live with comfort." "Consider," he exclaimed, " the injury that a man of high rank and credit may do to a private person, under penal laws and many other disadvantages." It is pleasing to reflect that the only revenge which Addison took was to insert in the Freeholder a warm encomium on the translation of the Iliad, and to exhort all lovers of learning to put down their names as subscribers. There could be no doubt, he said, from the specimens already published, that the masterly hand of Pope would do as much for Homer as Dryden had done for Virgil. From that time to the end of his life, he always treated Pope, by Pope's own acknowledgment, with justice. Friendship was, of course, at an end. One reason which induced the Earl of Warwick to play the ignominious part of talebearer on this occasion, may have been his dislike of the marriage which was about to take place between his mother and Addison. The Countess Dowager, a daughter of the old and honourable family of the Middletons of Chirk, a family which, in any country but ours, would be called noble, resided at Holland House. Addison had, during some years, occupied at Chelsea a small dwelling, once the abode of Nell Gwynn. Chelsea is now a district of London, and Holland House may be called a town residence. But, in the days of Anne and George the First, milkmaids and sportsmen wandered between green hedges and over fields bright with daisies, from Kensington almost to the shore of the Thames. Addison and Lady Warwick were country neighbours, and became intimate friends. The great wit and scholar tried to allure the young Lord from the fashionable amusements of beating watchmen, breaking windows, and rolling women in hogsheads down Holborn Hill, to the study of letters, and the practice of virtue. These well-meant exertions did little good, however, either to the disciple or to the master. Lord Warwick grew up a rake; and Addison fell in love. The mature beauty of the Countess has been celebrated by poets in language which, after a very large allowance has been made for flattery, would lead us to believe that she was a fine woman; and her rank doubtless heightened her attractions. The courtship was long. The hopes of the lover appear to have risen and fallen with the fortunes of his party. His attachment was at length a matter of such notoriety that, when he visited Ireland for the last time, Rowe addressed some consolatory verses to the Chloe of Holland House. It strikes us as a little strange that, in these verses, Addison should be called Lycidas, a name of singularly evil omen for a swain just about to cross St. George's Channel. At length Chloe capitulated. Addison was indeed able to treat with her on equal terms. He had reason to expect preferment even higher than that which he had attained. He had inherited the fortune of a brother who died Governor of Madras. He had purchased an estate in Warwickshire, and had been welcomed to his domain in very tolerable verse by one of the neighbouring squires, the poetical fox-hunter, William Somerville. In August 1716, the newspapers announced that Joseph Addison, Esquire, famous for many excellent works both in verse and prose, had espoused the Countess Dowager of Warwick. He now fixed his abode at Holland House, a house which can boast of a greater number of inmates distinguished in political and literary history than any other private dwelling in England. His portrait still hangs there. The features are pleasing; the complexion is remarkably fair; but, in the expression, we trace rather the gentleness of his disposition than the force and keenness of his intellect. Not long after his marriage he reached the height of civil greatness. The Whig Government had, during some time, been torn by internal dissensions. Lord Townshend led one section of the Cabinet, Lord Sunderland the other. At length, in the spring of 1717, Sunderland triumphed. Townshend retired from office, and was accompanied by Walpole and Cowper. Sunderland proceeded to reconstruct the Ministry; and Addison was appointed Secretary of State. It is certain that the Seals were pressed upon him, and were at first declined by him. Men equally versed in official business might easily have been found; and his colleagues knew that they could not expect assistance from him in debate. He owed his elevation to his popularity, to his stainless probity, and to his literary fame. But scarcely had Addison entered the Cabinet when his health began to fail. From one serious attack he recovered in the autumn; and his recovery was celebrated in Latin verses, worthy of his own pen, by Vincent Bourne, who was then at Trinity College, Cambridge. A relapse soon took place; and, in the following spring, Addison was prevented by a severe asthma from discharging the duties of his post. He resigned it, and was succeeded by his friend Craggs, a young man whose natural parts, though little improved by cultivation, were quick and showy, whose graceful person and winning manners had made him generally acceptable in society, and who, if he had lived, would probably have been the most formidable of all the rivals of Walpole. As yet there was no Joseph Hume. The Ministers, therefore, were able to bestow on Addison a retiring pension of fifteen hundred pounds a year. In what form this pension was given we are not told by the biographers, and have not time to inquire, But it is certain that Addison did not vacate his seat in the House of Commons. Rest of mind and body seem to have re-established his health; and he thanked God, with cheerful piety, for having set him free both from his office and from his asthma. Many years seemed to be before him, and he meditated many works, a tragedy on the death of Socrates, a translation of the Psalms, a treatise on the evidences of Christianity. Of this last performance, a part, which we could well spare, has come down to us. But the fatal complaint soon returned, and gradually prevailed against all the resources of medicine. It is melancholy to think that the last months of such a life should have been overclouded both by domestic and by political vexations. A tradition which began early, which has been generally received, and to which we have nothing to oppose, has represented his wife as an arrogant and imperious woman. It is said that, till his health failed him, he was glad to escape from the Countess Dowager and her magnificent dining-room, blazing with the gilded devices of the House of Rich, to some tavern where he could enjoy a laugh, a talk about Virgil and Boileau, and a bottle of claret, with the friends of his happier days. All those friends, however, were not left to him. Sir Richard Steele had been gradually estranged by various causes. He considered himself as one who, in evil times, had braved martyrdom for his political principles, and demanded, when the Whig party was triumphant, a large compensation for what he had suffered when it was militant. The Whig leaders took a very different view of his claims. They thought that he had, by his own petulance and folly, brought them as well as himself into trouble, and though they did not absolutely neglect him, doled out favours to him with a sparing hand. It was natural that he should be angry with them, and especially angry with Addison. But what above all seems to have disturbed Sir Richard, was the elevation of Tickell, who, at thirty, was made by Addison Under- Secretary of State; while the editor of the Tatler and Spectator, and the author of the Crisis, and member for Stockbridge who had been persecuted for firm adherence to the House of Hanover, was, at near fifty, forced, after many solicitations and complaints, to content himself with a share in the patent of Drury Lane Theatre. Steele himself says, in his celebrated letter to Congreve, that Addison, by his preference of Tickell, "incurred the warmest resentment of other gentlemen"; and everything seems to indicate that, of those resentful gentlemen, Steele was himself one. While poor Sir Richard was brooding over what he considered as Addison's unkindness, a new cause of quarrel arose. The Whig party, already divided against itself, was rent by a new schism. The celebrated Bill for limiting the number of Peers had been brought in. The proud Duke of Somerset, first in rank of all the nobles whose religion permitted them to sit in Parliament, was the ostensible author of the measure. But it was supported, and in truth devised, by the Prime Minister. We are satisfied that the bill was most pernicious; and we fear that the motives which induced Sunderland to frame it were not honourable to him. But we cannot deny that it was supported by many of the best and wisest men of that age. Nor was this strange. The royal prerogative had, within the memory of the generation then in the vigour of life, been so grossly abused, that it was still regarded with a jealousy which, when the peculiar situation of the House of Brunswick is considered, may perhaps be called immoderate. The particular prerogative of creating peers had, in the opinion of the Whigs, been grossly abused by Queen Anne's last Ministry; and even the Tories admitted that her Majesty, in swamping, as it has since been called, the Upper House, had done what only an extreme case could justify. The theory of the English constitution, according to many high authorities, was that three independent powers, the sovereign, the nobility, and the commons, ought constantly to act as checks on each other. If this theory were sound, it seemed to follow that to put one of these powers under the absolute control of the other two, was absurd. But if the number of peers were unlimited, it could not well be denied that the Upper House was under the absolute control of the Crown and the Commons, and was indebted only to their moderation for any power which it might be suffered to retain. Steele took part with the Opposition, Addison with the Ministers. Steele, in a paper called the Plebeian, vehemently attacked the bill. Sunderland called for help on Addison, and Addison obeyed the call. In a paper called the Old Whig, he answered, and indeed refuted, Steele's arguments. It seems to us that the premises of both the controversialists were unsound, that on those premises Addison reasoned well and Steele ill, and that consequently Addison brought out a false conclusion while Steele blundered upon the truth. In style, in wit, and in politeness, Addison maintained his superiority; though the Old Whig is by no means one of his happiest performances. At first, both the anonymous opponents observed the laws of propriety. But at length Steele so far forgot himself as to throw an odious imputation on the morals of the chiefs of the administration. Addison replied with severity, but, in our opinion, with less severity than was due to so grave an offence against morality and decorum; nor did he, in his just anger, forget for a moment the laws of good taste and good breeding. One calumny which has been often repeated, and never yet contradicted, it is our duty to expose. It is asserted in the Biogaphia Britannica, that Addison designated Steele as "little Dicky." This assertion was repeated by Johnson who had never seen the Old Whig; and was therefore excusable. It has also been repeated by Miss Aikin, who has seen the Old Whig, and for whom therefore there is less excuse. Now, it is true that the words "little Dicky" occur in the Old Whig, and that Steele's name was Richard. It is equally true that the words "little Isaac " occur in the Duenna, and that Newton's name was Isaac. But we confidently affirm that Addison's "little Dicky" had no more to do with Steele, than Sheridan's "little Isaac" with Newton. If we apply the words "little Dicky" to Steele, we deprive a very lively and ingenious passage, not only of all its wit, but of all its meaning. Little Dicky was the nickname of Henry Norris, an actor of remarkably small stature, but of great humour, who played the usurer Gomez, then a most popular part, in Dryden's Spanish Friar.  [We will transcribe the whole paragraph. How it can ever have been misunderstood is unintelligible to us. "But our author's chief concern is for the poor House of Commons, whom he represents as naked and defenceless, when the Crown, by losing this prerogative, would be less able to protect them against the power of a House of Lords. Who forbears laughing when the Spanish Friar represents little Dicky under the person of Gomez, insulting the Colonel that was able to fright him out of his wits with a single frown? This Gomez, says he, flew upon him like a dragon, got him down, the Devil being strong in him, and gave him bastinado on bastinado, and buffet on buffet, which the poor Colonel, being prostrate, suffered with a most Christian patience. The improbability of the fact never fails to raise mirth in the audience; and one may venture to answer for a British House of Commons, if we may guess, from its conduct hitherto, that it will scarce be either so tame or so weak as our author supposes."] The merited reproof which Steele had received, though softened by some kind and courteous expressions, galled him bitterly. He replied with little force and great acrimony; but no rejoinder appeared. Addison was fast hastening to his grave; and had, we may well suppose, little disposition to prosecute a quarrel with an old friend. His complaint had terminated in dropsy. He bore up long and manfully. But at length he abandoned all hope, dismissed his physicians, and calmly prepared himself to die. His works he intrusted to the care of Tickell, and dedicated them a very few days before his death to Craggs, in a letter written with the sweet and graceful eloquence of a Saturday's Spectator. In this, his last composition, he alluded to his approaching end in words so manly, so cheerful, and so tender, that it is difficult to read them without tears. At the same time he earnestly recommended the interests of Tickell to the care of Craggs. Within a few hours of the time at which this dedication was written, Addison sent to beg Gay, who was then living by his wits about town, to come to Holland House. Gay went, and was received with great kindness. To his amazement his forgiveness was implored by the dying man. Poor Gay, the most good-natured and simple of mankind, could not imagine what he had to forgive. There was, however, some wrong, the remembrance of which weighed on Addison's mind, and which he declared himself anxious to repair. He was in a state of extreme exhaustion; and the parting was doubtless a friendly one on both sides. Gay supposed that some plan to serve him had been in agitation at Court, and had been frustrated by Addison's influence. Nor is this improbable. Gay had paid assiduous court to the royal family. But in the Queen's days he had been the eulogist of Bolingbroke, and was still connected with many Tories. It is not strange that Addison, while heated by conflict, should have thought himself justified in obstructing the preferment of one whom he might regard as a political enemy. Neither is it strange that, when reviewing his whole life, and earnestly scrutinising all his motives, he should think that he had acted an unkind and ungenerous part, in using his power against a distressed man of letters, who was as harmless and as helpless as a child. One inference may be drawn from this anecdote. It appears that Addison, on his death-bed, called himself to a strict account, and was not at ease till he had asked pardon for an injury which it was not even suspected that he had committed, for an injury which would have caused disquiet only to a very tender conscience. Is it not then reasonable to infer that, if he had really been guilty of forming a base conspiracy against the fame and fortunes of a rival, he would have expressed some remorse for so serious a crime? But it is unnecessary to multiply arguments and evidence for the defence, when there is neither argument nor evidence for the accusation. The last moments of Addison were perfectly serene. His interview with his step-son is universally known. "See," he said, "how a Christian can die." The piety of Addison was, in truth, of a singularly cheerful character. The feeling which predominates in all his devotional writings, is gratitude. God was to him the all-wise and all-powerful friend who had watched over his cradle with more than maternal tenderness; who had listened to his cries before they could form themselves in prayer; who had preserved his youth from the snares of vice; who had made his cup run over with worldly blessings; who had doubled the value of those blessings, by bestowing a thankful heart to enjoy them, and dear friends to partake them; who had rebuked the waves of the Ligurian gulf, had purified the autumnal air of the Campagna, and had restrained the avalanches of Mont Cenis. Of the Psalms, his favourite was that which represents the Ruler of all things under the endearing image of a shepherd, whose crook guides the flock safe, through gloomy and desolate glens, to meadows well watered and rich with herbage. On that goodness to which he ascribed all the happiness of his life, he relied in the hour of death with the love which casteth out fear. He died on the seventeenth of June 1710. He had just entered on his forty-eighth year. His body lay in state in the Jerusalem Chamber, and was borne thence to the Abbey at dead of night. The choir sang a funeral hymn. Bishop Atterbury, one of those Tories who had loved and honoured the most accomplished of the Whigs, met the corpse, and led the procession by torchlight, round the shrine of Saint Edward and the graves of the Plantagenets, to the Chapel of Henry the Seventh. On the north side of that Chapel, in the vault of the House of Albemarle, the coffin of Addison lies next to the coffin of Montague. Yet a few months; and the same mourners passed again along the same aisle. The same sad anthem was again chanted. The same vault was again opened; and the coffin of Craggs was placed close to the coffin of Addison. Many tributes were paid to the memory of Addison; but one alone is now remembered. Tickell bewailed his friend in an elegy which would do honour to the greatest name in our literature, and which unites the energy and magnificence of Dryden to the tenderness and purity of Cowper. This fine poem was prefixed to a superb edition of Addison's works, which was published, in 1721, by subscription. The names of the subscribers proved how widely his fame had been spread. That his countrymen should be eager to possess his writings, even in a costly form, is not wonderful. But it is wonderful that, though English literature was then little studied on the Continent, Spanish Grandees, Italian Prelates, Marshals of France, should be found in the list. Among the most remarkable names are those of the Queen of Sweden, of Prince Eugene, of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, of the Dukes of Parma, Modena, and Guastalla, of the Doge of Genoa, of the Regent Orleans, and of Cardinal Dubois. We ought to add that this edition, though eminently beautiful, is in some important points defective; nor, indeed, do we yet possess a complete collection of Addison's writings. It is strange that neither his opulent and noble widow, nor any of his powerful and attached friends, should have thought of placing even a simple tablet, inscribed with his name, on the walls of the Abbey. It was not till three generations had laughed and wept over his pages that the omission was supplied by the public veneration. At length, in our own time, his image, skilfully graven, appeared in Poet's Corner. It represents him, as we can conceive him, clad in his dressing-gown, and freed from his wig, stepping from his parlour at Chelsea into his trim little garden, with the account of the "Everlasting Club," or the "Loves of Hilpa and Shalum," just finished for the next day's Spectator, in his hand. Such a mark of national respect was due to the unsullied statesman, to the accomplished scholar, to the master of pure English eloquence, to the consummate painter of life and manners. It was due, above all, to the great satirist, who alone knew how to use ridicule without abusing it, who, without inflicting a wound, effected a great social reform, and who reconciled wit and virtue, after a long and disastrous separation, during which wit had been led astray by profligacy, and virtue by fanaticism. SAMUEL JOHNSON (September 1831) The Life of Samuel Johnson LL. D. Including a Journal Of a Tour to the Hebrides by James Boswell, Esq. A new Edition, with numerous Additions and Notes By JOHN WILSON CROKER, LL.D., F.R.S. Five volumes, 8vo. London: 1831 THIS work has greatly disappointed us. Whatever faults we may have been prepared to find in it, we fully expected that it would be a valuable addition to English literature; that it would contain many curious facts, and many judicious remarks; that the style of the notes would be neat, clear, and precise; and that the typographical execution would be, as in new editions of classical works it ought to be, almost faultless. We are sorry to be obliged to say that the merits of Mr. Croker's performance are on a par with those of a certain leg of mutton on which Dr. Johnson dined, while travelling from London to Oxford, and which he, with characteristic energy, pronounced to be "as bad as bad could be, ill fed, ill killed, ill kept, and ill dressed." This edition is ill compiled, ill arranged, ill written, and ill printed. Nothing in the work has astonished us so much as the ignorance or carelessness of Mr. Croker with respect to facts and dates. Many of his blunders are such as we should be surprised to hear any well-educated gentleman commit, even in conversation. The notes absolutely swarm with misstatements, into which the editor never would have fallen, if he had taken the slightest pains to investigate the truth of his assertions, or if he had even been well acquainted with the book on which he undertook to comment. We will give a few instances. Mr. Croker tells us in a note that Derrick, who was master of the ceremonies at Bath, died very poor in 1760. [Vol. i. 394.] We read on; and, a few pages later, we find Dr. Johnson and Boswell talking of this same Derrick as still living and reigning, as having retrieved his character, as possessing so much power over his subjects at Bath, that his opposition might be fatal to Sheridan's lectures on oratory. [i. 404.] And all this is in 1763. The fact is, that Derrick died in 1769. In one note we read, that Sir Herbert Croft, the author of that pompous and foolish account of Young, which appears among the Lives of the Poets, died in 1805. [Vol. iv. 321.] Another note in the same volume states, that this same Sir Herbert Croft died at Paris, after residing abroad for fifteen years, on the 27th of April, 1816. [iv. 428.] Mr. Croker informs us, that Sir William Forbes of Pitsligo, the author of the Life of Beattie, died in 1816. [ii. 262.] A Sir William Forbes undoubtedly died in that year, but not the Sir William Forbes in question, whose death took place in 1806. It is notorious, indeed, that the biographer of Beattie lived just long enough to complete the history of his friend. Eight or nine years before the date which Mr. Croker has assigned for Sir William's death, Sir Walter Scott lamented that event in the introduction to the fourth canto of Marmion. Every schoolgirl knows the lines: "Scarce had lamented Forbes paid The tribute to his Minstrel's shade; The tale of friendship scarce was told, Ere the narrator's heart was cold: Far may we search before we find A heart so manly and so kind!" In one place, we are told, that Allan Ramsay, the painter, was born in 1709, and died in 1784; [iv. 105.] in another, that he died in 1784, in the seventy-first year of his age. [v. 281.] In one place, Mr. Croker says, that at the commencement of the intimacy between Dr. Johnson and Mrs. Thrale, in 1765, the lady was twenty-five years old. [i. 510.] In other places he says, that Mrs. Thrale's thirty-fifth year coincided with Johnson's seventieth. [iv. 271, 322.] Johnson was born in 1709. If, therefore, Mrs. Thrale's thirty-fifth year coincided with Johnson's seventieth, she could have been only twenty-one years old in 1765. This is not all. Mr. Croker, in another place, assigns the year 1777 as the date of the complimentary lines which Johnson made on Mrs. Thrale's thirty-fifth birthday. [iii. 463.] If this date be correct, Mrs. Thrale must have been born in 1742, and could have been only twenty-three when her acquaintance with Johnson commenced. Mr. Croker therefore gives us three different statements as to her age. Two of the three must be incorrect. We will not decide between them; we will only say, that the reasons which Mr. Croker gives for thinking that Mrs. Thrale was exactly thirty-five years old when Johnson was seventy, appear to us utterly frivolous. Again, Mr. Croker informs his readers that "Lord Mansfield survived Johnson full ten years." [ii. 151.] Lord Mansfield survived Dr. Johnson just eight years and a quarter. Johnson found in the library of a French lady, whom he visited during his short visit to Paris, some works which he regarded with great disdain.  "I looked," says he, "into the books in the lady's closet, and, in contempt, showed them to Mr. Thrale. Prince Titi, Bibliotheque des Fees, and other books." [iii. 271.] The History of Prince Titi, observes Mr. Croker, "was said to be the autobiography of Frederick Prince of Wales, but was probably written by Ralph his secretary." A more absurd note never was penned. The History of Prince Titi, to which Mr. Croker refers, whether written by Prince Frederick or by Ralph, was certainly never published. If Mr. Croker had taken the trouble to read with attention that very passage in Park's Royal and Noble Authors which he cites as his authority, he would have seen that the manuscript was given up to the Government. Even if this memoir had been printed, it is not very likely to find its way into a French lady's bookcase. And would any man in his senses speak contemptuously of a French lady, for having in her possession an English work, so curious and interesting as a Life of Prince Frederick, whether written by himself or by a confidential secretary, must have been? The history at which Johnson laughed was a very proper companion to the Bibliotheque des Fees, a fairy tale about good Prince Titi and naughty Prince Violent. Mr. Croker may find it in the Magasin des Enfans, the first French book which the little girls of England read to their governesses. Mr. Croker states that Mr. Henry Bate, who afterwards assumed the name of Dudley, was proprietor of the Morning Herald, and fought a duel with George Robinson Stoney, in consequence of some attacks on Lady Strathmore which appeared in that paper. [v. 196.] Now Mr. Bate was then connected, not with the Morning Herald, but with the Morning Post; and the dispute took place before the Morning Herald was in existence. The duel was fought in January 1777. The Chronicle of the Annual Register for that year contains an account of the transaction, and distinctly states that Mr. Bate was editor of the Morning Post. The Morning Herald, as any person may see by looking at any number of it, was not established till some years after this affair. For this blunder there is, we must acknowledge some excuse; for it certainly seems almost incredible to a person living in our time that any human being should ever have stooped to fight with a writer in the Morning Post. "James de Duglas," says Mr. Croker, "was requested by King Robert Bruce, in his last hours, to repair, with his heart, to Jerusalem, and humbly to deposit it at the sepulchre of our Lord, which he did in 1329." [Vol. iv. 29.] Now, it is well known that he did no such thing, and for a very sufficient reason, because he was killed by the way. Nor was it in 1329 that he set out. Robert Bruce died in 1329, and the expedition of Douglas took place in the following year, "Quand le printemps vint et la saison," says Froissart, in June 1330, says Lord Hailes, whom Mr. Croker cites as the authority for his statement. Mr, Croker tells us that the great Marquis of Montrose was beheaded at Edinburgh in 1650. [ii. 526.] There is not a forward boy at any school in England who does not know that the marquis was hanged. The account of the execution is one of the finest passages in Lord Clarendon's History. We can scarcely suppose that Mr. Croker has never read that passage; and yet we can scarcely suppose that any person who has ever perused so noble and pathetic a story can have utterly forgotten all its most striking circumstances. "Lord Townshend," says Mr. Croker, "was not Secretary of State till 1720." [iii. 52.] Can Mr. Croker possibly be ignorant that Lord Townshend was made Secretary of State at the Accession of George I. in 1714, that he continued to be Secretary of State till he was displaced by the intrigues of Sunderland and Stanhope at the close of 1716, and that he returned to the office of Secretary of State, not in 1720 but in 1721? Mr. Croker, indeed, is generally unfortunate in his statements respecting the Townshend family. He tells us that Charles Townshend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, was "nephew of the Prime Minister, and son of a peer who was Secretary of State, and leader of the House of Lords." [iii. 368.]  Charles Townshend was not nephew, but grandnephew, of the Duke of Newcastle, not son, but grandson, of the Lord Townshend who was Secretary of State, and leader of the House of Lords. "General Burgoyne surrendered at Saratoga," says Mr. Croker, "in March 1778." [iv. 222.] General Bourgoyne surrendered on the 17th of October 1777. Nothing," says Mr. Croker, "can be more unfounded than the assertion that Byng fell a martyr to political party. By a strange coincidence of circumstances, it happened that there was a total change of administration between his condemnation and his death: so that one party presided at his trial, and another at his execution: there can be no stronger proof that he was not a political martyr." [i. 298.] Now what will our readers think of this writer, when we assure them that this statement, so confidently made, respecting events so notorious, is absolutely untrue? One and the same administration was in office when the court-martial on Byng commenced its sittings, through the whole trial, at the condemnation, and at the execution. In the month of November 1756, the Duke of Newcastle and Lord Hardwicke resigned; the Duke of Devonshire became First Lord of the Treasury, and Mr. Pitt, Secretary of State. This  administration lasted till the month of April 1757. Byng's court-martial began to sit on the 28th of December 1756. He was shot on the 14th of March 1757. There is something at once diverting and provoking in the cool and authoritative manner in which Mr. Croker makes these random assertions. We do not suspect him of intentionally falsifying history. But of this high literary misdemeanour we do without hesitation accuse him that he has no adequate sense of the obligation which a writer, who professes to relate facts, owes to the public. We accuse him of a negligence and an ignorance analogous to that crassa negligentia, and that crassa ignorantia, on which the law animadverts in magistrates and surgeons, even when malice and corruption are not imputed. We accuse him of having undertaken a work which, if not performed with strict accuracy, must be very much worse than useless, and of having performed it as if the difference between an accurate and an inaccurate statement was not worth the trouble of looking into the most common book of reference. But we must proceed. These volumes contain mistakes more gross, if possible, than any that we have yet mentioned. Boswell has recorded some observations made by Johnson on the changes which had taken place in Gibbon's religious opinions. That Gibbon when a lad at Oxford turned Catholic is well known. "It is said," cried Johnson, laughing, "that he has been a Mahommedan." "This sarcasm," says the editor, "probably alludes to the tenderness with which Gibbon's malevolence to Christianity induced him to treat Mahommedanism in his history." Now the sarcasm was uttered in 1776; and that part of the History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire which relates to Mahommedanism was not published till 1788, twelve years after the date of this conversation, and near four years after the death of Johnson. [A defence of this blunder was attempted. That the celebrated chapters in which Gibbon has traced the progress of Mahommedanism were not written in 1776 could not be denied. But it was confidently asserted that his partiality to Mahommedanism appeared in his first volume. This assertion is untrue. No passage which can by any art be construed into the faintest indication of the faintest partiality for Mahommedanism has ever been quoted or ever will be quoted from the first volume of the History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. To what, then, it has been asked, could Johnson allude? Possibly to some anecdote or some conversation of which all trace is lost. One conjecture may be offered, though with diffidence. Gibbon tells us in his Memoirs, that at Oxford he took a fancy for studying Arabic, and was prevented from doing so by the remonstrances of his tutor. Soon after this, the young man fell in with Bossuet's controversial writings, and was speedily converted by them to the Roman Catholic faith. The apostasy of a gentleman commoner would of course be for a time the chief subject of conversation in the common room of Magdalene. His whim about Arabic learning would naturally be mentioned, and would give occasion to some jokes about the probability of his turning Mussulman. If such jokes were made, Johnson, who frequently visited Oxford, was very likely to hear of them.] "It was in the year 1761," says Mr. Croker, "that Goldsmith published his Vicar of Wakefield. This leads the editor to observe a more serious inaccuracy of Mrs. Piozzi, than Mr. Boswell notices, when he says Johnson left her table to go and sell the Vicar of Wakefield for Goldsmith. Now Dr. Johnson was not acquainted with the Thrales till 1765, four years after the book had been published." [Vol. v. 409] Mr. Croker, in reprehending the fancied inaccuracy of Mrs. Thrale, has himself shown a degree of inaccuracy, or, to speak more properly, a degree of ignorance, hardly credible. In the first place, Johnson became acquainted with the Thrales, not in 1765, but in 1764, and during the last weeks of 1764 dined with them every Thursday, as is written in Mrs. Piozzi's anecdotes. In the second place, Goldsmith published the Vicar of Wakefield, not in 1761, but in 1766. Mrs. Thrale does not pretend to remember the precise date of the summons which called Johnson from her table to the help of his friend. She says only that it was near the beginning of her acquaintance with Johnson, and certainly not later than 1766. Her accuracy is therefore completely vindicated. It was probably after one of her Thursday dinners in 1764 that the celebrated scene of the landlady, the sheriff's officer, and the bottle of Madeira, took place. [This paragraph has been altered; and a slight inaccuracy immaterial to the argument, has been removed.] The very page which contains this monstrous blunder, contains another blunder, if possible, more monstrous still. Sir Joseph Mawbey, a foolish member of Parliament, at whose speeches and whose pig-styes the wits of Brookes's were, fifty years ago, in the habit of laughing most unmercifully, stated, on the authority of Garrick, that Johnson, while sitting in a coffee-house at Oxford, about the time of his doctor's degree, used some contemptuous expressions respecting Home's play and Macpherson's Ossian. "Many men," he said, "many women, and many children, might have written Douglas." Mr. Croker conceives that he has detected an inaccuracy, and glories over poor Sir Joseph in a most characteristic manner. I have quoted this anecdote solely with the view of showing to how little credit hearsay anecdotes are in general entitled. Here is a story published by Sir Joseph Mawbey, a member of the House of Commons, and a person every way worthy of credit, who says he had it from Garrick. Now mark: Johnson's visit to Oxford, about the time of his doctor's degree, was in 1754, the first time he had been there since he left the university. But Douglas was not acted till 1756, and Ossian not published till 1760. All, therefore, that is new in Sir Joseph Mawbey's story is false." [Vol. v. 409.] Assuredly we need not go far to find ample proof that a member of the House of Commons may commit a very gross error. Now mark, say we, in the language of Mr. Croker. The fact is, that Johnson took his Master's degree in 1754, [i. 262.] and his Doctor's degree in 1775. [iii. 205.] In the spring of 1776, [iii. 326.] he paid a visit to Oxford, and at this visit a conversation respecting the works on Home and Macpherson might have taken place, and, in all probability, did take place. The only real objection to the story Mr. Croker has missed. Boswell states, apparently on the best authority, that, as early at least as the year 1763, Johnson, in conversation with Blair, used the same expressions respecting Ossian, which Sir Joseph represents him as having used respecting Douglas. [i. 405.] Sir Joseph, or Garrick, confounded, we suspect, the two stories. But their error is venial, compared with that of Mr. Croker. We will not multiply instances of this scandalous inaccuracy. It is clear that a writer who, even when warned by the text on which he is commenting, falls into such mistakes as these, is entitled to no confidence whatever. Mr. Croker has committed an error of five years with respect to the publication of Goldsmith's novel, an error of twelve years with respect to the publication of part of Gibbon's History, an error of twenty-one years with respect to an event in Johnson's life so important as the taking of the doctoral degree. Two of these three errors he has committed, while ostentatiously displaying his own accuracy, and correcting what he represents as the loose assertions of others. How can his readers take on trust his statements concerning the births, marriages, divorces, and deaths of a crowd of people, whose names are scarcely known to this generation? It is not likely that a person who is ignorant of what almost everybody knows can know that of which almost everybody is ignorant. We did not open this book with any wish to find blemishes in it. We have made no curious researches. The work itself, and a very common knowledge of literary and political history, have enabled us to detect the mistakes which we have pointed out, and many other mistakes of the same kind. We must say, and we say it with regret, that we do not consider the authority of Mr. Croker, unsupported by other evidence, as sufficient to justify any writer who may follow him in relating a single anecdote or in assigning a date to a single event. Mr. Croker shows almost as much ignorance and heedlessness in his criticisms as in his statements concerning facts. Dr. Johnson said, very reasonably as it appears to us, that some of the satires of Juvenal are too gross for imitation. Mr. Croker, who, by the way, is angry with Johnson for defending Prior's tales against the charge of indecency, resents this aspersion on Juvenal, and indeed refuses to believe that the doctor can have said anything so absurd. "He probably said--some passages of them--for there are none of Juvenal's satires to which the same objection may be made as to one of Horace's, that it is altogether gross and licentious." [Vol. i. 167.] Surely Mr. Croker can never have read the second and ninth satires of Juvenal. Indeed the decisions of this editor on points of classical learning, though pronounced in a very authoritative tone, are generally such that, if a schoolboy under our care were to utter them, our soul assuredly should not spare for his crying. It is no disgrace to a gentleman who has been engaged during near thirty years in political life that he has forgotten his Greek and Latin. But he becomes justly ridiculous if, when no longer able to construe a plain sentence, he affects to sit in judgment on the most delicate questions of style and metre. From one blunder, a blunder which no good scholar would have made, Mr. Croker was saved, as he informs us, by Sir Robert Peel, who quoted a passage exactly in point from Horace. We heartily wish that Sir Robert, whose classical attainments are well known, had been more frequently consulted. Unhappily he was not always at his friend's elbow; and we have therefore a rich abundance of the strangest errors. Boswell has preserved a poor epigram by Johnson, inscribed "Ad Lauram parituram." Mr. Croker censures the poet for applying the word puella to a lady in Laura's situation, and for talking of the beauty of Lucina. "Lucina," he says, "was never famed for her beauty." [i. 133.] If Sir Robert Peel had seen this note, he probably would have again refuted Mr. Croker's criticisms by an appeal to Horace. In the secular ode, Lucina is used as one of the names of Diana, and the beauty of Diana is extolled by all the most orthodox doctors of the ancient mythology, from Homer in his Odyssey, to Claudian in his Rape of Proserpine. In another ode, Horace describes Diana as the goddess who assists the "laborantes utero puellas." But we are ashamed to detain our readers with this fourth-form learning. Boswell found, in his tour to the Hebrides, an inscription written by a Scotch minister. It runs thus: "Joannes Macleod, etc. gentis suae Philarchus, etc Florae Macdonald matrimoniali vinculo conjugatus turrem hanc Beganodunensem proaevorum habitaculum longe vetustissimum, diu penitus labefactatam anno aerae vulgaris MDCLXXXVI. instauravit."--"The minister," says Mr. Croker, "seems to have been no contemptible Latinist. Is not Philarchus a very happy term to express the paternal and kindly authority of the head of a clan?" [ii. 458.] The composition of this eminent Latinist, short as it is, contains several words that are just as much Coptic as Latin, to say nothing of the incorrect structure of the sentence. The word Philarchus, even if it were a happy term expressing a paternal and kindly authority, would prove nothing for the minister's Latin, whatever it might prove for his Greek. But it is clear that the word Philarchus means, not a man who rules by love, but a man who loves rule. The Attic writers of the best age used the word philarchos in the sense which we assign to it. Would Mr. Croker translate philosophos, a man who acquires wisdom by means of love, or philokerdes, a man who makes money by means of love? In fact, it requires no Bentley or Casaubon to perceive that Philarchus is merely a false spelling for Phylarchus, the chief of a tribe. Mr. Croker has favoured us with some Greek of his own. "At the altar," says Dr. Johnson, "I recommended my th ph." "These letters," says the editor, "(which Dr. Strahan seems not to have understood) probably mean phnetoi philoi, departed friends." [Vol. iv. 251. An attempt was made to vindicate this blunder by quoting a grossly corrupt passage from the Iketides of Euripides bathi kai antiason gonaton, epi kheira balousa, teknon te thnaton komisai demas. The true reading, as every scholar knows, is teknon, tethneoton komisai demas. Indeed without this emendation it would not be easy to construe the words, even if thnaton could bear the meaning which Mr. Croker assigns to it.] Johnson was not a first- rate Greek scholar; but he knew more Greek than most boys when they leave school; and no schoolboy could venture to use the word thnetoi in the sense which Mr. Croker ascribes to it without imminent danger of a flogging. Mr. Croker has also given us a specimen of his skill in translating Latin. Johnson wrote a note in which he consulted his friend, Dr. Lawrence, on the propriety of losing some blood. The note contains these words:--"Si per te licet, imperatur nuncio Holderum ad me deducere." Johnson should rather have written "imperatum est." But the meaning of the words is perfectly clear. "If you say yes, the messenger has orders to bring Holder to me." Mr. Croker translates the words as follows: "If you consent, pray tell the messenger to bring Holder to me." [v. 17.] If Mr. Croker is resolved to write on points of classical learning, we would advise him to begin by giving an hour every morning to our old friend Corderius. Indeed we cannot open any volume of this work in any place, and turn it over for two minutes in any direction, without lighting on a blunder. Johnson, in his Life of Tickell, stated that a poem entitled "The Royal Progress," which appears in the last volume of the Spectator, was written on the accession of George I. The word "arrival" was afterwards substituted for accession." "The reader will observe," says Mr. Croker, that the Whig term accession, which might imply legality, was altered into a statement of the simple fact of King George's arrival." [iv. 425.] Now Johnson, though a bigoted Tory, was not quite such a fool as Mr. Croker here represents him to be. In the Life of Granville, Lord Lansdowne, which stands a very few pages from the Life of Tickell, mention is made of the accession of Anne, and of the accession of George I. The word arrival was used in the Life of Tickell for the simplest of all reasons. It was used because the subject of the poem called "The Royal Progress" was the arrival of the king, and not his accession, which took place near two months before his arrival. The editor's want of perspicacity is indeed very amusing. He is perpetually telling us that he cannot understand something in the text which is as plain as language can make it. "Mattaire," said Dr. Johnson, "wrote Latin verses from time to time, and published a set in his old age, which he called Senilia, in which he shows so little learning or taste in writing, as to make Carteret a dactyl." [iv. 335.] Hereupon we have this note: "The editor does not understand this objection, nor the following observation." The following observation, which Mr. Croker cannot understand, is simply this: "In matters of genealogy," says Johnson, "it is necessary to give the bare names as they are. But in poetry and in prose of any elegance in the writing, they require to have inflection given to them." If Mr. Croker had told Johnson that this was unintelligible, the doctor would probably have replied, as he replied on another occasion, "I have found you a reason, sir; I am not bound to find you an understanding." Everybody who knows anything of Latinity knows that, in genealogical tables, Joannes Baro de Carteret, or Vice-comes de Carteret, may be tolerated, but that in compositions which pretend to elegance, Carteretus, or some other form which admits of inflection, ought to be used. All our readers have doubtless seen the two distichs of Sir William Jones, respecting the division of the time of a lawyer. One of the distichs is translated from some old Latin lines; the other is original. The former runs thus: "Six hours to sleep, to law's grave study six, Four spend in prayer, the rest on nature fix." Rather," says Sir William Jones, "Six hours to law, to soothing slumbers seven, Ten to the world allot, and all to heaven." The second couplet puzzles Mr. Croker strangely. "Sir William," says he, "has shortened his day to twenty-three hours, and the general advice of "all to heaven," destroys the peculiar appropriation of a certain period to religious exercises." [v. 233.] Now we did not think that it was in human dullness to miss the meaning of the lines so completely. Sir William distributes twenty-three hours among various employments. One hour is thus left for devotion. The reader expects that the verse will end with "and one to heaven." The whole point of the lines consist in the unexpected substitution of "all" for "one." The conceit is wretched enough, but it is perfectly intelligible, and never, we will venture to say, perplexed man, woman, or child before. Poor Tom Davies, after failing in business, tried to live by his pen. Johnson called him "an author generated by the corruption of a bookseller." This is a very obvious, and even a commonplace allusion to the famous dogma of the old physiologists. Dryden made a similar allusion to that dogma before Johnson was born. Mr. Croker, however, is unable to understand what the doctor meant. "The expression," he says, "seems not quite clear." And he proceeds to talk about the generation of insects, about bursting into gaudier life, and Heaven knows what. [Vol. iv. 323.] There is a still stranger instance of the editor's talent for finding out difficulty in what is perfectly plain. "No man," said Johnson, "can now be made a bishop for his learning and piety." "From this too just observation," says Boswell, "there are some eminent exceptions." Mr. Croker is puzzled by Boswell's very natural and simple language. "That a general observation should be pronounced too just, by the very person who admits that it is not universally just, is not a little odd." [2 iii. 228.] A very large proportion of the two thousand five hundred notes which the editor boasts of having added to those of Boswell and Malone consists of the flattest and poorest reflections, reflections such as the least intelligent reader is quite competent to make for himself, and such as no intelligent reader would think it worth while to utter aloud. They remind us of nothing so much as of those profound and interesting annotations which are pencilled by sempstresses and apothecaries' boys on the dog-eared margins of novels borrowed from circulating libraries; " How beautiful!" "Cursed prosy!" "I don't like Sir Reginald Malcolm at all." "I think Pelham is a sad dandy." Mr. Croker is perpetually stopping us in our progress through the most delightful narrative in the language, to observe that really Dr. Johnson was very rude, that he talked more for victory than for truth, that his taste for port wine with capillaire in it was very odd, that Boswell was impertinent, that it was foolish in Mrs. Thrale to marry the music-master; and so forth. We cannot speak more favourably of the manner in which the notes are written than of the matter of which they consist. We find in every page words used in wrong senses, and constructions which violate the plainest rules of grammar. We have the vulgarism of "mutual friend," for "common friend." We have "fallacy" used as synonymous with "falsehood." We have many such inextricable labyrinths of pronouns as that which follows: "Lord Erskine was fond of this anecdote; he told it to the editor the first time that he had the honour of being in his company." Lastly, we have a plentiful supply of sentences resembling those which we subjoin. "Markland, who, with Jortin and Thirlby, Johnson calls three contemporaries of great eminence." [iv. 377.] "Warburton himself did not feel, as Mr. Boswell was disposed to think he did, kindly or gratefully of Johnson." [iv. 415.] "It was him that Horace Walpole called a man who never made a bad figure but as an author." [ii. 461.] One or two of these solecisms should perhaps be attributed to the printer, who has certainly done his best to fill both the text and the notes with all sorts of blunders. In truth, he and the editor have between them made the book so bad, that we do not well see how it could have been worse. When we turn from the commentary of Mr. Croker to the work of our old friend Boswell, we find it not only worse printed than in any other edition with which we are acquainted, but mangled in the most wanton manner. Much that Boswell inserted in his narrative is, without the shadow of a reason, degraded to the appendix. The editor has also taken upon himself to alter or omit passages which he considers as indecorous. This prudery is quite unintelligible to us. There is nothing immoral in Boswell's book, nothing which tends to inflame the passions. He sometimes uses plain words. But if this be a taint which requires expurgation, it would be desirable to begin by expurgating the morning and evening lessons. The delicate office which Mr. Croker has undertaken he has performed in the most capricious manner. One strong, old-fashioned, English word, familiar to all who read their Bibles, is changed for a sober synonym in some passages, and suffered to stand unaltered in others. In one place a faint allusion made by Johnson to an indelicate subject, an allusion so faint that, till Mr. Croker's note pointed it out to us, we had never noticed it, and of which we are quite sure that the meaning would never be discovered by any of those for whose sake books are expurgated, is altogether omitted. In another place, a coarse and stupid jest of Dr. Taylor on the same subject, expressed in the broadest language, almost the only passage, as far as we remember, in all Boswell's book, which we should have been inclined to leave out, is suffered to remain. We complain, however, much more of the additions than of the omissions. We have half of Mrs. Thrale's book, scraps of Mr. Tyers, scraps of Mr. Murphy, scraps of Mr. Cradock, long prosings of Sir John Hawkins, and connecting observations by Mr. Croker himself, inserted into the midst of Boswell's text. To this practice we most decidedly object. An editor might as well publish Thucydides with extracts from Diodorus interspersed, or incorporate the Lives of Suetonius with the History and Annals of Tacitus. Mr. Croker tells us, indeed, that he has done only what Boswell wished to do, and was prevented from doing by the law of copyright. We doubt this greatly. Boswell has studiously abstained from availing himself of the information given by his rivals, on many occasions on which he might have cited them without subjecting himself to the charge of piracy. Mr. Croker has himself, on one occasion, remarked very justly that Boswell was unwilling to owe any obligation to Hawkins. But, be this as it may, if Boswell had quoted from Sir John and from Mrs. Thrale, he would have been guided by his own taste and judgment in selecting his quotations. On what Boswell quoted he would have commented with perfect freedom; and the borrowed passages, so selected, and accompanied by such comments, would have become original. They would have dovetailed into the work. No hitch, no crease, would have been discernible. The whole would appear one and indivisible.      "Ut per laeve severos Effundat junctura ungues." This is not the case with Mr. Croker's insertions. They are not chosen as Boswell would have chosen them. They are not introduced as Boswell would have introduced them. They differ from the quotations scattered through the original Life of Johnson, as a withered bough stuck in the ground differs from a tree skilfully transplanted with all its life about it. Not only do these anecdotes disfigure Boswell's book; they are themselves disfigured by being inserted in his book. The charm of Mrs. Thrale's little volume is utterly destroyed. The feminine quickness of observation, the feminine softness of heart, the colloquial incorrectness and vivacity of style, the little amusing airs of a half-learned lady, the delightful garrulity, the "dear Doctor Johnson," the "it was so comical," all disappear in Mr. Croker's quotations. The lady ceases to speak in the first person; and her anecdotes, in the process of transfusion, become as flat as Champagne in decanters, or Herodotus in Beloe's version. Sir John Hawkins, it is true, loses nothing; and for the best of reasons. Sir John Hawkins has nothing to lose. The course which Mr. Croker ought to have taken is quite clear. He should have reprinted Boswell's narrative precisely as Boswell wrote it; and in the notes or the appendix he should have placed any anecdote which he might have thought it advisable to quote from other writers. This would have been a much more convenient course for the reader, who has now constantly to keep his eye on the margin in order to see whether he is perusing Boswell, Mrs. Thrale, Murphy, Hawkins, Tyers, Cradock, or Mr. Croker. We greatly doubt whether even the Tour to the Hebrides ought to have been inserted in the midst of the Life. There is one marked distinction between the two works. Most of the Tour was seen by Johnson in manuscript. It does not appear that he ever saw any part of the Life. We love, we own, to read the great productions of the human mind as they were written. We have this feeling even about scientific treatises; though we know that the sciences are always in a state of progression, and that the alterations made by a modern editor in an old book on any branch of natural or political philosophy are likely to be improvements. Some errors have been detected by writers of this generation in the speculations of Adam Smith. A short cut has been made to much knowledge at which Sir Isaac Newton arrived through arduous and circuitous paths. Yet we still look with peculiar veneration on the Wealth of Nations and on the Principia, and should regret to see either of those great works garbled even by the ablest hands. But in works which owe much of their interest to the character and situation of the writers, the case is infinitely stronger. What man of taste and feeling can endure rifacimenti, harmonies, abridgments, expurgated editions? Who ever reads a stage-copy of a play when he can procure the original? Who ever cut open Mrs. Siddons's Milton? Who ever got through ten pages of Mr. Gilpin's translation of John Bunyan's Pilgrim into modern English? Who would lose, in the confusion of a Diatessaron, the peculiar charm which belongs to the narrative of the disciple whom Jesus loved? The feeling of a reader who has become intimate with any great original work is that which Adam expressed towards his bride: "Should God create another Eve, and I Another rib afford, yet loss of thee Would never from my heart." No substitute, however exquisitely formed, will fill the void left by the original. The second beauty may be equal or superior to the first; but still it is not she. The reasons which Mr. Croker has given for incorporating passages from Sir John Hawkins and Mrs. Thrale with the narrative of Boswell, would vindicate the adulteration of half the classical works in the language. If Pepys's Diary and Mrs. Hutchinson's Memoirs had been published a hundred years ago, no human being can doubt that Mr. Hume would have made great use of those books in his History of England. But would it, on that account, be judicious in a writer of our own times to publish an edition of Hume's History of England, in which large extracts from Pepys and Mrs. Hutchinson should be incorporated with the original text? Surely not. Hume's history, be its faults what they may, is now one great entire work, the production of one vigorous mind, working on such materials as were within its reach. Additions made by another hand may supply a particular deficiency, but would grievously injure the general effect. With Boswell's book the case is stronger. There is scarcely, in the whole compass of literature, a book which bears interpolation so ill. We know no production of the human mind which has so much of what may be called the race, so much of the peculiar flavour of the soil from which it sprang. The work could never have been written if the writer had not been precisely what he was. His character is displayed in every page, and this display of character gives a delightful interest to many passages which have no other interest. The Life of Johnson is assuredly a great, a very great work. Homer is not more decidedly the first of heroic poets, Shakspeare is not more decidedly the first of dramatists, Demosthenes is not more decidedly the first of orators, than Boswell is the first of biographers. He has no second. He has distanced all his competitors so decidedly that it is not worth while to place them. Eclipse is first, and the rest nowhere. We are not sure that there is in the whole history of the human intellect so strange a phaenomenon as this book. Many of the greatest men that ever lived have written biography. Boswell was one of the smallest men that ever lived, and he has beaten them all. He was, if we are to give any credit to his own account or to the united testimony of all who knew him, a man of the meanest and feeblest intellect. Johnson described him as a fellow who had missed his only chance of immortality by not having been alive when the Dunciad was written. Beauclerk used his name as a proverbial expression for a bore. He was the laughing-stock of the whole of that brilliant society which has owed to him the greater part of its fame. He was always laying himself at the feet of some eminent man, and begging to be spit upon and trampled upon. He was always earning some ridiculous nickname, and then "binding it as a crown unto him," not merely in metaphor, but literally. He exhibited himself, at the Shakspeare Jubilee, to all the crowd which filled Stratford-on-Avon, with a placard round his hat bearing the inscription of Corsica Boswell. In his Tour, he proclaimed to all the world that at Edinburgh he was known by the appellation of Paoli Boswell. Servile and impertinent, shallow and pedantic, a bigot and a sot, bloated with family pride, and eternally blustering about the dignity of a born gentleman, yet stooping to be a talebearer, an eavesdropper, a common butt in the taverns of London, so curious to know everybody who was talked about, that, Tory and High Churchman as he was, he manoeuvred, we have been told, for an introduction to Tom Paine, so vain of the most childish distinctions, that when he had been to Court, he drove to the office where his book was printing without changing his clothes, and summoned all the printer's devils to admire his new ruffles and sword; such was this man, and such he was content and proud to be. Everything which another man would have hidden, everything the publication of which would have made another man hang himself, was matter of gay and clamorous exultation to his weak and diseased mind. What silly things he said, what bitter retorts he provoked, how at one place he was troubled with evil presentiments which came to nothing, how at another place, on waking from a drunken doze, he read the prayer-book and took a hair of the dog that had bitten him, how he went to see men hanged and came away maudlin, how he added five hundred pounds to the fortune of one of his babies because she was not scared at Johnson's ugly face, how was frightened out of his wits at sea, and how the sailors quieted him as they would have quieted a child, how tipsy he was at Lady Cork's one evening and how much his merriment annoyed the ladies, how impertinent he was to the Duchess of Argyll and with what stately contempt she put down his impertinence, how Colonel Macleod sneered to his face at his impudent obtrusiveness, how his father and the very wife of his bosom laughed and fretted at his fooleries; all these things he proclaimed to all the world, as if they had been subjects for pride and ostentatious rejoicing. All the caprices of his temper, all the illusions of his vanity, all his hypochondriac whimsies, all his castles in the air, he displayed with a cool self- complacency, a perfect unconsciousness that he was making a fool of himself, to which it is impossible to find a parallel in the whole history of mankind. He has used many people ill; but assuredly he has used nobody so ill as himself. That such a man should have written one of the best books in the world is strange enough. But this is not all. Many persons who have conducted themselves foolishly in active life, and whose conversation has indicated no superior powers of mind, have left us valuable works. Goldsmith was very justly described by one of his contemporaries as an inspired idiot, and by another as a being "Who wrote like an angel, and talked like poor Poll." La Fontaine was in society a mere simpleton. His blunders would not come in amiss among the stories of Hierocles. But these men attained literary eminence in spite of their weaknesses. Boswell attained it by reason of his weaknesses. If he had not been a great fool, he would never have been a great writer. Without all the qualities which made him the jest and the torment of those among whom he lived, without the officiousness, the inquisitiveness, the effrontery, the toad-eating, the insensibility to all reproof, he never could have produced so excellent a book. He was a slave, proud of his servitude, a Paul Pry, convinced that his own curiosity and garrulity were virtues, an unsafe companion who never scrupled to repay the most liberal hospitality by the basest violation of confidence, a man without delicacy, without shame, without sense enough to know when he was hurting the feelings of others or when he was exposing himself to derision; and because he was all this, he has, in an important department of literature, immeasurably surpassed such writers as Tacitus, Clarendon, Alfieri, and his own idol Johnson. Of the talents which ordinarily raise men to eminence as writers, Boswell had absolutely none. There is not in all his books a single remark of his own on literature, politics, religion, or society, which is not either commonplace or absurd. His dissertations on hereditary gentility, on the slave-trade, and on the entailing of landed estates, may serve as examples. To say that these passages are sophistical would be to pay them an extravagant compliment. They have no pretence to argument, or even to meaning. He has reported innumerable observations made by himself in the course of conversation. Of those observations we do not remember one which is above the intellectual capacity of a boy of fifteen. He has printed many of his own letters, and in these letters he is always ranting or twaddling. Logic, eloquence, wit, taste, all those things which are generally considered as making a book valuable, were utterly wanting to him. He had, indeed, a quick observation and a retentive memory. These qualities, if he had been a man of sense and virtue would scarcely of themselves have sufficed to make him conspicuous; but because he was a dunce, a parasite, and a coxcomb, they have made him immortal. Those parts of his book which, considered abstractedly, are most utterly worthless, are delightful when we read them as illustrations of the character of the writer. Bad in themselves, they are good dramatically, like the nonsense of justice Shallow, the clipped English of Dr. Caius, or the misplaced consonants of Fluellen. Of all confessors, Boswell is the most candid. Other men who have pretended to lay open their own hearts, Rousseau, for example, and Lord Byron, have evidently written with a constant view to effect, and are to be then most distrusted when they seem to be most sincere. There is scarcely any man who would not rather accuse himself of great crimes and of dark and tempestuous passions than proclaim all his little vanities and wild fancies. It would be easier to find a person who would avow actions like those of Caesar Borgia, or Danton, than one who would publish a daydream like those of Alnaschar and Malvolio. Those weaknesses which most men keep covered up in the most secret places of the mind, not to be disclosed to the eye of friendship or of love, were precisely the weaknesses which Boswell paraded before all the world. He was perfectly frank, because the weakness of his understanding and the tumult of his spirits prevented him from knowing when he made himself ridiculous. His book resembles nothing so much as the conversation of the inmates of the Palace of Truth. His fame is great; and it will, we have no doubt, be lasting; but it is fame of a peculiar kind, and indeed marvellously resembles infamy. We remember no other case in which the world has made so great a distinction between a book and its author. In general, the book and the author are considered as one. To admire the book is to admire the author. The case of Boswell is an exception, we think the only exception, to this rule. His work is universally allowed to be interesting, instructive, eminently original: yet it has brought him nothing but contempt. All the world reads it, all the world delights in it: yet we do not remember ever to have read or ever to have heard any expression of respect and admiration for the man to whom we owe so much instruction and amusement. While edition after edition of his book was coming forth, his son, as Mr. Croker tells us, was ashamed of it, and hated to hear it mentioned. This feeling was natural and reasonable. Sir Alexander saw that in proportion to the celebrity of the work, was the degradation of the author. The very editors of this unfortunate gentleman's books have forgotten their allegiance, and, like those Puritan casuists who took arms by the authority of the king against his person, have attacked the writer while doing homage to the writings. Mr. Croker, for example, has published two thousand five hundred notes on the life of Johnson, and yet scarcely ever mentions the biographer, whose performance he has taken such pains to illustrate, without some expression of contempt. An ill-natured man Boswell certainly was not. Yet the malignity of the most malignant satirist could scarcely cut deeper than his thoughtless loquacity. Having himself no sensibility to derision and contempt, he took it for granted that all others were equally callous. He was not ashamed to exhibit himself to the whole world as a common spy, a common tattler, a humble companion without the excuse of poverty, and to tell a hundred stories of his own pertness and folly, and of the insults which his pertness and folly brought upon him. It was natural that he should show little discretion in cases in which the feelings or the honour of others might be concerned. No man, surely, ever published such stories respecting persons whom he professed to love and revere. He would infallibly have made his hero as contemptible as he has made himself, had not his hero really possessed some moral and intellectual qualities of a very high order. The best proof that Johnson was really an extraordinary man is that his character, instead of being degraded, has, on the whole, been decidedly raised by a work in which all his vices and weaknesses are exposed more unsparingly than they ever were exposed by Churchill or by Kenrick. Johnson grown old, Johnson in the fulness of his fame and in the enjoyment of a competent fortune, is better known to us than any other man in history. Everything about him, his coat, his wig, his figure, his face, his scrofula, his St. Vitus's dance, his rolling walk, his blinking eye, the outward signs which too clearly marked his approbation of his dinner, his insatiable appetite for fish-sauce and veal-pie with plums, his inextinguishable thirst for tea, his trick of touching the posts as he walked, his mysterious practice of treasuring up scraps of orange-peel, his morning slumbers, his midnight disputations, his contortions, his mutterings, his gruntings, his puffings, his vigorous, acute, and ready eloquence, his sarcastic wit, his vehemence, his insolence, his fits of tempestuous rage, his queer inmates, old Mr. Levett and blind Mrs. Williams, the cat Hodge and the negro Frank, all are as familiar to us as the objects by which we have been surrounded from childhood. But we have no minute information respecting those years of Johnson's life during which his character and his manners became immutably fixed. We know him, not as he was known to the men of his own generation, but as he was known to men whose father he might have been. That celebrated club of which he was the most distinguished member contained few persons who could remember a time when his fame was not fully established and his habits completely formed. He had made himself a name in literature while Reynolds and the Wartons were still boys. He was about twenty years older than Burke, Goldsmith, and Gerard Hamilton, about thirty years older than Gibbon, Beauclerk, and Langton, and about forty years older than Lord Stowell, Sir William Jones, and Windham. Boswell and Mrs. Thrale, the two writers from whom we derive most of our knowledge respecting him, never saw him till long after he was fifty years old, till most of his great works had become classical, and till the pension bestowed on him by the Crown had placed him above poverty. Of those eminent men who were his most intimate associates towards the close of his life, the only one, as far as we remember, who knew him during the first ten or twelve years of his residence in the capital, was David Garrick; and it does not appear that, during those years, David Garrick saw much of his fellow-townsman. Johnson came up to London precisely at the time when the condition of a man of letters was most miserable and degraded. It was a dark night between two sunny days. The age of patronage had passed away. The age of general curiosity and intelligence had not arrived. The number of readers is at present so great that a popular author may subsist in comfort and opulence on the profits of his works. In the reigns of William the Third, of Anne, and of George the First, even such men as Congreve and Addison would scarcely have been able to live like gentlemen by the mere sale of their writings. But the deficiency of the natural demand for literature was, at the close of the seventeenth and at the beginning of the eighteenth century, more than made up by artificial encouragement, by a vast system of bounties and premiums. There was, perhaps, never a time at which the rewards of literary merit were so splendid, at which men who could write well found such easy admittance into the most distinguished society, and to the highest honours of the State. The chiefs of both the great parties into which the kingdom was divided, patronised literature with emulous munificence. Congreve, when he had scarcely attained his majority, was rewarded for his first comedy with places which made him independent for life. Smith, though his Hippolytus and Phaedra failed, would have been consoled with three hundred a year but for his own folly. Rowe was not only Poet Laureate, but also land-surveyor of the customs in the port of London, clerk of the council to the Prince of Wales, and secretary of the Presentations to the Lord Chancellor. Hughes was secretary to the Commissions of the Peace. Ambrose Philips was judge of the Prerogative Court in Ireland. Locke was Commissioner of Appeals and of the Board of Trade. Newton was Master of the Mint. Stepney and Prior were employed in embassies of high dignity and importance. Gay, who commenced life as apprentice to a silk mercer, became a secretary of legation at five-and-twenty. It was to a poem on the death of Charles the Second, and to the City and Country Mouse, that Montague owed his introduction into public life, his earldom, his garter, and his Auditorship of the Exchequer. Swift, but for the unconquerable prejudice of the queen, would have been a bishop. Oxford, with his white staff in his hand, passed through the crowd of his suitors to welcome Parnell, when that ingenious writer deserted the Whigs. Steele was a commissioner of stamps and a member of Parliament. Arthur Mainwaring was a commissioner of the customs, and auditor of the imprest. Tickell was secretary to the Lords Justices of Ireland. Addison was Secretary of State. This liberal patronage was brought into fashion, as it seems, by the magnificent Dorset, almost the only noble versifier in the Court of Charles the Second who possessed talents for composition which were independent of the aid of a coronet. Montague owed his elevation to the favour of Dorset, and imitated through the whole course of his life the liberality to which he was himself so greatly indebted. The Tory leaders, Harley and Bolingbroke in particular, vied with the chiefs of the Whig party in zeal for the encouragement of letters. But soon after the accession of the House of Hanover a change took place. The supreme power passed to a man who cared little for poetry or eloquence. The importance of the House of Commons was constantly on the increase. The Government was under the necessity of bartering for Parliamentary support much of that patronage which had been employed in fostering literary merit; and Walpole was by no means inclined to divert any part of the fund of corruption to purposes which he considered as idle. He had eminent talents for governments and for debate. But he had paid little attention to books, and felt little respect for authors. One of the coarse jokes of his friend, Sir Charles Hanbury Williams, was far more pleasing to him than Thomson's Seasons or Richardson's Pamela. He had observed that some of the distinguished writers whom the favour of Halifax had turned into statesmen had been mere incumbrances to their party, dawdlers in office and mutes in Parliament. During the whole course of his administration, therefore, he scarcely befriended a single man of genius. The best writers of the age gave all their support to the Opposition, and contributed to excite that discontent which, after plunging the nation into a foolish and unjust war, overthrew the Minister to make room for men less able and equally immoral. The Opposition could reward its eulogists with little more than promises and caresses. St. James's would give nothing: Leicester House had nothing to give. Thus, at the time when Johnson commenced his literary career, a writer had little to hope from the patronage of powerful individuals. The patronage of the public did not yet furnish the means of comfortable subsistence. The prices paid by booksellers to authors were so low that a man of considerable talents and unremitting industry could do little more than provide for the day which was passing over him. The lean kine had eaten up the fat kine. The thin and withered ears had devoured the good ears. The season of rich harvest was over, and the period of famine had begun. All that is squalid and miserable might now be summed up in the word Poet. That word denoted a creature dressed like a scarecrow, familiar with compters and spunging-houses, and perfectly qualified to decide on the comparative merits of the Common Side in the King's Bench prison and of Mount Scoundrel in the Fleet. Even the poorest pitied him; and they well might pity him. For if their condition was equally abject, their aspirings were not equally high, nor their sense of insult equally acute. To lodge in a garret up four pair of stairs, to dine in a cellar among footmen out of place, to translate ten hours a day for the wages of a ditcher, to be hunted by bailiffs from one haunt of beggary and pestilence to another, from Grub Street to St. George's Fields, and from St. George's Fields to the alleys behind St. Martin's church, to sleep on a bulk in June and amidst the ashes of a glass-house in December, to die in an hospital, and to be buried in a parish vault, was the fate of more than one writer who, if he had lived thirty years earlier, would have been admitted to the sittings of the Kitcat or the Scriblerus Club, would have sat in Parliament, and would have been intrusted with embassies to the High Allies; who, if he had lived in our time, would have found encouragement scarcely less munificent in Albemarle Street or in Paternoster Row. As every climate has its peculiar diseases, so every walk of life has its peculiar temptations. The literary character, assuredly, has always had its share of faults, vanity, jealousy, morbid sensibility. To these faults were now superadded the faults which are commonly found in men whose livelihood is precarious, and whose principles are exposed to the trial of severe distress. All the vices of the gambler and of the beggar were blended with those of the author. The prizes in the wretched lottery of book- making were scarcely less ruinous than the blanks. If good fortune came, it came in such a manner that it was almost certain to be abused. After months of starvation and despair, a full third night or a well-received dedication filled the pocket of the lean, ragged, unwashed poet with guineas. He hastened to enjoy those luxuries with the images of which his mind had been haunted while he was sleeping amidst the cinders and eating potatoes at the Irish ordinary in Shoe Lane. A week of taverns soon qualified him for another year of night-cellars. Such was the life of Savage, of Boyse, and of a crowd of others. Sometimes blazing in gold-laced hats and waistcoats; sometimes lying in bed because their coats had gone to pieces, or wearing paper cravats because their linen was in pawn; sometimes drinking Champagne and Tokay with Betty Careless; sometimes standing at the window of an eating-house in Porridge island, to snuff up the scent of what they could not afford to taste; they knew luxury; they knew beggary; but they never knew comfort. These men were irreclaimable. They looked on a regular and frugal life with the same aversion which an old gipsy or a Mohawk hunter feels for a stationary abode, and for the restraints and securities of civilised communities. They were as untameable, as much wedded to their desolate freedom, as the wild ass. They could no more be broken in to the offices of social man than the unicorn could be trained to serve and abide by the crib. It was well if they did not, like beasts of a still fiercer race, tear the hands which ministered to their necessities. To assist them was impossible; and the most benevolent of mankind at length became weary of giving relief which was dissipated with the wildest profusion as soon as it had been received. If a sum was bestowed on the wretched adventurer, such as, properly husbanded, might have supplied him for six months, it was instantly spent in strange freaks of sensuality, and, before forty-eight hours had elapsed, the poet was again pestering all his acquaintance for twopence to get a plate of shin of beef at a subterraneous cookshop. If his friends gave him an asylum in their houses, those houses were forthwith turned into bagnios and taverns. All order was destroyed; all business was suspended. The most good-natured host began to repent of his eagerness to serve a man of genius in distress when he heard his guest roaring for fresh punch at five o'clock in the morning. A few eminent writers were more fortunate. Pope had been raised above poverty by the active patronage which, in his youth, both the great political parties had extended to his Homer. Young had received the only pension ever bestowed, to the best of our recollection, by Sir Robert Walpole, as the reward of mere literary merit. One or two of the many poets who attached themselves to the Opposition, Thomson in particular and Mallet, obtained, after much severe suffering, the means of subsistence from their political friends. Richardson, like a man of sense, kept his shop; and his shop kept him, which his novels, admirable as they are, would scarcely have done, But nothing could be more deplorable than the state even of the ablest men, who at that time depended for subsistence on their writings. Johnson, Collins, Fielding, and Thomson, were certainly four of the most distinguished persons that England produced during the eighteenth century. It is well known that they were all four arrested for debt. Into calamities and difficulties such as these Johnson plunged in his twenty-eighth year. From that time, till he was three or four and fifty, we have little information respecting him; little, we mean, compared with the full and accurate information which we possess respecting his proceedings and habits towards the close of his life. He emerged at length from cock-lofts and sixpenny ordinaries into the society of the polished and the opulent. His fame was established. A pension sufficient for his wants had been conferred on him: and he came forth to astonish a generation with which he had almost as little in common as with Frenchmen or Spaniards. In his early years he had occasionally seen the great; but he had seen them as a beggar. He now came among them as a companion. The demand for amusement and instruction had, during the course of twenty years, been gradually increasing. The price of literary labour had risen; and those rising men of letters with whom Johnson was henceforth to associate, were for the most part persons widely different from those who had walked about with him all night in the streets for want of a lodging. Burke, Robertson, the Wartons, Gray, Mason, Gibbon, Adam Smith, Beattie, Sir William Jones, Goldsmith, and Churchill, were the most distinguished writers of what may be called the second generation of the Johnsonian age. Of these men Churchill was the only one in whom we can trace the stronger lineaments of that character which, when Johnson first came up to London, was common among authors. Of the rest, scarcely any had felt the pressure of severe poverty. Almost all had been early admitted into the most respectable society on an equal footing. They were men of quite a different species from the dependants of Curll and Osborne. Johnson came among them the solitary specimen of a past age, the last survivor of the genuine race of Grub Street hacks; the last of that generation of authors whose abject misery and whose dissolute manners had furnished inexhaustible matter to the satirical genius of Pope. From nature he had received an uncouth figure, a diseased constitution, and an irritable temper. The manner in which the earlier years of his manhood had been passed had given to his demeanour, and even to his moral character, some peculiarities appalling to the civilised beings who were the companions of his old age. The perverse irregularity of his hours, the slovenliness of his person, his fits of strenuous exertion, interrupted by long intervals of sluggishness, his strange abstinence, and his equally strange voracity, his active benevolence, contrasted with the constant rudeness and the occasional ferocity of his manners in society, made him, in the opinion of those with whom he lived during the last twenty years of his life, a complete original. An original he was, undoubtedly, in some respects. But if we possessed full information concerning those who shared his early hardships, we should probably find that what we call his singularities of manner were, for the most part, failings which he had in common with the class to which he belonged. He ate at Streatham Park as he had been used to eat behind the screen at St. John's Gate, when he was ashamed to show his ragged clothes. He ate as it was natural that a man should eat, who, during a great part of his life, had passed the morning in doubt whether he should have food for the afternoon. The habits of his early life had accustomed him to bear privation with fortitude, but not to taste pleasure with moderation. He could fast; but, when he did not fast, he tore his dinner like a famished wolf, with the veins swelling on his forehead, and the perspiration running down his cheeks. He scarcely ever took wine. But when he drank it, he drank it greedily and in large tumblers. These were, in fact, mitigated symptoms of that same moral disease which raged with such deadly malignity in his friends Savage and Boyse. The roughness and violence which he showed in society were to be expected from a man whose temper, not naturally gentle, had been long tried by the bitterest calamities, by the want of meat, of fire, and of clothes, by the importunity of creditors, by the insolence of booksellers, by the derision of fools, by the insincerity of patrons, by that bread which is the bitterest of all food, by those stairs which are the most toilsome of all paths, by that deferred hope which makes the heart sick. Through all these things the ill-dressed, coarse, ungainly pedant had struggled manfully up to eminence and command. It was natural that, in the exercise of his power, he should be "eo immitior, quia toleraverat," that, though his heart was undoubtedly generous and humane, his demeanour in society should be harsh and despotic. For severe distress he had sympathy, and not only sympathy, but munificent relief. But for the suffering which a harsh word inflicts upon a delicate mind he had no pity; for it was a kind of suffering which he could scarcely conceive. He would carry home on his shoulders a sick and starving girl from the streets. He turned his house into a place of refuge for a crowd of wretched old creatures who could find no other asylum; nor could all their peevishness and ingratitude weary out his benevolence. But the pangs of wounded vanity seemed to him ridiculous: and he scarcely felt sufficient compassion even for the pangs of wounded affection. He had seen and felt so much of sharp misery, that he was not affected by paltry vexations; and he seemed to think that everybody ought to be as much hardened to those vexations as himself. He was angry with Boswell for complaining of a headache, with Mrs. Thrale for grumbling about the dust on the road, or the smell of the kitchen. These were, in his phrase, "foppish lamentations," which people ought to be ashamed to utter in a world so full of sin and sorrow. Goldsmith crying because The Good-natured Man had failed, inspired him with no pity. Though his own health was not good, he detested and despised valetudinarians. Pecuniary losses, unless they reduced the loser absolutely to beggary, moved him very little. People whose hearts had been softened by prosperity might weep, he said, for such events; but all that could be expected of a plain man was not to laugh. He was not much moved even by the spectacle of Lady Tavistock dying of a broken heart for the loss of her lord. Such grief he considered as a luxury reserved for the idle and the wealthy. A washerwoman, left a widow with nine small children, would not have sobbed herself to death. A person who troubled himself so little about small or sentimental grievances was not likely to be very attentive to the feelings of others in the ordinary intercourse of society. He could not understand how a sarcasm or a reprimand could make any man really unhappy. "My dear doctor," said he to Goldsmith, "what harm does it do to a man to call him Holofernes?" "Pooh, ma'am," he exclaimed, to Mrs. Carter, "who is the worse for being talked of uncharitably?" Politeness has been well defined as benevolence in small things. Johnson was impolite, not because he wanted benevolence, but because small things appeared smaller to him than to people who had never known what it was to live for fourpence halfpenny a day. The characteristic peculiarity of his intellect was the union of great powers with low prejudices. If we judged of him by the best parts of his mind, we should place him almost as high as he was placed by the idolatry of Boswell; if by the worst parts of his mind, we should place him even below Boswell himself. Where he was not under the influence of some strange scruple, or some domineering passion, which prevented him from boldly and fairly investigating a subject, he was a wary and acute reasoner, a little too much inclined to scepticism, and a little too fond of paradox. No man was less likely to be imposed upon by fallacies in argument, or by exaggerated statements of fact. But if, while he was beating down sophisms and exposing false testimony, some childish prejudices, such as would excite laughter in a well- managed nursery, came across him, he was smitten as if by enchantment. His mind dwindled away under the spell from gigantic elevation to dwarfish littleness. Those who had lately been admiring its amplitude and its force were now as much astonished at its strange narrowness and feebleness as the fisherman in the Arabian tale, when he saw the Genie, whose stature had overshadowed the whole seacoast, and whose might seemed equal to a contest with armies, contract himself to the dimensions of his small prison, and lie there the helpless slave of the charm of Solomon. Johnson was in the habit of sifting with extreme severity the evidence for all stories which were merely odd. But when they were not only odd but miraculous, his severity relaxed. He began to be credulous precisely at the point where the most credulous people begin to be sceptical. It is curious to observe, both in his writings and in his conversation, the contrast between the disdainful manner in which he rejects unauthenticated anecdotes, even when they are consistent with the general laws of nature, and the respectful manner in which he mentions the wildest stories relating to the invisible world. A man who told him of a water-spout, or a meteoric stone, generally had the lie direct given him for his pains. A man who told him of a prediction or a dream wonderfully accomplished was sure of a courteous hearing. "Johnson," observed Hogarth, "like King David, says in his haste that all men are liars." "His incredulity," says Mrs. Thrale, "amounted almost to disease." She tells us how he browbeat a gentleman, who gave him an account of a hurricane in the West Indies, and a poor Quaker who related some strange circumstance about the red-hot balls fired at the siege of Gibraltar. "It is not so. It cannot be true. Don't tell that story again. You cannot think how poor a figure you make in telling it." He once said, half-testingly, we suppose, that for six months he refused to credit the fact of the earthquake at Lisbon, and that he still believed the extent of the calamity to be greatly exaggerated. Yet he related with a grave face how old Mr. Cave of St. John's Gate saw a ghost, and how this ghost was something of a shadowy being. He went himself on a ghost-hunt to Cock Lane, and was angry with John Wesley for not following up another scent of the same kind with proper spirit and perseverance. He rejects the Celtic genealogies and poems without the least hesitation; yet he declares himself willing to believe the stories of the second sight. If he had examined the claims of the Highland seers with half the severity with which he sifted the evidence for the genuineness of Fingal, he would, we suspect, have come away from Scotland with a mind fully made up. In his Lives of the Poets, we find that he is unwilling to give credit to the accounts of Lord Roscommon's early proficiency in his studies: but he tells with great solemnity an absurd romance about some intelligence preternaturally impressed on the mind of that nobleman. He avows himself to be in great doubt about the truth of the story, and ends by warning his readers not wholly to slight such impressions. Many of his sentiments on religious subjects are worthy of a liberal and enlarged mind. He could discern clearly enough the folly and meanness of all bigotry except his own. When he spoke of the scruples of the Puritans, he spoke like a person who had really obtained an insight into the divine philosophy of the New Testament, and who considered Christianity as a noble scheme of government, tending to promote the happiness and to elevate the moral nature of man. The horror which the sectaries felt for cards, Christmas ale, plum-porridge, mince-pies, and dancing- bears, excited his contempt. To the arguments urged by some very worthy people against showy dress he replied with admirable sense and spirit, "Let us not be found, when our Master calls us, stripping the lace off our waistcoats, but the spirit of contention from our souls and tongues. Alas! sir, a man who cannot get to heaven in a green coat will not find his way thither the sooner in a grey one." Yet he was himself under the tyranny of scruples as unreasonable as those of Hudibras or Ralpho, and carried his zeal for ceremonies and for ecclesiastical dignities to lengths altogether inconsistent with reason or with Christian charity. He has gravely noted down in his diary that he once committed the sin of drinking coffee on Good Friday. In Scotland, he thought it his duty to pass several months without joining in public worship, solely because the ministers of the kirk had not been ordained by bishops. His mode of estimating the piety of his neighbours was somewhat singular. "Campbell," said he, "is a good man, a pious man. I am afraid he has not been in the inside of a church for many years: but he never passes a church without pulling off his hat; this shows he has good principles." Spain and Sicily must surely contain many pious robbers and well-principled assassins. Johnson could easily see that a Roundhead who named all his children after Solomon's singers, and talked in the House of Commons about seeking the Lord, might be an unprincipled villain, whose religious mummeries only aggravated his guilt. But a man who took off his hat when he passed a church episcopally consecrated must be a good man, a pious man, a man of good principles. Johnson could easily see that those persons who looked on a dance or a laced waistcoat as sinful, deemed most ignobly of the attributes of God and of the ends of revelation. But with what a storm of invective he would have overwhelmed any man who had blamed him for celebrating the redemption of mankind with sugarless tea and butterless buns. Nobody spoke more contemptuously of the cant of patriotism. Nobody saw more clearly the error of those who regarded liberty, not as a means, but as an end, and who proposed to themselves, as the object of their pursuit, the prosperity of the State: as distinct from the prosperity of the individuals who compose the State. His calm and settled opinion seems to have been that forms of government have little or no influence on the happiness of society. This opinion, erroneous as it is, ought at least to have preserved him from all intemperance on political questions. It did not, however, preserve him from the lowest, fiercest, and most absurd extravagances of party spirit, from rants which, in everything but the diction, resembled those of Squire Western. He was, as a politician, half ice and half fire. On the side of his intellect he was a mere Pococurante, far too apathetic about public affairs, far too sceptical as to the good or evil tendency of any form of polity. His passions, on the contrary, were violent even to slaying against all who leaned to Whiggish principles. The well-known lines which he inserted in Goldsmith's Traveller express what seems to have been his deliberate judgment: How small, of all that human hearts endure, That part which kings or laws can cause or cure! He had previously put expressions very similar into the mouth of Rasselas. It is amusing to contrast these passages with the torrents of raving abuse which he poured forth against the Long Parliament and the American Congress. In one of the conversations reported by Boswell this inconsistency displays itself in the most ludicrous manner. "Sir Adam Ferguson," says Boswell, "suggested that luxury corrupts a people, and destroys the spirit of liberty. JOHNSON: 'Sir, that is all visionary. I would not give half a guinea to live under one form of government rather than another. It is of no moment to the happiness of an individual. Sir, the danger of the abuse of power is nothing to a private man. What Frenchman is prevented passing his life as he pleases?' SIR ADAM: 'But, sir, in the British constitution it is surely of importance to keep up a spirit in the people, so as to preserve a balance against the Crown.' JOHNSON: 'Sir, I perceive you are a vile Whig. Why all this childish jealousy of the power of the Crown? The Crown has not power enough.'" One of the old philosophers, Lord Bacon tells us, used to say that life and death were just the same to him. "Why, then," said an objector, "do you not kill yourself?" The philosopher answered, "Because it is just the same." If the difference between two forms of government be not worth half a guinea, it is not easy to see how Whiggism can be viler than Toryism, or how the Crown can have too little power. If the happiness of individuals is not affected by political abuses, zeal for liberty is doubtless ridiculous. But zeal for monarchy must he equally so. No person could have been more quick-sighted than Johnson to such a contradiction as this in the logic of an antagonist. The judgments which Johnson passed on books were, in his own time, regarded with superstitious veneration, and, in our time, are generally treated with indiscriminate contempt. They are the judgments of a strong but enslaved understanding. The mind of the critic was hedged round by an uninterrupted fence of prejudices and superstitions. Within his narrow limits, he displayed a vigour and an activity which ought to have enabled him to clear the barrier that confined him. How it chanced that a man who reasoned on his premises so ably, should assume his premises so foolishly, is one of the great mysteries of human nature. The same inconsistency may be observed in the schoolmen of the middle ages. Those writers show so much acuteness and force of mind in arguing on their wretched data, that a modern reader is perpetually at a loss to comprehend how such minds came by such data. Not a flaw in the superstructure of the theory which they are rearing escapes their vigilance. Yet they are blind to the obvious unsoundness of the foundation. It is the same with some eminent lawyers. Their legal arguments are intellectual prodigies, abounding with the happiest analogies and the most refined distinctions. The principles of their arbitrary science being once admitted, the statute-book and the reports being once assumed as the foundations of reasoning, these men must be allowed to be perfect masters of logic. But if a question arises as to the postulates on which their whole system rests, if they are called upon to vindicate the fundamental maxims of that system which they have passed their lives in studying, these very men often talk the language of savages or of children. Those who have listened to a man of this class in his own court, and who have witnessed the skill with which he analyses and digests a vast mass of evidence, or reconciles a crowd of precedents which at first sight seem contradictory, scarcely know him again when, a few hours later, they hear him speaking on the other side of Westminster Hall in his capacity of legislator. They can scarcely believe that the paltry quirks which are faintly heard through a storm of coughing, and which do not impose on the plainest country gentleman, can proceed from the same sharp and vigorous intellect which had excited their admiration under the same roof, and on the same day. Johnson decided literary questions like a lawyer, not like a legislator. He never examined foundations where a point was already ruled. His whole code of criticism rested on pure assumption, for which he sometimes quoted a precedent or an authority, but rarely troubled himself to give a reason drawn from the nature of things. He took it for granted that the kind of poetry which flourished in his own time, which he had been accustomed to hear praised from his childhood, and which he had himself written with success, was the best kind of poetry. In his biographical work he has repeatedly laid it down as an undeniable proposition that during the latter part of the seventeenth century, and the earlier part of the eighteenth, English poetry had been in a constant progress of improvement. Waller, Denham, Dryden, and Pope, had been, according to him, the great reformers. He judged of all works of the imagination by the standard established among his own contemporaries. Though he allowed Homer to have been a greater man than Virgil, he seems to have thought the Aeneid a greater poem than the Iliad. Indeed, he well might have thought so; for he preferred Pope's Iliad to Homer's. He pronounced that, after Hoole's translation of Tasso, Fairfax's would hardly be reprinted. He could see no merit in our fine old English ballads, and always spoke with the most provoking contempt of Percy's fondness for them. Of the great original works of imagination which appeared during his time, Richardson's novels alone excited his admiration. He could see little or no merit in Tom Jones, in Gulliver's Travels, or in Tristram Shandy. To Thomson's Castle of Indolence he vouchsafed only a line of cold commendation, of commendation much colder than what he has bestowed on the Creation of that portentous bore, Sir Richard Blackmore. Gray was, in his dialect, a barren rascal. Churchill was a blockhead. The contempt which he felt for the trash of Macpherson was indeed just; but it was, we suspect, just by chance. He despised the Fingal for the very reason which led many men of genius to admire it. He despised it, not because it was essentially commonplace, but because it had a superficial air of originality. He was undoubtedly an excellent judge of compositions fashioned on his own principles. But when a deeper philosophy was required, when he undertook to pronounce judgment on the works of those great minds which "yield homage only to eternal laws," his failure was ignominious. He criticised Pope's Epitaphs excellently. But his observations on Shakspeare's plays and Milton's poems seem to us for the most part as wretched as if they had been written by Rymer himself, whom we take to have been the worst critic that ever lived. Some of Johnson's whims on literary subjects can be compared only to that strange nervous feeling which made him uneasy if he had not touched every post between the Mitre tavern and his own lodgings. His preference of Latin epitaphs to English epitaphs is an instance. An English epitaph, he said, would disgrace Smollett. He declared that he would not pollute the walls of Westminster Abbey with an English epitaph on Goldsmith. What reason there can be for celebrating a British writer in Latin, which there was not for covering the Roman arches of triumph with Greek inscriptions, or for commemorating the deeds of the heroes of Thermopylae in Egyptian hieroglyphics, we are utterly unable to imagine. On men and manners, at least on the men and manners of a particular place and a particular age, Johnson had certainly looked with a most observant and discriminating eye. His remarks on the education of children, on marriage, on the economy of families, on the rules of society, are always striking, and generally sound. In his writings, indeed, the knowledge of life which he possessed in an eminent degree is very imperfectly exhibited. Like those unfortunate chiefs of the middle ages who were suffocated by their own chain-mail and cloth of gold, his maxims perish under that load of words which was designed for their defence and their ornament. But it is clear from the remains of his conversation, that he had more of that homely wisdom which nothing but experience and observation can give than any writer since the time of Swift. If he had been content to write as he talked, he might have left books on the practical art of living superior to the Directions to Servants. Yet even his remarks on society, like his remarks on literature, indicate a mind at least as remarkable for narrowness as for strength. He was no master of the great science of human nature. He had studied, not the genus man, but the species Londoner. Nobody was ever so thoroughly conversant with all the forms of life and of all the shades of moral and intellectual character which were to be seen from Islington to the Thames, and from Hyde Park Corner to Mile-End Green. But his philosophy stopped at the first turnpike-gate. Of the rural life of England he knew nothing; and he took it for granted that everybody who lived in the country was either stupid or miserable. "Country gentlemen," said he, "must be unhappy; for they have not enough to keep their lives in motion;" as if all those peculiar habits and associations which made Fleet Street and Charing Cross the finest views in the world to himself had been essential parts of human nature. Of remote countries and past times he talked with wild and ignorant presumption. "The Athenians of the age of Demosthenes," he said to Mrs. Thrale, "were a people of brutes, a barbarous people." In conversation with Sir Adam Ferguson he used similar language. "The boasted Athenians," he said, "were barbarians. The mass of every people must be barbarous where there is no printing." The fact was this: he saw that a Londoner who could not read was a very stupid and brutal fellow: he saw that great refinement of taste and activity of intellect were rarely found in a Londoner who had not read much; and, because it was by means of books that people acquired almost all their knowledge in the society with which he was acquainted, he concluded, in defiance of the strongest and clearest evidence, that the human mind can be cultivated by means of books alone. An Athenian citizen might possess very few volumes; and the largest library to which he had access might be much less valuable than Johnson's bookcase in Bolt Court. But the Athenian might pass every morning in conversation with Socrates, and might hear Pericles speak four or five times every month. He saw the plays of Sophocles and Aristophanes; he walked amidst the friezes of Phidias and the paintings of Zeuxis: he knew by heart the choruses of Aeschylus: he heard the rhapsodist at the corner of the streets reciting the Shield of Achilles or the Death of Argus: he was a legislator, conversant with high questions of alliance, revenue, and war: he was a soldier, trained under a liberal and generous discipline: he was a judge compelled every day to weigh the effect of opposite arguments. These things were in themselves an education, an education eminently fitted, not, indeed, to form exact or profound thinkers, but to give quickness to the perceptions, delicacy to the taste, fluency to the expression, and politeness to the manners. All this was overlooked. An Athenian who did not improve his mind by reading was, in Johnson's opinion, much such a person as a Cockney who made his mark, much such a person as black Frank before he went to school, and far inferior to a parish clerk or a printer's devil. Johnson's friends have allowed that he carried to a ridiculous extreme his unjust contempt for foreigners. He pronounced the French to be a very silly people, much behind us, stupid, ignorant creatures. And this judgment he formed after having been at Paris about a month, during which he would not talk French, for fear of giving the natives an advantage over him in conversation. He pronounced them, also, to be an indelicate people, because a French footman touched the sugar with his fingers. That ingenious and amusing traveller, M. Simond, has defended his countrymen very successfully against Johnson's accusations, and has pointed out some English practices which, to an impartial spectator, would seem at least as inconsistent with physical cleanliness and social decorum as those which Johnson so bitterly reprehended. To the sage, as Boswell loves to call him, it never occurred to doubt that there must be something eternally and immutably good in the usages to which he had been accustomed. In fact, Johnson's remarks on society beyond the bills of mortality, are generally of much the same kind with those of honest Tom Dawson, the English footman in Dr. Moore's Zeluco. "Suppose the King of France has no sons, but only a daughter, then, when the king dies, this here daughter, according to that there law, cannot be made queen, but the next near relative, provided he is a man, is made king, and not the last king's daughter, which, to be sure, is very unjust. The French footguards are dressed in blue, and all the marching regiments in white, which has a very foolish appearance for soldiers; and as for blue regimentals, it is only fit for the blue horse or the artillery." Johnson's visit to the Hebrides introduced him to a state of society completely new to him; and a salutary suspicion of his own deficiencies seems on that occasion to have crossed his mind for the first time. He confessed, in the last paragraph of his journey, that his thoughts on national manners were the thoughts of one who had seen but little, of one who had passed his time almost wholly in cities. This feeling, however, soon passed away. It is remarkable that to the last he entertained a fixed contempt for all those modes of life and those studies which tend to emancipate the mind from the prejudices of a particular age or a particular nation. Of foreign travel and of history he spoke with the fierce and boisterous contempt of ignorance. "What does a man learn by travelling? Is Beauclerk the better for travelling? What did Lord Charlemont learn in his travels, except that there was a snake in one of the pyramids of Egypt?" History was, in his opinion, to use the fine expression of Lord Plunkett, an old almanack; historians could, as he conceived, claim no higher dignity than that of almanack-makers; and his favourite historians were those who, like Lord Hailes, aspired to no higher dignity. He always spoke with contempt of Robertson. Hume he would not even read. He affronted one of his friends for talking to him about Catiline's conspiracy, and declared that he never desired to hear of the Punic war again as long as he lived. Assuredly one fact which does not directly affect our own interests, considered in itself, is no better worth knowing than another fact. The fact that there is a snake in a pyramid, or the fact that Hannibal crossed the Alps, are in themselves as unprofitable to us as the fact that there is a green blind in a particular house in Threadneedle Street, or the fact that a Mr. Smith comes into the city every morning on the top of one of the Blackwall stages. But it is certain that those who will not crack the shell of history will never get at the kernel. Johnson, with hasty arrogance, pronounced the kernel worthless, because he saw no value in the shell. The real use of travelling to distant countries and of studying the annals of past times is to preserve men from the contraction of mind which those can hardly escape whose whole communion is with one generation and one neighbourhood, who arrive at conclusions by means of an induction not sufficiently copious, and who therefore constantly confound exceptions with rules, and accidents with essential properties. In short, the real use of travelling and of studying history is to keep men from being what Tom Dawson was in fiction, and Samuel Johnson in reality. Johnson, as Mr. Burke most justly observed, appears far greater in Boswell's books than in his own. His conversation appears to have been quite equal to his writings in matter, and far superior to them in manners. When he talked, he clothed his wit and his sense in forcible and natural expressions. As soon as he took his pen in his hand to write for the public, his style became systematically vicious. All his books are written in a learned language, in a language which nobody hears front his mother or his nurse, in a language in which nobody ever quarrels, or drives bargains, or makes love, in a language in which nobody ever thinks. It is clear that Johnson himself did not think in the dialect in which he wrote. The expressions which came first to his tongue were simple, energetic, and picturesque. When he wrote for publication, he did his sentences out of English into Johnsonese. His letters from the Hebrides to Mrs. Thrale are the original of that work of which the Journey to the Hebrides is the translation; and it is amusing to compare the two versions. "When we were taken upstairs," says he in one of his letters, "a dirty fellow bounced out of the bed on which one of us was to lie." This incident is recorded in the journey as follows: "Out of one of the beds on which we were to repose started up, at our entrance, a man black as a Cyclops from the forge." Sometimes Johnson translated aloud. "The Rehearsal," he said, very unjustly, "has not wit enough to keep it sweet" then, after a pause, "it has not vitality enough to preserve it from putrefaction." Mannerism is pardonable, and is sometimes even agreeable, when the manner, though vicious, is natural. Few readers, for example, would be willing to part with the mannerism of Milton or of Burke. But a mannerism which does not sit easy on the mannerist, which has been adopted on principle, and which can be sustained only by constant effort, is always offensive. And such is the mannerism of Johnson. The characteristic faults of his style are so familiar to all our readers, and have been so often burlesqued, that it is almost superfluous to point them out. It is well known that he made less use than any other eminent writer of those strong plain words, Anglo-Saxon or Norman-French, of which the roots lie in the inmost depths of our language; and that he felt a vicious partiality for terms which, long after our own speech had been fixed, were borrowed from the Greek and Latin, and which, therefore, even when lawfully naturalised, must be considered as born aliens, not entitled to rank with the king's English. His constant practice of padding out a sentence with useless epithets, till it became as stiff as the bust of an exquisite, his antithetical forms of expression, constantly employed even where there is no opposition in the ideas expressed, his big words wasted on little things, his harsh inversions so widely different from those graceful and easy inversions which give variety, spirit, and sweetness to the expression of our great old writers, all these peculiarities have been imitated by his admirers and parodied by his assailants, till the public have become sick of the subject. Goldsmith said to him, very wittily, and very justly, "If you were to write a fable about little fishes, doctor, you would make the little fishes talk like whales." No man surely ever had so little talent for personation as Johnson. Whether he wrote in the character of a disappointed legacy-hunter or an empty town fop, of a crazy virtuoso or a flippant coquette, he wrote in the same pompous and unbending style. His speech, like Sir Piercy Shafton's Euphuistic eloquence, betrayed him under every disguise. Euphelia and Rhodoclea talk as finely as Imlac the poet, or Seged, Emperor of Ethiopia. The gay Cornelia describes her reception at the country-house of her relations, in such terms as these: "I was surprised, after the civilities of my first reception, to find, instead of the leisure and tranquillity which a rural life always promises, and, if well conducted, might always afford, a confused wildness of care, and a tumultuous hurry of diligence, by which every face was clouded, and every motion agitated." The gentle Tranquilla informs us, that she "had not passed the earlier part of life without the flattery of courtship, and the joys of triumph; but had danced the round of gaiety amidst the murmurs of envy and the gratulations of applause, had been attended from pleasure to pleasure by the great, the sprightly, and the vain, and had seen her regard solicited by the obsequiousness of gallantry, the gaiety of wit, and the timidity of love." Surely Sir John Falstaff himself did not wear his petticoats with a worse grace. The reader may well cry out with honest Sir Hugh Evans, "I like not when a 'oman has a great peard: I spy a great peard under her muffler." [It is proper to observe that this passage bears a very close resemblance to a passage in the Rambler (No. 20). The resemblance may possibly be the effect of unconscious plagiarism.] We had something more to say. But our article is already too long; and we must close it. We would fain part in good humour from the hero, from the biographer, and even from the editor, who, ill as he has performed his task, has at least this claim to our gratitude, that he has induced us to read Boswell's book again. As we close it, the club-room is before us, and the table on which stands the omelet for Nugent, and the lemons for Johnson. There are assembled those heads which live for ever on the canvas of Reynolds. There are the spectacles of Burke and the tall thin form of Langton, the courtly sneer of Beauclerk and the beaming smile of Garrick, Gibbon tapping his snuff-box and Sir Joshua with his trumpet in his ear. In the foreground is that strange figure which is as familiar to us as the figures of those among whom we have been brought up, the gigantic body, the hugh massy face, seamed with the scars of disease, the brown coat, the black worsted stockings, the grey wig with the scorched foretop, the dirty hands, the nails bitten and pared to the quick. We see the eyes and mouth moving with convulsive twitches; we see the heavy form rolling; we hear it puffing; and then comes the "Why, sir!" and "What then, sir?" and the "No, sir!" and the "You don't see your way through the question, sir!" What a singular destiny has been that of this remarkable man! To be regarded in his own age as a classic, and in ours as a companion. To receive from his contemporaries that full homage which men of genius have in general received only from posterity! To be more intimately known to posterity than other men are known to their contemporaries! That kind of fame which is commonly the most transient is, in his case, the most durable. The reputation of those writings, which he probably expected to be immortal, is every day fading; while those peculiarities of manner and that careless table-talk the memory of which, he probably thought, would die with him, are likely to be remembered as long as the English language is spoken in any quarter of the globe. MADAME D'ARBLAY (January 1843) Diary and Letters of Madame D'Arblay. Five vols. 8vo. London: 1842. THOUGH the world saw and heard little of Madame D'Arblay during the last forty years of her life, and though that little did not add to her fame, there were thousands, we believe, who felt a singular emotion when they learned that she was no longer among us. The news of her death carried the minds of men back at one leap over two generations, to the time when her first literary triumphs were won. All those whom we had been accustomed to revere as intellectual patriarchs seemed children when compared with her; for Burke had sate up all night to read her writings, and Johnson had pronounced her superior to Fielding, when Rogers was still a schoolboy, and Southey still in petticoats. Yet more strange did it seem that we should just have lost one whose name had been widely celebrated before anybody had heard of some illustrious men, who, twenty, thirty, or forty years ago, were, after a long and splendid career, borne with honour to the grave. Yet so it was. Frances Burney was at the height of fame and popularity before Cowper had published his first volume, before Porson had gone up to college, before Pitt had taken his seat in the House of Commons, before the voice of Erskine had been once heard in Westminster Hall. Since the appearance of her first work, sixty-two years had passed; and this interval had been crowded, not only with political, but also with intellectual revolutions. Thousands of reputations had, during that period, sprung up, bloomed, withered, and disappeared. New kinds of composition had come into fashion, had gone out of fashion, had been derided, had been forgotten. The fooleries of Della Crusca, and the fooleries of Kotzebue, had for a time bewitched the multitude, and had left no trace behind them; nor had misdirected genius been able to save from decay the once flourishing schools of Godwin, of Darwin, and of Radcliffe. Many books, written for temporary effect, had run through six or seven editions, and had then been gathered to the novels of Afra Behn, and the epic poems of Sir Richard Blackmore. Yet the early works of Madame D'Arblay, in spite of the lapse of years, in spite of the change of manners, in spite of the popularity deservedly obtained by some of her rivals, continued to hold a high place in the public esteem. She lived to be a classic. Time set on her fame, before she went hence, that seal which is seldom set except on the fame of the departed. Like Sir Condy Rackrent in the tale, she survived her own wake, and overheard the judgment of posterity. Having always felt a warm and sincere, though not a blind admiration for her talents, we rejoiced to learn that her Diary was about to be made public. Our hopes, it is true, were not unmixed with fears. We could not forget the fate of the Memoirs of Dr. Burney, which were published ten years ago. That unfortunate book contained much that was curious and interesting. Yet it was received with a cry of disgust, and was speedily consigned to oblivion. The truth is, that it deserved its doom. It was written in Madame D'Arblay's later style, the worst style that has ever been known among men. No genius, no information, could save from proscription a book so written. We, therefore, opened the Diary with no small anxiety, trembling lest we should light upon some of that peculiar rhetoric which deforms almost every page of the Memoirs, and which it is impossible to read without a sensation made up of mirth, shame, and loathing. We soon, however, discovered to our great delight that this Diary was kept before Madame D'Arblay became eloquent. It is, for the most part, written in her earliest and best manner, in true woman's English, clear, natural, and lively. The two works are lying side by side before us; and we never turn from the Memoirs to the Diary without a sense of relief. The difference is as great as the difference between the atmosphere of a perfumer's shop, fetid with lavender water and jasmine soap, and the air of a heath on a fine morning in May. Both works ought to be consulted by every person who wishes to be well acquainted with the history of our literature and our manners. But to read the Diary is a pleasure; to read the Memoirs will always be a task. We may, perhaps, afford some harmless amusement to our readers, if we attempt, with the help of these two books, to give them an account of the most important years of Madame D'Arblay's life. She was descended from a family which bore the name of Macburney, and which, though probably of Irish origin, had been long settled in Shropshire, and was possessed of considerable estates in that county. Unhappily, many years before her birth, the Macburneys began, as if of set purpose and in a spirit of determined rivalry, to expose and ruin themselves. The heir apparent, Mr. James Macburney, offended his father by making a runaway match with an actress from Goodman's Fields. The old gentleman could devise no more judicious mode of wreaking vengeance on his undutiful boy than by marrying the cook. The cook gave birth to a son named Joseph, who succeeded to all the lands of the family, while James was cut off with a shilling. The favourite son, however, was so extravagant, that he soon became as poor as his disinherited brother. Both were forced to earn their bread by their labour. Joseph turned dancing-master, and settled in Norfolk. James struck off the Mac from the beginning of his name, and set up as a portrait painter at Chester. Here he had a son named Charles, well known as the author of the History of Music, and as the father of two remarkable children, of a son distinguished by learning, and of a daughter still more honourably distinguished by genius. Charles early showed a taste for that art, of which, at a later period, he became the historian. He was apprenticed to a celebrated musician in London, and applied himself to study with vigour and success. He soon found a kind and munificent patron in Fulk Greville, a highborn and highbred man, who seems to have had in large measure all the accomplishments and all the follies, all the virtues and all the vices, which, a hundred years ago, were considered as making up the character of a fine gentleman. Under such protection, the young artist had every prospect of a brilliant career in the capital. But his health failed. It became necessary for him to retreat from the smoke and river fog of London, to the pure air of the coast. He accepted the place of organist, at Lynn, and settled at that town with a young lady who had recently become his wife. At Lynn, in June 1752, Frances Burney was born. Nothing in her childhood indicated that she would, while still a young woman, have secured for herself an honourable and permanent place among English writers. She was shy and silent. Her brothers and sisters called her a dunce, and not without some show of reason; for at eight years old she did not know her letters. In 1760, Mr. Burney quitted Lynn for London, and took a house in Poland Street; a situation which had been fashionable In the reign of Queen Anne, but which, since that time, had been deserted by most of its wealthy and noble inhabitants. He afterwards resided in Saint Martin's Street, on the south side of Leicester Square. His house there is still well known, and will continue to be well known as long as our island retains any trace of civilisation; for it was the dwelling of Newton, and the square turret which distinguishes it from all the surrounding buildings was Newton's observatory. Mr. Burney at once obtained as many pupils of the most respectable description as he had time to attend, and was thus enabled to support his family, modestly indeed, and frugally, but in comfort and independence. His professional merit obtained for him the degree of Doctor of Music from the University of Oxford; and his works on subjects connected with his art gained for him a place, respectable, though certainly not eminent, among men of letters. The progress of the mind of Frances Burney, from her ninth to her twenty-fifth year, well deserves to be recorded. When her education had proceeded no further than the hornbook, she lost her mother, and thenceforward she educated herself. Her father appears to have been as bad a father as a very honest, affectionate, and sweet tempered man can well be. He loved his daughter dearly; but it never seems to have occurred to him that a parent has other duties to perform to children than that of fondling them. It would indeed have been impossible for him to superintend their education himself. His professional engagements occupied him all day. At seven in the morning he began to attend his pupils, and when London was full, was sometimes employed in teaching till eleven at night. He was often forced to carry in his pocket a tin box of sandwiches, and a bottle of wine and water, on which he dined in a hackney coach, while hurrying from one scholar to another. Two of his daughters he sent to a seminary at Paris; but he imagined that Frances would run some risk of being perverted from the Protestant faith if she were educated in a Catholic country, and he therefore kept her at home. No governess, no teacher of any art or of any language, was provided for her. But one of her sisters showed her how to write; and, before she was fourteen, she began to find pleasure in reading. It was not, however, by reading that her intellect was formed. Indeed, when her best novels were produced, her knowledge of books was very small. When at the height of her fame, she was unacquainted with the most celebrated works of Voltaire and Moliere; and, what seems still more extraordinary, had never heard or seen a line of Churchill, who, when she was a girl, was the most popular of living poets. It is particularly deserving of observation that she appears to have been by no means a novel- reader. Her father's library was large; and he had admitted into it so many books which rigid moralists generally exclude that he felt uneasy, as he afterwards owned, when Johnson began to examine the shelves. But in the whole collection there was only a single novel, Fielding's Amelia. An education, however, which to most girls would have been useless, but which suited Fanny's mind better than elaborate culture, was in constant progress during her passage from childhood to womanhood. The great book of human nature was turned over before her. Her father's social position was very peculiar. He belonged in fortune and station to the middle class. His daughters seemed to have been suffered to mix freely with those whom butlers and waiting-maids call vulgar. We are told that they were in the habit of playing with the children of a wig-maker who lived in the adjoining house. Yet few nobles could assemble in the most stately mansions of Grosvenor Square or Saint James's Square, a society so various and so brilliant as was sometimes to be found in Dr. Burney's cabin. His mind, though not very powerful or capacious, was restlessly active; and, in the intervals of his professional pursuits, he had contrived to lay up much miscellaneous information. His attainments, the suavity of his temper, and the gentle simplicity of his manners, had obtained for him ready admission to the first literary circles. While he was still at Lynn, he had won Johnson's heart by sounding with honest zeal the praises of the English Dictionary. In London the two friends met frequently, and agreed most harmoniously. One tie, indeed, was wanting to their mutual attachment. Burney loved his own art passionately; and Johnson just knew the bell of Saint Clement's church from the organ. They had, however, many topics in common; and on winter nights their conversations were sometimes prolonged till the fire had gone out, and the candles had burned away to the wicks. Burney's admiration of the powers which had produced Rasselas and The Rambler bordered on idolatry. Johnson, on the other hand, condescended to growl out that Burney was an honest fellow, a man whom it was impossible not to like. Garrick, too, was a frequent visitor in Poland Street and Saint Martin's Street. That wonderful actor loved the society of children, partly from good-nature, and partly from vanity. The ecstasies of mirth and terror, which his gestures and play of countenance never failed to produce in a nursery, flattered him quite as much as the applause of mature critics. He often exhibited all his powers of mimicry for the amusement of the little Burneys, awed them by shuddering and crouching as if he saw a ghost, scared them by raving like a maniac in Saint Luke's, and then at once became an auctioneer, a chimney-sweeper, or an old woman, and made them laugh till the tears ran down their cheeks. But it would be tedious to recount the names of all the men of letters and artists whom Frances Burney had an opportunity of seeing and hearing. Colman, Twining, Harris, Baretti, Hawkesworth, Reynolds, Barry, were among those who occasionally surrounded the tea-table and supper-tray at her father's modest dwelling. This was not all. The distinction which Dr. Burney had acquired as a musician, and as the historian of music, attracted to his house the most eminent musical performers of that age. The greatest Italian singers who visited England regarded him as the dispenser of fame in their art, and exerted themselves to obtain his suffrage. Pachierotti became his intimate friend. The rapacious Agujari, who sang for nobody else under fifty pounds an air, sang her best for Dr. Burney without a fee; and in the company of Dr. Burney even the haughty and eccentric Gabrielli constrained herself to behave with civility. It was thus in his power to give, with scarcely any expense, concerts equal to those of the aristocracy. On such occasions the quiet street in which he lived was blocked up by coroneted chariots, and his little drawing-room was crowded with peers, peeresses, ministers, and ambassadors. On one evening, of which we happen to have a full account, there were present Lord Mulgrave, Lord Bruce, Lord and Lady Edgecumbe, Lord Carrington from the War Office, Lord Sandwich from the Admiralty, Lord Ashburnham, with his gold key dangling from his pocket, and the French Ambassador, M. De Guignes, renowned for his fine person and for his success in gallantry. But the great show of the night was the Russian Ambassador, Count Orloff, whose gigantic figure was all in a blaze with jewels, and in whose demeanour the untamed ferocity of the Scythian might be discerned through a thin varnish of French politeness. As he stalked about the small parlour, brushing the ceiling with his toupee, the girls whispered to each other, with mingled admiration and horror, that he was the favoured lover of his august mistress; that he had borne the chief part in the revolution to which she owed her throne; and that his huge hands, now glittering with diamond rings, had given the last squeeze to the windpipe of her unfortunate husband. With such illustrious guests as these were mingled all the most remarkable specimens of the race of lions, a kind of game which is hunted in London every spring with more than Meltonian ardour and perseverance. Bruce, who had washed down steaks cut from living oxen with water from the fountains of the Nile, came to swagger and talk about his travels. Omai lisped broken English, and made all the assembled musicians hold their ears by howling Otaheitean love songs, such as those with which Oberea charmed her Opano. With the literary and fashionable society, which occasionally met under Dr. Burney's roof, Frances can scarcely be said to have mingled. She was not a musician, and could therefore bear no part in the concerts. She was shy almost to awkwardness, and scarcely ever joined in the conversation. The slightest remark from a stranger disconcerted her; and even the old friends of her father who tried to draw her out could seldom extract more than a Yes or a No. Her figure was small, her face not distinguished by beauty. She was therefore suffered to withdraw quietly to the background, and, unobserved herself, to observe all that passed. Her nearest relations were aware that she had good sense, but seem not to have suspected that, under her demure and bashful deportment, were concealed a fertile invention and a keen sense of the ridiculous. She had not, it is true, an eye for the fine shades of character. But every marked peculiarity instantly caught her notice and remained engraven on her imagination. Thus, while still a girl, she had laid up such a store of materials for fiction as few of those who mix much in the world are able to accumulate during a long life. She had watched and listened to people of every class, from princes and great officers of state down to artists living in garrets, and poets familiar with subterranean cookshops. Hundreds of remarkable persons had passed in review before her, English, French, German, Italian, lords and fiddlers, deans of cathedrals and managers of theatres, travellers leading about newly caught savages, and singing women escorted by deputy husbands. So strong was the impression made on the mind of Frances by the society which she was in the habit of seeing and hearing, that she began to write little fictitious narratives as soon as she could use her pen with case, which, as we have said, was not very early. Her sisters were amused by her stories: but Dr. Burney knew nothing of their existence; and in another quarter her literary propensities met with serious discouragement. When she was fifteen, her father took a second wife. The new Mrs. Burney soon found out that her stepdaughter was fond of scribbling, and delivered several good-natured lectures on the subject. The advice no doubt was well meant, and might have been given by the most judicious friend; for at that time, from causes to which we may hereafter advert, nothing could be more disadvantageous to a young lady than to be known as a novel-writer. Frances yielded, relinquished her favourite pursuit, and made a bonfire of all her manuscripts. [There is some difficulty here as to the chronology. "This sacrifice," says the editor of the Diary, "was made in the young authoress's fifteenth year." This could not be; for the sacrifice was the effect, according to the editor's own showing, of the remonstrances of the second Mrs. Burney; and Frances was in her sixteenth year when her father's second marriage took place.] She now hemmed and stitched from breakfast to dinner with scrupulous regularity. But the dinners of that time were early; and the afternoon was her own. Though she had given up novel- writing, she was still fond of using her pen. She began to keep a diary, and she corresponded largely with a person who seems to have had the chief share in the formation of her mind. This was Samuel Crisp, an old friend of her father. His name, well known, near a century ago, in the most splendid circles of London, has long been forgotten. His history is, however, so interesting and instructive, that it tempts us to venture on a digression. Long before Frances Burney was born, Mr. Crisp had made his entrance into the world, with every advantage. He was well connected and well educated. His face and figure were conspicuously handsome; his manners were polished; his fortune was easy; his character was without stain; he lived in the best society; he had read much; he talked well; his taste in literature, music, painting, architecture, sculpture, was held in high esteem. Nothing that the world can give seemed to be wanting to his happiness and respectability, except that he should understand the limits of his powers, and should not throw away distinctions which were within his reach in the pursuit of distinctions which were unattainable. "It is an uncontrolled truth," says Swift," that no man ever made an ill figure who understood his own talents, nor a good one who mistook them." Every day brings with it fresh illustrations of this weighty saying; but the best commentary that we remember is the history of Samuel Crisp. Men like him have their proper place, and it is a most important one, in the Commonwealth of Letters. It is by the judgment of such men that the rank of authors is finally determined. It is neither to the multitude, nor to the few who are gifted with great creative genius, that we are to look for sound critical decisions. The multitude, unacquainted with the best models, are captivated by whatever stuns and dazzles them. They deserted Mrs. Siddons to run after Master Betty; and they now prefer, we have no doubt, Jack Sheppard to Von Artevelde. A man of great original genius, on the other hand, a man who has attained to mastery in some high walk of art, is by no means to be implicitly trusted as a judge of the performances of others. The erroneous decisions pronounced by such men are without number. It is commonly supposed that jealousy makes them unjust. But a more creditable explanation may easily be found. The very excellence of a work shows that some of the faculties of the author have been developed at the expense of the rest; for it is not given to the human intellect to expand itself widely in all directions at once, and to be at the same time gigantic and well proportioned. Whoever becomes pre-eminent in any art, in any style of art, generally does so by devoting himself with intense and exclusive enthusiasm to the pursuit of one kind of excellence. His perception of other kinds of excellence is therefore too often impaired. Out of his own department he praises and blames at random, and is far less to be trusted than the mere connoisseur, who produces nothing, and whose business is only to judge and enjoy. One painter is distinguished by his exquisite finishing. He toils day after day to bring the veins of a cabbage leaf, the folds of a lace veil, the wrinkles of an old woman's face, nearer and nearer to perfection. In the time which he employs on a square foot of canvas, a master of a different order covers the walls of a palace with gods burying giants under mountains, or makes the cupola of a church alive with seraphim and martyrs. The more fervent the passion of each of these artists for his art, the higher the merit of each in his own line, the more unlikely it is that they will justly appreciate each other. Many persons who never handled a pencil probably do far more justice to Michael Angelo than would have been done by Gerard Douw, and far more justice to Gerard Douw than would have been done by Michael Angelo. It is the same with literature. Thousands, who have no spark of the genius of Dryden or Wordsworth, do to Dryden the justice which has never been done by Wordsworth, and to Wordsworth the justice which, we suspect, would never have been done by Dryden. Gray, Johnson, Richardson, Fielding, are all highly esteemed by the great body of intelligent and well informed men. But Gray could see no merit in Rasselas; and Johnson could see no merit in the Bard. Fielding thought Richardson a solemn prig; and Richardson perpetually expressed contempt and disgust for Fielding's lowness. Mr. Crisp seems, as far as we can judge, to have been a man eminently qualified for the useful office of a connoisseur. His talents and knowledge fitted him to appreciate justly almost every species of intellectual superiority. As an adviser he was inestimable. Nay, he might probably have held a respectable rank as a writer, if he would have confined himself to some department of literature in which nothing more than sense, taste, and reading was required. Unhappily he set his heart on being a great poet, wrote a tragedy in five acts on the death of Virginia, and offered it to Garrick, who was his personal friend. Garrick read, shook his head, and expressed a doubt whether it would be wise in Mr. Crisp to stake a reputation, which stood high, on the success of such a piece. But the author, blinded by ambition, set in motion a machinery such as none could long resist. His intercessors were the most eloquent man and the most lovely woman of that generation. Pitt was induced to read Virginia, and to pronounce it excellent. Lady Coventry with fingers which might have furnished a model to sculptors, forced the manuscript into the reluctant hand of the manager; and, in the year 1754, the play was brought forward. Nothing that skill or friendship could do was omitted. Garrick wrote both prologue and epilogue. The zealous friends of the author filled every box; and, by their strenuous exertions, the life of the play was prolonged during ten nights. But, though there was no clamorous reprobation, it was universally felt that the attempt had failed. When Virginia was printed, the public disappointment was even greater than at the representation. The critics, the Monthly Reviewers in particular, fell on plot, characters, and diction without mercy, but, we fear, not without justice. We have never met with a copy of the play; but, if we may judge from the scene which is extracted in the Gentleman's Magazine, and which does not appear to have been malevolently selected, we should say that nothing but the acting of Garrick, and the partiality of the audience, could have saved so feeble and unnatural a drama from instant damnation. The ambition of the poet was still unsubdued. When the London season closed, he applied himself vigorously to the work of removing blemishes. He does not seem to have suspected, what we are strongly inclined to suspect, that the whole piece was one blemish, and that the passages which were meant to be fine, were, in truth, bursts of that tame extravagance into which writers fall, when they set themselves to be sublime and pathetic in spite of nature. He omitted, added, retouched, and flattered himself with hopes of a complete success in the following year; but in the following year, Garrick showed no disposition to bring the amended tragedy on the stage. Solicitation and remonstrance were tried in vain. Lady Coventry, drooping under that malady which seems ever to select what is loveliest for its prey, could render no assistance. The manager's language was civily evasive; but his resolution was inflexible. Crisp had committed a great error; but he had escaped with a very slight penance. His play had not been hooted from the boards. It had, on the contrary, been better received than many very estimable performances have been, than Johnson's Irene, for example, or Goldsmith's Good-natured Man. Had Crisp been wise, he would have thought himself happy in having purchased self- knowledge so cheap. He would have relinquished, without vain repinings, the hope of poetical distinction, and would have turned to the many sources of happiness which he still possessed. Had he been, on the other hand, an unfeeling and unblushing dunce, he would have gone on writing scores of bad tragedies in defiance of censure and derision. But he had too much sense to risk a second defeat, yet too little sense to bear his first defeat like a man. The fatal delusion that he was a great dramatist, had taken firm possession of his mind. His failure he attributed to every cause except the true one. He complained of the ill-will of Garrick, who appears to have done for the play everything that ability and zeal could do, and who, from selfish motives, would, of course, have been well pleased if Virginia had been as successful as the Beggar's Opera. Nay, Crisp complained of the languor of the friends whose partiality had given him three benefit nights to which he had no claim. He complained of the injustice of the spectators, when, in truth, he ought to have been grateful for their unexampled patience. He lost his temper and spirits, and became a cynic and a hater of mankind. From London he retired to Hampton, and from Hampton to a solitary and long deserted mansion, built on a Common in one of the wildest tracts of Surrey. No road, not even a sheep-walk, connected his lonely dwelling with the abodes of men. The place of his retreat was strictly concealed from his old associates. In the spring he sometimes emerged, and was seen at exhibitions and concerts in London. But he soon disappeared, and hid himself with no society but his books, in his dreary hermitage. He survived his failure about thirty years. A new generation sprang up around him. No memory of his bad verses remained among men. His very name was forgotten. How completely the world had lost sight of him, will appear from a single circumstance. We looked for him in a copious Dictionary of Dramatic Authors published while he was still alive, and we found only that Mr. Henry Crisp, of the Custom House, had written a play called Virginia, acted in 1754. To the last, however, the unhappy man continued to brood over the injustice of the manager and the pit, and tried to convince himself and others that he had missed the highest literary honours, only because he had omitted some fine passages in compliance with Garrick's judgment. Alas for human nature, that the wounds of vanity should smart and bleed so much longer than the wounds of affection! Few people, we believe, whose nearest friends and relations died in 1754, had any acute feeling of the loss in 1782. Dear sisters, and favourite daughters, and brides snatched away before the honeymoon was passed, had been forgotten, or were remembered only with a tranquil regret. But Samuel Crisp was still mourning for his tragedy, like Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted. "Never," such was his language twenty-eight years after his disaster, "never give up or alter a tittle unless it perfectly coincides with your own inward feelings. I can say this to my sorrow and my cost. But mum!" Soon after these words were written, his life, a life which might have been eminently useful and happy, ended in the same gloom in which, during more than a quarter of a century, it had been passed. We have thought it worth while to rescue from oblivion this curious fragment of literary history. It seems to us at once ludicrous, melancholy, and full of instruction. Crisp was an old and very intimate friend of the Burneys. To them alone was confided the name of the desolate old hall in which he hid himself like a wild beast in a den. For them were reserved such remains of his humanity as had survived the failure of his play. Frances Burney he regarded as his daughter. He called her his Fannikin; and she in return called him her dear Daddy. In truth, he seems to have done much more than her real parents for the development of her intellect; for though he was a bad poet, he was a scholar, a thinker, and an excellent counsellor. He was particularly fond of the concerts in Poland Street. They had, indeed, been commenced at his suggestion, and when he visited London he constantly attended them. But when he grew old, and when gout, brought on partly by mental irritation, confined him to his retreat, he was desirous of having a glimpse of that gay and brilliant world from which he was exiled, and he pressed Fannikin to send him full accounts of her father's evening parties. A few of her letters to him have been published; and it is impossible to read them without discerning in them all the powers which afterwards produced Evelina and Cecilia, the quickness in catching every odd peculiarity of character and manner, the skill in grouping, the humour, often richly comic, sometimes even farcical. Fanny's propensity to novel-writing had for a time been kept down. It now rose up stronger than ever. The heroes and heroines of the tales which had perished in the flames, were still present to the eye of her mind. One favourite story, in particular, haunted her imagination. It was about a certain Caroline Evelyn, a beautiful damsel who made an unfortunate love-match, and died, leaving an infant daughter. Frances began to image to herself the various scenes, tragic and comic, through which the poor motherless girl, highly connected on one side, meanly connected on the other, might have to pass. A crowd of unreal beings, good and bad, grave and ludicrous, surrounded the pretty, timid, young orphan; a coarse sea captain; an ugly insolent fop, blazing in a superb court dress; another fop, as ugly and as insolent, but lodged on Snow Hill, and tricked out in second-hand finery for the Hampstead ball; an old woman, all wrinkles and rouge, flirting her fan with the air of a miss of seventeen, and screaming in a dialect made up of vulgar French and vulgar English; a poet lean and ragged, with a broad Scotch accent. By degrees these shadows acquired stronger and stronger consistence; the impulse which urged Frances to write became irresistible; and the result was the History of Evelina. Then came, naturally enough, a wish, mingled with many fears, to appear before the public; for, timid as Frances was, and bashful, and altogether unaccustomed to hear her own praises, it is clear that she wanted neither a strong passion for distinction, nor a just confidence in her own powers. Her scheme was to become, if possible, a candidate for fame, without running any risk of disgrace. She had not money to bear the expense of printing. It was therefore necessary that some bookseller should be induced to take the risk; and such a bookseller was not readily found. Dodsley refused even to look at the manuscript unless he were intrusted with the name of the author. A publisher in Fleet Street, named Lowndes, was more complaisant. Some correspondence took place between this person and Miss Burney, who took the name of Grafton, and desired that the letters addressed to her might be left at the Orange Coffee-house. But, before the bargain was finally struck, Fanny thought it her duty to obtain her father's consent. She told him that she had written a book, that she wished to have his permission to publish it anonymously, but that she hoped that he would not insist upon seeing it. What followed may serve to illustrate what we meant when we said that Dr. Burney was as bad a father as so good-hearted a man could possibly be. It never seems to have crossed his mind that Fanny was about to take a step on which the whole happiness of her life might depend, a step which might raise her to an honourable eminence, or cover her with ridicule and contempt. Several people had already been trusted, and strict concealment was therefore not to be expected. On so grave an occasion, it was surely his duty to give his best counsel to his daughter, to win her confidence, to prevent her from exposing herself if her book were a bad one, and, if it were a good one, to see that the terms which she had made with the publisher were likely to be beneficial to her. Instead of this, he only stared, burst out a- laughing, kissed her, gave her leave to do as she liked, and never even asked the name of her work. The contract with Lowndes was speedily concluded. Twenty pounds were given for the copyright, and were accepted by Fanny with delight. Her father's inexcusable neglect of his duty happily caused her no worse evil than the loss of twelve or fifteen hundred pounds. After many delays Evelina appeared in January 1778. Poor Fanny was sick with terror, and durst hardly stir out of doors. Some days passed before anything was heard of the book. It had, indeed, nothing but its own merits to push it into public favour. Its author was unknown. The house by which it was published was not, we believe, held in high estimation. No body of partisans had been engaged to applaud. The better class of readers expected little from a novel about a young lady's entrance into the world. There was, indeed, at that time a disposition among the most respectable people to condemn novels generally: nor was this disposition by any means without excuse; for works of that sort were then almost always silly, and very frequently wicked. Soon, however, the first faint accents of praise began to be heard. The keepers of the circulating libraries reported that everybody was asking for Evelina, and that some person had guessed Anstey to be the author. Then came a favourable notice in the London Review; then another still more favourable in the Monthly. And now the book found its way to tables which had seldom been polluted by marble-covered volumes. Scholars and statesmen, who contemptuously abandoned the crowd of romances to Miss Lydia Languish and Miss Sukey Saunter, were not ashamed to own that they could not tear themselves away from Evelina. Fine carriages and rich liveries, not often seen east of Temple Bar, were attracted to the publisher's shop in Fleet Street. Lowndes was daily questioned about the author, but was himself as much in the dark as any of the questioners. The mystery, however, could not remain a mystery long. It was known to brothers and sisters, aunts and cousins: and they were far too proud and too happy to be discreet. Dr. Burney wept over the book in rapture. Daddy Crisp shook his fist at his Fannikin in affectionate anger at not having been admitted to her confidence. The truth was whispered to Mrs. Thrale; and then it began to spread fast. The book had been admired while it was ascribed to men of letters long conversant with the world, and accustomed to composition. But when it was known that a reserved, silent young woman had produced the best work of fiction that had appeared since the death of Smollett, the acclamations were redoubled. What she had done was, indeed, extraordinary. But, as usual, various reports improved the story till it became miraculous. Evelina, it was said, was the work of a girl of seventeen. Incredible as this tale was, it continued to be repeated down to our own time. Frances was too honest to confirm it. Probably she was too much a woman to contradict it; and it was long before any of her detractors thought of this mode of annoyance. Yet there was no want of low minds and bad hearts in the generation which witnessed her first appearance. There was the envious Kenrick and the savage Wolcot, the asp George Steevens, and the polecat John Williams. It did not, however, occur to them to search the parish register of Lynn, in order that they might be able to twit a lady with having concealed her age. That truly chivalrous exploit was reserved for a bad writer of our own time, whose spite she had provoked by not furnishing him with materials for a worthless edition of Boswell's Life of Johnson, some sheets of which our readers have doubtless seen round parcels of better books. But we must return to our story. The triumph was complete. The timid and obscure girl found herself on the highest pinnacle of fame. Great men, on whom she had gazed at a distance with humble reverence, addressed her with admiration, tempered by the tenderness due to her sex and age. Burke, Windham, Gibbon, Reynolds, Sheridan, were among her most ardent eulogists. Cumberland acknowledged her merit, after his fashion, by biting his lips and wriggling in his chair whenever her name was mentioned. But it was at Streatham that she tasted, in the highest perfection, the sweets of flattery, mingled with the sweets of friendship. Mrs. Thrale, then at the height of prosperity and popularity, with gay spirits, quick wit, showy though superficial acquirements, pleasing though not refined manners, a singularly amiable temper, and a loving heart, felt towards Fanny as towards a younger sister. With the Thrales Johnson was domesticated. He was an old friend of Dr. Burney; but he had probably taken little notice of Dr. Burney's daughters, and Fanny, we imagine, had never in her life dared to speak to him, unless to ask whether he wanted a nineteenth or a twentieth cup of tea. He was charmed by her tale, and preferred it to the novels of Fielding, to whom, indeed, he had always been grossly unjust. He did not, indeed, carry his partiality so far as to place Evelina by the side of Clarissa and Sir Charles Grandison; yet he said that his little favourite had done enough to have made even Richardson feel uneasy. With Johnson's cordial approbation of the book was mingled a fondness, half gallant half paternal, for the writer; and this fondness his age and character entitled him to show without restraint. He began by putting her hand to his lips. But he soon clasped her in his huge arms, and implored her to be a good girl. She was his pet, his dear love, his dear little Burney, his little character-monger. At one time, he broke forth in praise of the good taste of her caps. At another time he insisted on teaching her Latin. That, with all his coarseness and irritability, he was a man of sterling benevolence, has long been acknowledged. But how gentle and endearing his deportment could be, was not known till the Recollections of Madame D'Arblay were published. We have mentioned a few of the most eminent of those who paid their homage to the author of Evelina. The crowd of inferior admirers would require a catalogue as long as that in the second book of the Iliad. In that catalogue would be Mrs. Cholmondeley, the sayer of odd things, and Seward, much given to yawning, and Baretti, who slew the man in the Haymarket, and Paoli, talking broken English, and Langton, taller by the head than any other member of the club, and Lady Millar, who kept a vase wherein fools were wont to put bad verses, and Jerningham who wrote verses fit to be put into the vase of Lady Millar, and Dr. Franklin, not, as some have dreamed, the great Pennsylvanian Dr. Franklin, who could not then have paid his respects to Miss Burney without much risk of being hanged, drawn and quartered, but Dr. Franklin the less, Aias Meion outi todos ge dsos Telamonios Aias Alla polu meion. It would not have been surprising if such success had turned even a strong head, and corrupted even a generous and affectionate nature. But, in the Diary, we can find no trace of any feeling inconsistent with a truly modest and amiable disposition. There is, indeed, abundant proof that Frances enjoyed with an intense, though a troubled joy, the honours which her genius had won; but it is equally clear that her happiness sprang from the happiness of her father, her sister, and her dear Daddy Crisp. While flattered by the great, the opulent, and the learned, while followed along the Steyne at Brighton, and the Pantiles at Tunbridge Wells, by the gaze of admiring crowds, her heart seems to have been still with the little domestic circle in Saint Martin's Street. If she recorded with minute diligence all the compliments, delicate and coarse, which she heard wherever she turned, she recorded them for the eyes of two or three persons who had loved her from infancy, who had loved her in obscurity, and to whom her fame gave the purest and most exquisite delight. Nothing can be more unjust than to confound these outpourings of a kind heart, sure of perfect sympathy, with the egotism of a bluestocking, who prates to all who come near her about her own novel or her own volume of sonnets. It was natural that the triumphant issue of Miss Burney's first venture should tempt her to try a second. Evelina, though it had raised her fame, had added nothing to her fortune. Some of her friends urged her to write for the stage. Johnson promised to give her his advice as to the composition. Murphy, who was supposed to understand the temper of the pit as well as any man of his time, undertook to instruct her as to stage effect. Sheridan declared that he would accept a play from her without even reading it. Thus encouraged, she wrote a comedy named The Witlings. Fortunately it was  never acted or printed. We can, we think, easily perceive, from the little which is said on the subject in the Diary, that The Witlings would have been damned, and that Murphy, and Sheridan thought so, though they were too polite to say so. Happily Frances had a friend who was not afraid to give her pain. Crisp, wiser for her than he had been for himself, read the manuscript in his lonely retreat, and manfully told her that she had failed, that to remove blemishes here and there would be useless, that the piece had abundance of wit but no interest, that it was bad as a whole, that it would remind every reader of the Femmes Savantes, which, strange to say, she had never read, and that she could not sustain so close a comparison with Moliere. This opinion, in which Dr. Burney concurred, was sent to Frances, in what she called "a hissing, groaning, catcalling epistle." But she had too much sense not to know that it was better to be hissed and cat-called by her Daddy, than by a whole sea of heads in the pit of Drury Lane Theatre: and she had too good a heart not to be grateful for so rare an act of friendship. She returned an answer, which shows how well she deserved to have a judicious, faithful, and affectionate adviser. "I intend," she wrote, "to console myself for your censure by this greatest proof I have ever received of the sincerity, candour, and, let me add, esteem, of my dear daddy. And as I happen to love myself more than my play, this consolation is not a very trifling one. This, however, seriously I do believe, that when my two daddies put their heads together to concert that hissing, groaning, cat-calling epistle they sent me, they felt as sorry for poor little Miss Bayes as she could possibly do for herself. You see I do not attempt to repay your frankness with an air of pretended carelessness. But, though somewhat disconcerted just now, I will promise not to let my vexation live out another day. Adieu, my dear daddy, I won't be mortified, and I won't be downed, but I will be proud to find I have, out of my own family, as well as in it, a friend who loves me well enough to speak plain truth to me." Frances now turned from her dramatic schemes to an undertaking far better suited to her talents. She determined to write a new tale, on a plan excellently contrived for the display of the powers in which her superiority to other writers lay. It was in truth a grand and various picture-gallery, which presented to the eye a long series of men and women, each marked by some strong peculiar feature. There were avarice and prodigality, the pride of blood and the pride of money, morbid restlessness and morbid apathy, frivolous garrulity, supercilious silence, a Democritus to laugh at everything, and a Heraclitus to lament over everything. The work proceeded fast, and in twelve months was completed. It wanted something of the simplicity which had been among the most attractive charms of Evelina; but it furnished ample proof that the four years, which had elapsed since Evelina appeared, had not been unprofitably spent. Those who saw Cecilia in manuscript pronounced it the best novel of the age. Mrs. Thrale laughed and wept over it. Crisp was even vehement in applause, and offered to ensure the rapid and complete success of the book for half-a-crown. What Miss Burney received for the copyright is not mentioned in the Diary; but we have observed several expressions from which we infer that the sum was considerable. That the sale would be great nobody could doubt; and Frances now had shrewd and experienced advisers, who would not suffer her to wrong herself. We have been told that the publishers gave her two thousand pounds, and we have no doubt that they might have given a still larger sum without being losers. Cecilia was published in the summer of 1782. The curiosity of the town was intense. We have been informed by persons who remember those days that no romance of Sir Walter Scott was more impatiently awaited, or more eagerly snatched from the counters of the booksellers. High as public expectation was, it was amply satisfied; and Cecilia was placed, by general acclamation, among the classical novels of England. Miss Burney was now thirty. Her youth had been singularly prosperous; but clouds soon began to gather over that clear and radiant dawn. Events deeply painful to a heart so kind as that of Frances followed each other in rapid succession. She was first called upon to attend the deathbed of her best friend, Samuel Crisp. When she returned to Saint Martin's Street, after performing this melancholy duty, she was appalled by hearing that Johnson had been struck by paralysis; and, not many months later, she parted from him for the last time with solemn tenderness. He wished to look on her once more; and on the day before his death she long remained in tears on the stairs leading to his bedroom, in the hope that she might be called in to receive his blessing. He was then sinking fast, and though he sent her an affectionate message, was unable to see her. But this was not the worst. There are separations far more cruel than those which are made by death. She might weep with proud affection for Crisp and Johnson. She had to blush as well as to weep for Mrs. Thrale. Life, however, still smiled upon Frances. Domestic happiness, friendship, independence, leisure, letters, all these things were hers; and she flung them all away. Among the distinguished persons to whom she had been introduced, none appears to have stood higher in her regard than Mrs. Delany. This lady was an interesting and venerable relic of a past age. She was the niece of George Granville, Lord Lansdowne, who, in his youth, exchanged verses and compliments with Edmund Waller, and who was among the first to applaud the opening genius of Pope. She had married Dr. Delany, a man known to his contemporaries as a profound scholar and an eloquent preacher, but remembered in our time chiefly as one of that small circle in which the fierce spirit of Swift, tortured by disappointed ambition, by remorse, and by the approaches of madness, sought for amusement and repose. Doctor Delany had long been dead. His widow, nobly descended, eminently accomplished, and retaining, in spite of the infirmities of advanced age, the vigour of her faculties and the serenity of her temper, enjoyed and deserved the favour of the royal family. She had a pension of three hundred a year; and a house at Windsor, belonging to the Crown, had been fitted up for her accommodation. At this house the King and Queen sometimes called, and found a very natural pleasure in thus catching an occasional glimpse of the private life of English families. In December 1785, Miss Burney was on a visit to Mrs. Delany at Windsor. The dinner was over. The old lady was taking a nap. Her grandniece, a little girl of seven, was playing at some Christmas game with the visitors, when the door opened, and a stout gentleman entered unannounced, with a star on his breast, and "What? what? what?" in his mouth. A cry of "The King!" was set up. A general scampering followed. Miss Burney owns that she could not have been more terrified if she had seen a ghost. But Mrs. Delany came forward to pay her duty to her royal friend, and the disturbance was quieted. Frances was then presented, and underwent a long examination and cross-examination about all that she had written and all that she meant to write. The Queen soon made her appearance and his Majesty repeated, for the benefit of his consort, the information which he had extracted from Miss Burney. The good-nature of the royal pair might have softened even the authors of the Probationary Odes, and could not but be delightful to a young lady who had been brought up a Tory. In a few days the visit was repeated. Miss Burney was more at ease than before. His Majesty, instead of seeking for information, condescended to impart it, and passed sentence on many great writers, English and foreign. Voltaire he pronounced a monster. Rousseau he liked rather better. "But was there ever," he cried, "such stuff as great part of Shakspeare? Only one must not say so. But what think you? What? Is there not sad stuff? What? What?" The next day Frances enjoyed the privilege of listening to some equally valuable criticism uttered by the Queen touching Goethe and Klopstock, and might have learned an important lesson of economy from the mode in which her Majesty's library had been formed. "I picked the book up on a stall," said the Queen. "Oh, it is amazing what good books there are on stalls!" Mrs. Delany, who seems to have understood from these words that her Majesty was in the habit of exploring the booths of Moorfields and Holywell Street in person, could not suppress an exclamation of surprise. "Why," said the Queen, "I don't pick them up myself. But I have a servant very clever; and, if they are not to be had at the booksellers, they are not for me more than for another." Miss Burney describes this conversation as delightful; and, indeed, we cannot wonder that, with her literary tastes, she should be delighted at hearing in how magnificent a manner the greatest lady in the land encouraged literature. The truth is, that Frances was fascinated by the condescending kindness of the two great personages to whom she had been presented. Her father was even more infatuated than herself. The result was a step of which we cannot think with patience, but which, recorded as it is, with all its consequences, in these volumes, deserves at least this praise, that it has furnished a most impressive warning. A German lady of the name of Haggerdorn, one of the keepers of the Queen's robes, retired about this time; and her Majesty offered the vacant post to Miss Burney. When we consider that Miss Burney was decidedly the most popular writer of fictitious narrative then living, that competence, if not opulence, was within her reach, and that she was more than usually happy in her domestic circle, and when we compare the sacrifice which she was invited to make with the remuneration which was held out to her, we are divided between laughter and indignation. What was demanded of her was that she should consent to be almost as completely separated from her family and friends as if she had gone to Calcutta, and almost as close a prisoner as if she had been sent to gaol for a libel; that with talents which had instructed and delighted the highest living minds, she should now be employed only in mixing snuff and sticking pins; that she should be summoned by a waiting-woman's bell to a waiting-woman's duties; that she should pass her whole life under the restraints of a paltry etiquette, should sometimes fast till she was ready to swoon with hunger, should sometimes stand till her knees gave way with fatigue; that she should not dare to speak or move without considering how her mistress might like her words and gestures. Instead of those distinguished men and women, the flower of all political parties, with whom she had been in the habit of mixing on terms of equal friendship, she was to have for her perpetual companion the chief keeper of the robes, an old hag from Germany, of mean understanding, of insolent manners, and of temper which, naturally savage, had now been exasperated by disease. Now and then, indeed, poor Frances might console herself for the loss of Burke's and Windham's society, by joining in the "celestial colloquy sublime" of his Majesty's Equerries. And what was the consideration for which she was to sell herself to this slavery? A peerage in her own right? A pension of two thousand a year for life? A seventy-four for her brother in the navy? A deanery for her brother in the church? Not so. The price at which she was valued was her board, her lodging, the attendance of a man-servant, and two hundred pounds a year. The man who, even when hard pressed by hunger, sells his birthright for a mess of pottage, is unwise. But what shall we say of him who parts with his birthright, and does not get even the pottage in return? It is not necessary to inquire whether opulence be an adequate compensation for the sacrifice of bodily and mental freedom; for Frances Burney paid for leave to be a prisoner and a menial. It was evidently understood as one of the terms of her engagement, that, while she was a member of the royal household, she was not to appear before the public as an author; and, even had there been no such understanding, her avocations were such as left her no leisure for any considerable intellectual effort. That her place was incompatible with her literary pursuits was indeed frankly acknowledged by the King when she resigned. "She has given up," he said, "five years of her pen." That during those five years she might, without painful exertion, without any exertion that would not have been a pleasure, have earned enough to buy an annuity for life much larger than the precarious salary which she received at Court, is quite certain. The same income, too, which in Saint Martin's Street would have afforded her every comfort, must have been found scanty at Saint James's. We cannot venture to speak confidently of the price of millinery and jewellery; but we are greatly deceived if a lady, who had to attend Queen Charlotte on many public occasions, could possibly save a farthing out of a salary of two hundred a year. The principle of the arrangement was, in short, simply this, that Frances Burney should become a slave, and should be rewarded by being made a beggar. With what object their Majesties brought her to their palace, we must own ourselves unable to conceive. Their object could not be to encourage her literary exertions; for they took her from a situation in which it was almost certain that she would write, and put her into a situation in which it was impossible for her to write. Their object could not be to promote her pecuniary interest; for they took her from a situation where she was likely to become rich, and put her into a situation in which she could not but continue poor. Their object could not be to obtain an eminently useful waiting-maid; for it is clear that, though Miss Burney was the only woman of her time who could have described the death of Harrel, thousands might have been found more expert in tying ribands and filling snuff-boxes. To grant her a pension on the civil list would have been an act of judicious liberality, honourable to the Court. If this was impracticable, the next best thing was to let her alone. That the King and Queen meant her nothing but kindness, we do not in the least doubt. But their kindness was the kindness of persons raised high above the mass of mankind, accustomed to be addressed with profound deference, accustomed to see all who approach them mortified by their coldness and elated by their smiles. They fancied that to be noticed by them, to be near them, to serve them, was in itself a kind of happiness; and that Frances Burney ought to be full of gratitude for being permitted to purchase, by the surrender of health, wealth, freedom, domestic affection, and literary fame, the privilege of standing behind a royal chair, and holding a pair of royal gloves. And who can blame them? Who can wonder that princes should be under such a delusion, when they are encouraged in it by the very persons who suffer from it most cruelly? Was it to be expected that George the Third and Queen Charlotte should understand the interest of Frances Burney better, or promote it with more zeal than herself and her father? No deception was practised. The conditions of the house of bondage were set forth with all simplicity. The hook was presented without a bait; the net was spread in sight of the bird: and the naked hook was greedily swallowed, and the silly bird made haste to entangle herself in the net. It is not strange indeed that an invitation to Court should have caused a fluttering in the bosom of an inexperienced young woman. But it was the duty of the parent to watch over the child, and to show her that on one side were only infantine vanities and chimerical hopes, on the other liberty, peace of mind, affluence, social enjoyments, honourable distinctions. Strange to say, the only hesitation was on the part of Frances. Dr. Burney was transported out of himself with delight. Not such are the raptures of a Circassian father who has sold his pretty daughter well to a Turkish slave-merchant. Yet Dr. Burney was an amiable man, a man of good abilities, a man who had seen much of the world. But he seems to have thought that going to Court was like going to heaven; that to see princes and princesses was a kind of beatific vision; that the exquisite felicity enjoyed by royal persons was not confined to themselves, but was communicated by some mysterious efflux or reflection to all who were suffered to stand at their toilettes, or to bear their trains. He overruled all his daughter's objections, and himself escorted her to her prison. The door closed. The key was turned. She, looking back with tender regret on all that she had left, and forward with anxiety and terror to the new life on which she was entering, was unable to speak or stand; and he went on his way homeward rejoicing in her marvellous prosperity. And now began a slavery of five years, of five years taken from the best part of life, and wasted in menial drudgery or in recreations duller than even menial drudgery, under galling restraints and amidst unfriendly or uninteresting companions. The history of an ordinary day was this. Miss Burney had to rise and dress herself early, that she might be ready to answer the royal bell, which rang at half after seven. Till about eight she attended in the Queen's dressing-room, and had the honour of lacing her august mistress's stays, and of putting on the hoop, gown, and neckhandkerchief. The morning was chiefly spent in rummaging drawers and laying fine clothes in their proper places. Then the Queen was to be powdered and dressed for the day. Twice a week her Majesty's hair was curled and craped; and this operation appears to have added a full hour to the business of the toilette. It was generally three before Miss Burney was at liberty. Then she had two hours at her own disposal. To these hours we owe great part of her Diary. At five she had to attend her colleague, Madame Schwellenberg, a hateful old toadeater, as illiterate as a chambermaid, as proud as a whole German Chapter, rude, peevish, unable to bear solitude, unable to conduct herself with common decency in society. With this delightful associate, Frances Burney had to dine, and pass the evening. The pair generally remained together from five to eleven, and often had no other company the whole time, except during the hour from eight to nine, when the equerries came to tea. If poor Frances attempted to escape to her own apartment, and to forget her wretchedness over a book, the execrable old woman railed and stormed, and complained that she was neglected. Yet, when Frances stayed, she was constantly assailed with insolent reproaches. Literary fame was, in the eyes of the German crone, a blemish, a proof that the person who enjoyed it was meanly born, and out of the pale of good society. All her scanty stock of broken English was employed to express the contempt with which she regarded the author of Evelina and Cecilia. Frances detested cards, and indeed knew nothing about them; but she soon found that the least miserable way of passing an evening with Madame Schwellenberg was at the card-table, and consented, with patient sadness, to give hours, which might have called forth the laughter and the tears of many generations, to the king of clubs and the knave of spades. Between eleven and twelve the bell rang again. Miss Burney had to pass twenty minutes or half an hour in undressing the Queen, and was then at liberty to retire, and to dream that she was chatting with her brother by the quiet hearth in Saint Martin's Street, that she was the centre of an admiring assemblage at Mrs. Crewe's, that Burke was calling her the first woman of the age, or that Dilly was giving her a cheque for two thousand guineas. Men, we must suppose, are less patient than women; for we are utterly at a loss to conceive how any human being could endure such a life, while there remained a vacant garret in Grub Street, a crossing in want of a sweeper, a parish workhouse, or a parish vault. And it was for such a life that Frances Burney had given up liberty and peace, a happy fireside, attached friends, a wide and splendid circle of acquaintance, intellectual pursuits in which she was qualified to excel, and the sure hope of what to her would have been affluence. There is nothing new under the sun. The last great master of Attic eloquence and Attic wit has left us a forcible and touching description of the misery of a man of letters, who, lured by hopes similar to those of Frances, had entered the service of one of the magnates of Rome. "Unhappy that I am," cries the victim of his own childish ambition: "would nothing content me but that I must leave mine old pursuits and mine old companions, and the life which was without care, and the sleep which had no limit save mine own pleasure, and the walks which I was free to take where I listed, and fling myself into the lowest pit of a dungeon like this? And, O God! for what? Was there no way by which I might have enjoyed in freedom comforts even greater than those which I now earn by servitude? Like a lion which has been made so tame that men may lead him about by a thread, I am dragged up and down, with broken and humbled spirit, at the heels of those to whom, in mine own domain, I should have been an object of awe and wonder. And, worst of all, I feel that here I gain no credit, that here I give no pleasure. The talents and accomplishments, which charmed a far different circle, are here out of place. I am rude in the arts of palaces, and can ill bear comparison with those whose calling, from their youth up, has been to flatter and to sue. Have I, then, two lives, that, after I have wasted one in the service of others, there may yet remain to me a second, which I may live unto myself?" Now and then, indeed, events occurred which disturbed the wretched monotony of Frances Burney's life. The Court moved from Kew to Windsor, and from Windsor back to Kew. One dull colonel went out of waiting, and another dull colonel came into waiting. An impertinent servant made a blunder about tea, and caused a misunderstanding between the gentlemen and the ladies. A half- witted French Protestant minister talked oddly about conjugal fidelity. An unlucky member of the household mentioned a passage in the Morning Herald, reflecting on the Queen; and forthwith Madame Schwellenberg began to storm in bad English, and told him that he made her "what you call perspire!" A more important occurrence was the King's visit to Oxford. Miss Burney went in the royal train to Nuneham, was utterly neglected there in the crowd, and could with difficulty find a servant to show the way to her bedroom, or a hairdresser to arrange her curls. She had the honour of entering Oxford in the last of a long string of carriages which formed the royal procession, of walking after the Queen all day through refectories and chapels, and of standing, half dead with fatigue and hunger, while her august mistress was seated at an excellent cold collation. At Magdalen College, Frances was left for a moment in a parlour, where she sank down on a chair. A good-natured equerry saw that she was exhausted, and shared with her some apricots and bread, which he had wisely put into his pockets. At that moment the door opened; the Queen entered; the wearied attendants sprang up; the bread and fruit were hastily concealed. "I found," says poor Miss Burney, "that our appetites were to be supposed annihilated, at the same moment that our strength was to be invincible." Yet Oxford, seen even under such disadvantages, "revived in her," to use her own words, "a consciousness to pleasure which had long lain nearly dormant." She forgot, during one moment, that she was a waiting-maid, and felt as a woman of true genius might be expected to feel amidst venerable remains of antiquity, beautiful works of art, vast repositories of knowledge, and memorials of the illustrious dead. Had she still been what she was before her father induced her to take the most fatal step of her life, we can easily imagine what pleasure she would have derived from a visit to the noblest of English cities. She might, indeed, have been forced to travel in a hack chaise, and might not have worn so fine a gown of Chambery gauze as that in which she tottered after the royal party; but with what delight would she have then paced the cloisters of Magdalen, compared the antique gloom of Merton with the splendour of Christ Church, and looked down from the dome of the Ratcliffe Library on the magnificent sea of turrets and battlements below! How gladly would learned men have laid aside for a few hours Pindar's Odes and Aristotle's Ethics to escort the author of Cecilia from college to college! What neat little banquets would she have found set out in their monastic cells! With what eagerness would pictures, medals, and illuminated missals have been brought forth from the most mysterious cabinets for her amusement! How much she would have had to hear and to tell about Johnson, as she walked over Pembroke, and about Reynolds, in the antechapel of New College! But these indulgences were not for one who had sold herself into bondage. About eighteen months after the visit to Oxford, another event diversified the wearisome life which Frances led at Court. Warren Hastings was brought to the bar of the House of Peers. The Queen and Princesses were present when the trial commenced, and Miss Burney was permitted to attend. During the subsequent proceedings a day rule for the same purpose was occasionally granted to her; for the Queen took the strongest interest in the trial, and when she could not go herself to Westminster Hall, liked to receive a report of what had passed from a person of singular powers of observation, and who was, moreover, acquainted with some of the most distinguished managers. The portion of the Diary which relates to this celebrated proceeding is lively and picturesque. Yet we read it, we own, with pain; for it seems to us to prove that the fine understanding of Frances Burney was beginning to feel the pernicious influence of a mode of life which is as incompatible with health of mind as the air of the Pomptine marshes with health of body. From the first day she espouses the cause of Hastings with a presumptuous vehemence and acrimony quite inconsistent with the modesty and suavity of her ordinary deportment. She shudders when Burke enters the Hall at the head of the Commons. She pronounces him the cruel oppressor of an innocent man. She is at a loss to conceive how the managers can look at the defendant, and not blush. Windham comes to her from the manager's box, to offer her refreshment. "But," says she, "I could not break bread with him." Then, again, she exclaims, "Ah, Mr. Windham, how can you ever engage in so cruel, so unjust a cause?" "Mr. Burke saw me," she says, "and he bowed with the most marked civility of manner." This, be it observed, was just after his opening speech, a speech which had produced a mighty effect, and which, certainly, no other orator that ever lived, could have made. "My curtsy," she continues, "was the most ungrateful, distant and cold; I could not do otherwise; so hurt I felt to see him the head of such a cause." Now, not only had Burke treated her with constant kindness, but the very last act which he performed on the day on which he was turned out of the Pay Office, about four years before this trial, was to make Dr. Burney organist of Chelsea Hospital. When, at the Westminster election, Dr. Burney was divided between his gratitude for this favour and his Tory opinions, Burke in the noblest manner disclaimed all right to exact a sacrifice of principle. "You have little or no obligations to me," he wrote; "but if you had as many as I really wish it were in my power, as it is certainly in my desire, to lay on you, I hope you do not think me capable of conferring them, in order to subject your mind or your affairs to a painful and mischievous servitude." Was this a man to be uncivilly treated by a daughter of Dr. Burney, because she chose to differ from him respecting a vast and most complicated question, which he had studied deeply during many years, and which she had never studied at all? It is clear, from Miss Burney's own narrative, that when she behaved so unkindly to Mr. Burke, she did not even know of what Hastings was accused. One thing, however, she must have known, that Burke had been able to convince a House of Commons, bitterly prejudiced against himself, that the charges were well founded, and that Pitt and Dundas had concurred with Fox and Sheridan, in supporting the impeachment. Surely a woman of far inferior abilities to Miss Burney might have been expected to see that this never could have happened unless there had been a strong case against the late Governor- General. And there was, as all reasonable men now admit, a strong case against him. That there were great public services to be set off against his great crimes is perfectly true. But his services and his crimes were equally unknown to the lady who so confidently asserted his perfect innocence, and imputed to his accusers, that is to say, to all the greatest men of all parties in the State, not merely error, but gross injustice and barbarity. She had, it is true, occasionally seen Mr. Hastings, and had found his manners and conversation agreeable. But surely she could not be so weak as to infer from the gentleness of his deportment in a drawing-room, that he was incapable of committing a great State crime, under the influence of ambition and revenge. A silly Miss, fresh from a boarding school, might fall into such a mistake; but the woman who had drawn the character of Mr. Monckton should have known better. The truth is that she had been too long at Court. She was sinking into a slavery worse than that of the body. The iron was beginning to enter into the soul. Accustomed during many months to watch the eye of a mistress, to receive with boundless gratitude the slightest mark of royal condescension, to feel wretched at every symptom of royal displeasure, to associate only with spirits long tamed and broken in, she was degenerating into something fit for her place. Queen Charlotte was a violent partisan of Hastings, had received presents from him, and had so far departed from the severity of her virtue as to lend her countenance to his wife, whose conduct had certainly been as reprehensible as that of any of the frail beauties who were then rigidly excluded from the English Court. The King, it was well known, took the same side. To the King and Queen all the members of the household looked submissively for guidance. The impeachment, therefore, was an atrocious persecution; the managers were rascals; the defendant was the most deserving and the worst used man in the kingdom. This was the cant of the whole palace, from Gold Stick in Waiting, down to the Table-Deckers and Yeoman of the Silver Scullery; and Miss Burney canted like the rest, though in livelier tones, and with less bitter feelings. The account which she has given of the King's illness contains much excellent narrative and description, and will, we think, be as much valued by the historians of a future age as any equal portion of Pepys's or Evelyn's Diaries. That account shows also how affectionate and compassionate her nature was. But it shows also, we must say, that her way of life was rapidly impairing her powers of reasoning and her sense of justice. We do not mean to discuss, in this place, the question, whether the views of Mr. Pitt or those of Mr. Fox respecting the regency were the more correct. It is, indeed, quite needless to discuss that question: for the censure of Miss Burney falls alike on Pitt and Fox, on majority and minority. She is angry with the House of Commons for presuming to inquire whether the King was mad or not, and whether there was a chance of his recovering his senses. "A melancholy day," she writes; "news bad both at home and, abroad. At home the dear unhappy king still worse; abroad new examinations voted of the physicians. Good heavens! what an insult does this seem from Parliamentary power, to investigate and bring forth to the world every circumstance of such a malady as is ever held sacred to secrecy in the most private families! How indignant we all feel here, no words can say." It is proper to observe, that the motion which roused all this indignation at Kew was made by Mr. Pitt himself. We see, therefore, that the loyalty of the Minister, who was then generally regarded as the most heroic champion of his Prince, was lukewarm indeed when compared with the boiling zeal which filled the pages of the backstairs and the women of the bedchamber. Of the Regency Bill, Pitt's own bill, Miss Burney speaks with horror. "I shuddered," she says, to hear it named." And again, "Oh, how dreadful will be the day when that unhappy bill takes place! I cannot approve the plan of it." The truth is that Mr. Pitt, whether a wise and upright statesman or not, was a statesman; and whatever motives he might have for imposing restrictions on the regent, felt that in some way or other there must be some provision made for the execution of some part of the kingly office, or that no government would be left in the country. But this was a matter of which the household never thought. It never occurred, as far as we can see, to the Exons and Keepers of the Robes, that it was necessary that there should be somewhere or other a power in the State to pass laws, to preserve order, to pardon criminals, to fill up offices, to negotiate with foreign governments, to command the army and navy. Nay, these enlightened politicians, and Miss Burney among the rest, seem to have thought that any person who considered the subject with reference to the public interest, showed himself to be a bad-hearted man. Nobody wonders at this in a gentleman usher; but it is melancholy to see genius sinking into such debasement. During more than two years after the King's recovery, Frances dragged on a miserable existence at the palace. The consolations which had for a time mitigated the wretchedness of servitude were one by one withdrawn. Mrs. Delany, whose society had been a great resource when the Court was at Windsor, was now dead. One of the gentlemen of the royal establishment, Colonel Digby, appears to have been a man of sense, of taste, of some reading, and of prepossessing manners. Agreeable associates were scarce in the prison house, and he and Miss Burney therefore naturally became attached to each other. She owns that she valued him as a friend; and it would not have been strange if his attentions had led her to entertain for him a sentiment warmer than friendship. He quitted the Court, and married in a way which astonished Miss Burney greatly, and which evidently wounded her feelings, and lowered him in her esteem. The palace grew duller and duller; Madame Schwellenberg became more and more savage and insolent; and now the health of poor Frances began to give way; and all who saw her pale face, her emaciated figure, and her feeble walk, predicted that her sufferings would soon be over. Frances uniformly speaks of her royal mistress, and of the princesses, with respect and affection. The princesses seem to have well deserved all the praise which is bestowed on them in the Diary. They were, we doubt not, most amiable women.  But "the sweet Queen," as she is constantly called in these volumes, is not by any means an object of admiration to us. She had undoubtedly sense enough to know what kind of deportment suited her high station, and self-command enough to maintain that deportment invariably. She was, in her intercourse with Miss Burney, generally gracious and affable, sometimes, when displeased, cold and reserved, but never, under any circumstances, rude, peevish, or violent. She knew how to dispense, gracefully and skilfully, those little civilities which, when paid by a sovereign, are prized at many times their intrinsic value; how to pay a compliment; how to lend a book; how to ask after a relation. But she seems to have been utterly regardless of the comfort, the health, the life of her attendants, when her own convenience was concerned. Weak, feverish, hardly able to stand, Frances had still to rise before seven, in order to dress the sweet Queen, and to sit up till midnight, in order to undress the sweet Queen. The indisposition of the handmaid could not, and did not, escape the notice of her royal mistress. But the established doctrine of the Court was, that all sickness was to be considered as a pretence until it proved fatal. The only way in which the invalid could clear herself from the suspicion of malingering, as it is called in the army, was to go on lacing and unlacing till she fell down dead at the royal feet. "This," Miss Burney wrote, when she was suffering cruelly from sickness, watching, and labour, "is by no means from hardness of heart; far otherwise. There is no hardness of heart in any one of them; but it is prejudice, and want of personal experience." Many strangers sympathised with the bodily and mental sufferings of this distinguished woman. All who saw her saw that her frame was sinking, that her heart was breaking. The last, it should seem, to observe the change was her father. At length, in spite of himself, his eyes were opened. In May 1790, his daughter had an interview of three hours with him, the only long interview which they had had since he took her to Windsor in 1786. She told him that she was miserable, that she was worn with attendance and want of sleep, that she had no comfort in life, nothing to love, nothing to hope, that her family and her friends were to her as though they were not, and were remembered by her as men remember the dead. From daybreak to midnight the same killing labour, the same recreations, more hateful than labour itself, followed each other without variety, without any interval of liberty and repose. The Doctor was greatly dejected by this news; but was too good- natured a man not to say that, if she wished to resign, his house and arms were open to her. Still, however, he could not bear to remove her from the Court. His veneration for royalty amounted in truth to idolatry. It can be compared only to the grovelling superstition of those Syrian devotees who made their children pass through the fire to Moloch. When he induced his daughter to accept the place of keeper of the robes, he entertained, as she tells us, a hope that some worldly advantage or other, not set down in the contract of service, would be the result of her connection with the Court. What advantage he expected we do not know, nor did he probably know himself. But, whatever he expected, he certainly got nothing. Miss Burney had been hired for board, lodging, and two hundred a year. Board, lodging, and two hundred a year, she had duly received. We have looked carefully through the Diary, in the hope of finding some trace of those extraordinary benefactions on which the Doctor reckoned. But we can discover only a promise, never performed, of a gown: and for this promise Miss Burney was expected to return thanks, such as might have suited the beggar with whom Saint Martin, in the legend, divided his cloak. The experience of four years was, however, insufficient to dispel the illusion which had taken possession of the Doctor's mind; and between the dear father and the sweet Queen, there seemed to be little doubt that some day or other Frances would drop down a corpse. Six months had elapsed since the interview between the parent and the daughter. The resignation was not sent in. The sufferer grew worse and worse. She took bark; but it soon ceased to produce a beneficial effect. She was stimulated with wine; she was soothed with opium; but in vain. Her breath began to fail. The whisper that she was in a decline spread through the Court. The pains in her side became so severe that she was forced to crawl from the card-table of the old Fury to whom she was tethered, three or four times in an evening for the purpose of taking hartshorn. Had she been a negro slave, a humane planter would have excused her from work. But her Majesty showed no mercy. Thrice a day the accursed bell still rang; the Queen was still to be dressed for the morning at seven, and to be dressed for the day at noon, and to be undressed at midnight. But there had arisen, in literary and fashionable society, a general feeling of compassion for Miss Burney, and of indignation against both her father and the Queen. "Is it possible," said a great French lady to the Doctor, "that your daughter is in a situation where she is never allowed a holiday?" Horace Walpole wrote to Frances, to express his sympathy. Boswell, boiling over with good-natured rage, almost forced an entrance into the palace to see her. "My dear ma'am, why do you stay? It won't do, ma'am; you must resign. We can put up with it no longer. Some very violent measures, I assure you, will be taken. We shall address Dr. Burney in a body." Burke and Reynolds, though less noisy, were zealous in the same cause. Windham spoke to Dr. Burney; but found him still irresolute. "I will set the club upon him," cried Windham; "Miss Burney has some very true admirers there, and I am sure they will eagerly assist." Indeed the Burney family seem to have been apprehensive that some public affront such as the Doctor's unpardonable folly, to use the mildest term, had richly deserved, would be put upon him. The medical men spoke out, and plainly told him that his daughter must resign or die. At last paternal affection, medical authority, and the voice of all London crying shame, triumphed over Dr. Burney's love of courts. He determined that Frances should write a letter of resignation. It was with difficulty that, though her life was at stake, she mustered spirit to put the paper into the Queen's hands. "I could not," so runs the Diary, "summon courage to present my memorial; my heart always failed me from seeing the Queen's entire freedom from such an expectation. For though I was frequently so ill in her presence that I could hardly stand, I saw she concluded me, while life remained, inevitably hers." At last with a trembling hand the paper was delivered. Then came the storm. Juno, as in the Aeneid, delegated the work of vengeance to Alecto. The Queen was calm and gentle; but Madame Schwellenberg raved like a maniac in the incurable ward of Bedlam! Such insolence! Such ingratitude! Such folly! Would Miss Burney bring utter destruction on herself and her family? Would she throw away the inestimable advantage of royal protection? Would she part with privileges which, once relinquished, could never be regained? It was idle to talk of health and life. If people could not live in the palace, the best thing that could befall them was to die in it. The resignation was not accepted. The language of the medical men became stronger and stronger. Dr. Burney's parental fears were fully roused; and he explicitly declared, in a letter meant to be shown to the Queen, that his daughter must retire. The Schwellenberg raged like a wild cat. "A scene almost horrible ensued," says Miss Burney. "She was too much enraged for disguise, and uttered the most furious expressions of indignant contempt at our proceedings. I am sure she would gladly have confined us both in the Bastile, had England such a misery, as a fit place to bring us to ourselves, from a daring so outrageous against imperial wishes." This passage deserves notice, as being the only one in the Diary, so far as we have observed, which shows Miss Burney to have been aware that she was a native of a free country, that she could not be pressed for a waiting-maid against her will, and that she had just as good a right to live, if she chose, in Saint Martin's Street, as Queen Charlotte had to live at Saint James's. The Queen promised that, after the next birthday, Miss Burney should be set at liberty. But the promise was ill kept; and her Majesty showed displeasure at being reminded of it. At length Frances was informed that in a fortnight her attendance should cease. "I heard this," she says, "with a fearful presentiment I should surely never go through another fortnight, in so weak and languishing and painful a state of health. . . . As the time of separation approached, the Queen's cordiality rather diminished, and traces of internal displeasure appeared sometimes, arising from an opinion I ought rather to have struggled on, live or die, than to quit her. Yet I am sure she saw how poor was my own chance, except by a change in the mode of life, and at least ceased to wonder, though she could not approve." Sweet Queen! What noble candour, to admit that the undutifulness of people, who did not think the honour of adjusting her tuckers worth the sacrifice of their own lives, was, though highly criminal, not altogether unnatural! We perfectly understand her Majesty's contempt for the lives of others where her own pleasure was concerned. But what pleasure she can have found in having Miss Burney about her, it is not so easy to comprehend. That Miss Burney was an eminently skilful keeper of the robes is not very probable. Few women, indeed, had paid less attention to dress. Now and then, in the course of five years, she had been asked to read aloud or to write a copy of verses. But better readers might easily have been found: and her verses were worse than even the Poet Laureate's Birthday Odes. Perhaps that economy, which was among her Majesty's most conspicuous virtues, had something to do with her conduct on this occasion. Miss Burney had never hinted that she expected a retiring pension; and indeed would gladly have given the little that she had for freedom. But her Majesty knew what the public thought, and what became her own dignity. She could not for very shame suffer a woman of distinguished genius, who had quitted a lucrative career to wait on her, who had served her faithfully for a pittance during five years, and whose constitution had been impaired by labour and watching, to leave the Courts without some mark of royal liberality. George the Third, who, on all occasions where Miss Burney was concerned, seems to have behaved like an honest, good-natured gentleman, felt this, and said plainly that she was entitled to a provision. At length, in return for all the misery which she had undergone, and for the health which she had sacrificed, an annuity of one hundred pounds was granted to her, dependent on the Queen's pleasure. Then the prison was opened, and Frances was free once more. Johnson, as Burke observed, might have added a striking page to his poem on the Vanity of Human Wishes, if he had lived to see his little Burney as she went into the palace and as she came out of it. The pleasures, so long untasted, of liberty, of friendship, of domestic affection, were almost too acute for her shattered frame. But happy days and tranquil nights soon restored the health which the Queen's toilette and Madame Schwellenberg's card-table had impaired. Kind and anxious faces surrounded the invalid. Conversation the most polished and brilliant revived her spirits. Travelling was recommended to her; and she rambled by easy journeys from cathedral to cathedral, and from watering- place to watering-place. She crossed the New Forest, and visited Stonehenge and Wilton, the cliffs of Lyme, and the beautiful valley of Sidmouth. Thence she journeyed by Powderham Castle, and by the ruins of Glastonbury Abbey to Bath, and from Bath, when the winter was approaching, returned well and cheerful to London. There she visited her old dungeon, and found her successor already far on the way to the grave, and kept to strict duty, from morning till midnight, with a sprained ankle and a nervous fever. At this time England swarmed with French exiles, driven from their country by the Revolution. A colony of these refugees settled at Juniper Hall, in Surrey, not far from Norbury Park, where Mr. Lock, an intimate friend of the Burney family, resided. Frances visited Norbury, and was introduced to the strangers. She had strong prejudices against them; for her Toryism was far beyond, we do not say that of Mr. Pitt, but that of Mr. Reeves; and the inmates of Juniper Hall were all attached to the constitution of 1791, and were therefore more detested by the royalists of the first emigration than Petion or Marat. But such a woman as Miss Burney could not long resist the fascination of that remarkable society. She had lived with Johnson and Windham, with Mrs. Montague and Mrs. Thrale. Yet she was forced to own that she had never heard conversation before. The most animated eloquence, the keenest observation, the most sparkling wit, the most courtly grace, were united to charm her. For Madame de Stael was there, and M. de Talleyrand. There too was M. de Narbonne, a noble representative of French aristocracy; and with M. de Narbonne was his friend and follower General D'Arblay, an honourable and amiable man, with a handsome person, frank soldierlike manners, and some taste for letters. The prejudices which Frances had conceived against the constitutional royalists of France rapidly vanished. She listened with rapture to Talleyrand and Madame de Stael, joined with M. D'Arblay in execrating the Jacobins and in weeping for the unhappy Bourbons, took French lessons from him, fell in love with him, and married him on no better provision than a precarious annuity of one hundred pounds. Here the Diary stops for the present. We will, therefore, bring our narrative to a speedy close, by rapidly recounting the most important events which we know to have befallen Madame D'Arblay during the latter part of her life. M. D'Arblay's fortune had perished in the general wreck of the French Revolution; and in a foreign country his talents, whatever they may have been, could scarcely make him rich. The task of providing for the family devolved on his wife. In the year 1796, she published by subscription her third novel, Camilla. It was impatiently expected by the public; and the sum which she obtained for it was, we believe, greater than had ever at that time been received for a novel. We have heard that she cleared more than three thousand guineas. But we give this merely as a rumour. Camilla, however, never attained popularity like that which Evelina and Cecilia had enjoyed; and it must be allowed that there was a perceptible falling off, not indeed in humour or in power of portraying character, but in grace and in purity of style. We have heard that, about this time, a tragedy by Madame D'Arblay was performed without success. We do not know whether it was ever printed; nor indeed have we had time to make any researches into its history or merits. During the short truce which followed the treaty of Amiens, M. D'Arblay visited France. Lauriston and La Fayette represented his claims to the French Government, and obtained a promise that he should be reinstated in his military rank. M. D'Arblay, however, insisted that he should never be required to serve against the countrymen of his wife. The First Consul, of course, would not hear of such a condition, and ordered the general's commission to be instantly revoked. Madame D'Arblay joined her husband in Paris, a short time before the war of 1803 broke out, and remained in France ten years, cut off from almost all intercourse with the land of her birth. At length, when Napoleon was on his march to Moscow, she with great difficulty obtained from his Ministers permission to visit her own country, in company with her son, who was a native of England. She returned in time to receive the last blessing of her father, who died in his eighty-seventh year. In 1814 she published her last novel, the Wanderer, a book which no judicious friend to her memory will attempt to draw from the oblivion into which it has justly fallen. In the same year her son Alexander was sent to Cambridge. He obtained an honourable place among the wranglers of his year, and was elected a fellow of Christ's College. But his reputation at the University was higher than might be inferred from his success in academical contests. His French education had not fitted him for the examinations of the Senate House; but, in pure mathematics, we have been assured by some of his competitors that he had very few equals. He went into the Church, and it was thought likely that he would attain high eminence as a preacher; but he died before his mother. All that we have heard of him leads us to believe that he was a son as such a mother deserved to have. In 1832, Madame D'Arblay published the Memoirs of her father; and on the sixth of January, 1840, she died in her eighty-eighth year. We now turn from the life of Madame D'Arblay to her writings. There can, we apprehend, be little difference of opinion as to the nature of her merit, whatever differences may exist as to its degree. She was emphatically what Johnson called her, a character-monger. It was in the exhibition of human passions and whims that her strength lay; and in this department of art she had, we think, very distinguished skill. But, in order that we may, according to our duty as kings at arms, versed in the laws of literary precedence, marshal her to the exact scat to which she is entitled, we must carry our examination somewhat further. There is, in one respect, a remarkable analogy between the faces and the minds of men. No two faces are alike; and yet very few faces deviate very widely from the common standard. Among the eighteen hundred thousand human beings who inhabit London, there is not one who could be taken by his acquaintance for another; yet we may walk from Paddington to Mile End without seeing one person in whom any feature is so overcharged that we turn round to stare at it. An infinite number of varieties lies between limits which are not very far asunder. The specimens which pass those limits on either side, form a very small minority. It is the same with the characters of men. Here, too, the variety passes all enumeration. But the cases in which the deviation from the common standing is striking and grotesque, are very few. In one mind avarice predominates; in another, pride; in a third, love of pleasure; just as in one countenance the nose is the most marked feature, while in others the chief expression lies in the brow, or in the lines of the mouth. But there are very few countenances in which nose, brow, and mouth do not contribute, though in unequal degrees, to the general effect; and so there are very few characters in which one overgrown propensity makes all others utterly insignificant. It is evident that a portrait painter, who was able only to represent faces and figures such as those which we pay money to see at fairs, would not, however spirited his execution might be, take rank among the highest artists. He must always be placed below those who have skill to seize peculiarities which do not amount to deformity. The slighter those peculiarities, the greater is the merit of the limner who can catch them and transfer them to his canvas. To paint Daniel Lambert or the living skeleton, the pig-faced lady or the Siamese twins, so that nobody can mistake them, is an exploit within the reach of a sign-painter. A third-rate artist might give us the squint of Wilkes, and the depressed nose and protuberant cheeks of Gibbon. It would require a much higher degree of skill to paint two such men as Mr. Canning and Sir Thomas Lawrence, so that nobody who had ever seen them could for a moment hesitate to assign each picture to its original. Here the mere caricaturist would be quite at fault. He would find in neither face anything on which he could lay hold for the purpose of making a distinction. Two ample bald foreheads, two regular profiles, two full faces of the same oval form, would baffle his art; and he would be reduced to the miserable shift of writing their names at the foot of his picture. Yet there was a great difference; and a person who had seen them once would no more have mistaken one of them for the other than he would have mistaken Mr. Pitt for Mr. Fox. But the difference lay in delicate lineaments and shades, reserved for pencils of a rare order. This distinction runs through all the imitative arts. Foote's mimicry was exquisitely ludicrous, but it was all caricature. He could take off only some strange peculiarity, a stammer or a lisp, a Northumbrian burr or an Irish brogue, a stoop or a shuffle. "If a man," said Johnson, "hops on one leg, Foote can hop on one leg." Garrick, on the other hand, could seize those differences of manner and pronunciation, which, though highly characteristic, are yet too slight to be described. Foote, we have no doubt, could have made the Haymarket theatre shake with laughter by imitating a conversation between a Scotchman and a Somersetshireman. But Garrick could have imitated a conversation between two fashionable men, both models of the best breeding, Lord Chesterfield, for example, and Lord Albemarle, so that no person could doubt which was which, although no person could say that, in any point, either Lord Chesterfield or Lord Albemarle spoke or moved otherwise than in conformity with the usages of the best society. The same distinction is found in the drama and in fictitious narrative. Highest among those who have exhibited human nature by means of dialogue, stands Shakspeare. His variety is like the variety of nature, endless diversity, scarcely any monstrosity. The characters of which he has given us an impression, as vivid as that which we receive from the characters of our own associates, are to be reckoned by scores. Yet in all these scores hardly one character is to be found which deviates widely from the common standard, and which we should call very eccentric if we met it in real life. The silly notion that every man has one ruling passion, and that this clue, once known, unravels all the mysteries of his conduct, finds no countenance in the plays of Shakspeare. There man appears as he is, made up of a crowd of passions, which contend for the mastery over him, and govern him in turn. What is Hamlet's ruling passion? Or Othello's? Or Harry the Fifth's? Or Wolsey's? Or Lear's? Or Shylock's? Or Benedick's? Or Macbeth's? Or that of Cassius? Or that of Falconbridge? But we might go on for ever. Take a single example, Shylock. Is he so eager for money as to be indifferent to revenge? Or so eager for revenge as to be indifferent to money? Or so bent on both together as to be indifferent to the honour of his nation and the law of Moses? All his propensities are mingled with each other, so that, in trying to apportion to each its proper part, we find the same difficulty which constantly meets us in real life. A superficial critic may say, that hatred is Shylock's ruling passion. But how many passions have amalgamated to form that hatred? It is partly the result of wounded pride: Antonio has called him dog. It is partly the result of covetousness: Antonio has hindered him of half a million; and, when Antonio is gone, there will be no limit to the gains of usury. It is partly the result of national and religious feeling: Antonio has spit on the Jewish gaberdine; and the oath of revenge has been sworn by the Jewish Sabbath. We might go through all the characters which we have mentioned, and through fifty more in the same way; for it is the constant manner of Shakspeare to represent the human mind as lying, not under the absolute dominion of one despotic propensity, but under a mixed government, in which a hundred powers balance each other. Admirable as he was in all parts of his art, we most admire him for this, that while he has left us a greater number of striking portraits than all other dramatists put together, he has scarcely left us a single caricature. Shakspeare has had neither equal nor second. But among the writers who, in the point which we have noticed, have approached nearest to the manner of the great master, we have no hesitation in placing Jane Austen, a woman of whom England is justly proud. She has given us a multitude of characters, all, in a certain sense, commonplace, all such as we meet every day. Yet they are all as perfectly discriminated from each other as if they were the most eccentric of human beings. There are, for example, four clergymen, none of whom we should be surprised to find in any parsonage in the kingdom, Mr. Edward Ferrers, Mr. Henry Tilney, Mr. Edmund Bertram, and Mr. Elton. They are all specimens of the upper part of the middle class. They have all been liberally educated. They all lie under the restraints of the same sacred profession. They are all young. They are all in love. Not one of them has any hobbyhorse, to use the phrase of Sterne. Not one has a ruling passion, such as we read of in Pope. Who would not have expected them to be insipid likenesses of each other? No such thing. Harpagun is not more unlike to Jourdain, Joseph Surface is not more unlike to Sir Lucius O'Trigger, than every one of Miss Austen's young divines to all his reverend brethren. And almost all this is done by touches so delicate, that they elude analysis, that they defy the powers of description, and that we know them to exist only by the general effect to which they have contributed. A line must be drawn, we conceive, between artists of this class, and those poets and novelists whose skill lies in the exhibiting of what Ben Jonson called humours. The words of Ben are so much to the purpose that we will quote them: "When some one peculiar quality Doth so possess a man, that it doth draw All his affects, his spirits, and his powers, In their confluxions all to run one way, This may be truly said to be a humour." There are undoubtedly persons, in whom humours such as Ben describes have attained a complete ascendency. The avarice of Elwes, the insane desire of Sir Egerton Brydges for a barony to which he had no more right than to the crown of Spain, the malevolence which long meditation on imaginary wrongs generated in the gloomy mind of Bellingham, are instances. The feeling which animated Clarkson and other virtuous men against the slave- trade and slavery, is an instance of a more honourable kind. Seeing that such humours exist, we cannot deny that they are proper subjects for the imitations of art. But we conceive that the imitation of such humours, however skilful and amusing, is not an achievement of the highest order; and, as such humours are rare in real life, they ought, we conceive, to be sparingly introduced into works which profess to be pictures of real life. Nevertheless, the writer may show so much genius in the exhibition of these humours as to be fairly entitled to a distinguished and permanent rank among classics. The chief seats of all, however, the places on the dais and under the canopy, are reserved for the few who have excelled in the difficult art of portraying characters in which no single feature is extravagantly overcharged. If we have expounded the law soundly, we can have no difficulty in applying it to the particular case before us. Madame D'Arblay has left us scarcely anything but humours. Almost every one of her men and women has some one propensity developed to a morbid degree. In Cecilia, for example, Mr. Delvile never opens his lips without some allusion to his own birth and station; or Mr. Briggs, without some allusion to the hoarding of money; or Mr. Hobson, without betraying the self-indulgence and self-importance of a purse-proud up start; or Mr. Simkins, without uttering some sneaking remark for the purpose of currying favour with his customers; or Mr. Meadows, without expressing apathy and weariness of life; or Mr. Albany, without declaiming about the vices of the rich and the misery of the poor; or Mrs. Belfield, without some indelicate eulogy on her son; or Lady Margaret, without indicating jealousy of her husband. Morrice is all skipping, officious impertinence, Mr. Gosport all sarcasm, Lady Honoria all lively prattle, Miss Larolles all silly prattle. If ever Madame D'Arblay aimed at more, we do not think that she succeeded well. We are, therefore, forced to refuse to Madame D'Arblay a place in the highest rank of art; but we cannot deny that, in the rank to which she belonged, she had few equals, and scarcely any superior. The variety of humours which is to be found in her novels is immense; and though the talk of each person separately is monotonous, the general effect is not monotony, but a very lively and agreeable diversity. Her plots are rudely constructed and improbable, if we consider them in themselves. But they are admirably framed for the purpose of exhibiting striking groups of eccentric characters, each governed by his own peculiar whim, each talking his own peculiar jargon, and each bringing out by opposition the oddities of all the rest. We will give one example out of many which occur to us. All probability is violated in order to bring Mr. Delvile, Mr. Briggs, Mr. Hobson, and Mr. Albany into a room together. But when we have them there, we soon forget probability in the exquisitely ludicrous effect which is produced by the conflict of four old fools, each raging with a monomania of his own, each talking a dialect of his own, and each inflaming all the others anew every time he opens his mouth. Madame D'Arblay was most successful in comedy, and indeed in comedy which bordered on farce. But we are inclined to infer from some passages, both in Cecilia and Camilla, that she might have attained equal distinction in the pathetic. We have formed this judgment, less from those ambitious scenes of distress which lie near the catastrophe of each of those novels, than from some exquisite strokes of natural tenderness which take us here and there by surprise. We would mention as examples, Mrs. Hill's account of her little boy's death in Cecilia, and the parting of Sir Hugh Tyrold and Camilla, when the honest baronet thinks himself dying. It is melancholy to think that the whole fame of Madame D'Arblay rests on what she did during the earlier half of her life, and that everything which she published during the forty-three years which preceded her death, lowered her reputation. Yet we have no reason to think that at the time when her faculties ought to have been in their maturity, they were smitten with any blight. In the Wanderer, we catch now and then a gleam of her genius. Even in the Memoirs of her father, there is no trace of dotage. They are very bad; but they are so, as it seems to us, not from a decay of power, but from a total perversion of power. The truth is, that Madame D'Arblay's style underwent a gradual and most pernicious change, a change which, in degree at least, we believe to be unexampled in literary history, and of which it may be useful to trace the progress. When she wrote her letters to Mr. Crisp, her early journals, and her first novel, her style was not indeed brilliant or energetic; but it was easy, clear, and free from all offensive faults. When she wrote Cecilia she aimed higher. She had then lived much in a circle of which Johnson was the centre; and she was herself one of his most submissive worshippers. It seems never to have crossed her mind that the style even of his best writings was by no means faultless, and that even had it been faultless, it might not be wise in her to imitate it. Phraseology which is proper in a disquisition on the Unities, or in a preface to a Dictionary, may be quite out of place in a tale of fashionable life. Old gentlemen do not criticise the reigning modes, nor do young gentlemen make love, with the balanced epithets and sonorous cadences which, on occasions of great dignity, a skilful writer may use with happy effect. In an evil hour the author of Evelina took the Rambler for her model. This would not have been wise even if she could have imitated her pattern as well as Hawkesworth did. But such imitation was beyond her power. She had her own style. It was a tolerably good one; and might, without any violent change, have been improved into a very good one. She determined to throw it away, and to adopt a style in which she could attain excellence only by achieving an almost miraculous victory over nature and over habit. She could cease to be Fanny Burney; it was not so easy to become Samuel Johnson. In Cecilia the change of manner began to appear. But in Cecilia the imitation of Johnson, though not always in the best taste, is sometimes eminently happy; and the passages which are so verbose as to be positively offensive, are few. There were people who whispered that Johnson had assisted his young friend, and that the novel owed all its finest passages to his hand. This was merely the fabrication of envy. Miss Burney's real excellences were as much beyond the reach of Johnson, as his real excellences were beyond her reach. He could no more have written the Masquerade scene, or the Vauxhall scene, than she could have written the Life of Cowley or the Review of Soame Jenyns. But we have not the smallest doubt that he revised Cecilia, and that he retouched the style of many passages. We know that he was in the habit of giving assistance of this kind most freely. Goldsmith, Hawkesworth, Boswell, Lord Hailes, Mrs. Williams, were among those who obtained his help. Nay, he even corrected the poetry of Mr. Crabbe, whom, we believe, he had never seen. When Miss Burney thought of writing a comedy, he promised to give her his best counsel, though he owned that he was not particularly well qualified to advise on matters relating to the stage. We therefore think it in the highest degree improbable that his little Fanny, when living in habits of the most affectionate intercourse with him, would have brought out an important work without consulting him; and, when we look into Cecilia, we see such traces of his hand in the grave and elevated passages as it is impossible to mistake. Before we conclude this article, we will give two or three examples. When next Madame D'Arblay appeared before the world as a writer, she was in a very different situation. She would not content herself with the simple English in which Evelina had been written. She had no longer the friend who, we are confident, had polished and strengthened the style of Cecilia. She had to write in Johnson's manner without Johnson's aid. The consequence was, that in Camilla every passage which she meant to be fine is detestable; and that the book has been saved from condemnation only by the admirable spirit and force of those scenes in which she was content to be familiar. But there was to be a still deeper descent. After the publication of Camilla, Madame D'Arblay resided ten years at Paris. During those years there was scarcely any intercourse between France and England. It was with difficulty that a short letter could occasionally be transmitted. All Madame D'Arblay's companions were French. She must have written, spoken, thought, in French. Ovid expressed his fear that a shorter exile might have affected the purity of his Latin. During a shorter exile, Gibbon unlearned his native English. Madame D'Arblay had carried a bad style to France. She brought back a style which we are really at a loss to describe. It is a sort of broken Johnsonese, a barbarous patois, bearing the same relation to the language of Rasselas, which the gibberish of the negroes of Jamaica bears to the English of the House of Lords. Sometimes it reminds us of the finest, that is to say, the vilest parts, of Mr. Galt's novels; sometimes of the perorations of Exeter Hall; sometimes of the leading articles of the Morning Post. But it most resembles the puffs of Mr. Rowland and Dr. Goss. It matters not what ideas are clothed in such a style. The genius of Shakspeare and Bacon united, would not save a work so written from general derision. It is only by means of specimens that we can enable our readers to judge how widely Madame D'Arblay's three styles differed from each other. The following passage was written before she became intimate with Johnson. It is from Evelina: "His son seems weaker in his understanding, and more gay in his temper; but his gaiety is that of a foolish overgrown schoolboy, whose mirth consists in noise and disturbance. He disdains his father for his close attention to business and love of money, though he seems himself to have no talents, spirit, or generosity to make him superior to either. His chief delight appears to be in tormenting and ridiculing his sisters, who in return most cordially despise him. Miss Branghton, the eldest daughter, is by no means ugly; but looks proud, ill-tempered, and conceited. She hates the city, though without knowing why; for it is easy to discover she has lived nowhere else. Miss Polly Branghton is rather pretty, very foolish, very ignorant, very giddy, and, I believe, very good-natured." This is not a fine style, but simple, perspicuous, and agreeable. We now come to Cecilia, written during Miss Burney's intimacy with Johnson; and we leave it to our readers to judge whether the following passage was not at least corrected by his hand: "It is rather an imaginary than an actual evil, and though a deep wound to pride, no offence to morality. Thus have I laid open to you my whole heart, confessed my perplexities, acknowledged my vainglory, and exposed with equal sincerity the sources of my doubts, and the motives of my decision. But now, indeed, how to proceed I know not. The difficulties which are yet to encounter I fear to enumerate, and the petition I have to urge I have scarce courage to mention. My family, mistaking ambition for honour, and rank for dignity, have long planned a splendid connection for me, to which, though my invariable repugnance has stopped any advances, their wishes and their views immoveably adhere. I am but too certain they will now listen to no other. I dread, therefore, to make a trial where I despair of success. I know not how to risk a prayer with those who may silence me by a command." Take now a specimen of Madame D'Arblay's later style. This is the way in which she tells us that her father, on his journey back from the Continent, caught the rheumatism. "He was assaulted, during his precipitated return, by the rudest fierceness of wintry elemental strife; through which, with bad accommodations and innumerable accidents, he became a prey to the merciless pangs of the acutest spasmodic rheumatism, which barely suffered him to reach his home, ere, long and piteously, it confined him, a tortured prisoner, to his bed. Such was the cheek that almost instantly curbed, though it could not subdue, the rising pleasure of his hopes of entering upon a new species of existence--that of an approved man of letters; for it was on the bed of sickness, exchanging the light wines of France, Italy, and Germany, for the black and loathsome potions of the Apothecaries' Hall, writhed by darting stitches, and burning with fiery fever, that he felt the full force of that sublunary equipoise that seems evermore to hang suspended over the attainment of long- sought and uncommon felicity, just as it is ripening to burst forth with enjoyment." Here is a second passage from Evelina: "Mrs. Selwyn is very kind and attentive to me. She is extremely clever. Her understanding, indeed, may be called masculine; but unfortunately her manners deserve the same epithet; for, in studying to acquire the knowledge of the other sex, she has lost all the softness of her own, In regard to myself, however, as I have neither courage nor inclination to argue with her, I have never been personally hurt at her want of gentleness, a virtue which nevertheless seems so essential a part of the female character, that I find myself more awkward and less at case with a woman who wants it than I do with a man." This is a good style of its kind; and the following passage from Cecilia is also in a good style, though not in a faultless one. We say with confidence, either Sam Johnson or the Devil: "Even the imperious Mr. Delvile was more supportable here than in London. Secure in his own castle, he looked round him with a pride of power and possession which softened while it swelled him. His superiority was undisputed: his will was without control. He was not, as in the great capital of the kingdom, surrounded by competitors. No rivalry disturbed his peace; no equality mortified his greatness. All he saw were either vassals of his power, or guests bending to his pleasure. He abated, therefore, considerably tile stern gloom of his haughtiness, and soothed his proud mind by the courtesy of condescension." We will stake our reputation for critical sagacity on this, that no such paragraph as that which we have last quoted, can be found in any of Madame D'Arblay's works except Cecilia. Compare with it the following sample of her later style. "If beneficence be judged by the happiness which it diffuses, whose claim, by that proof, shall stand higher than that of Mrs. Montagu, from the munificence with which she celebrated her annual festival for those hapless artificers who perform the most abject offices, of any authorised calling, in being the active guardians of our blazing hearths? Not to vainglory, then, but to kindness of heart, should be adjudged the publicity of that superb charity which made its jetty objects, for one bright morning, cease to consider themselves as degraded outcasts from all society." We add one or two shorter samples. Sheridan refused to permit his lovely wife to sing in public, and was warmly praised on this account by Johnson. "The last of men," says Madame D'Arblay, "was Doctor Johnson to have abetted squandering the delicacy of integrity by nullifying the labours of talents." The Club, Johnson's Club, did itself no honour by rejecting on political grounds two distinguished men, one a Tory, the other a Whig. Madame D'Arblay tells the story thus: "A similar ebullition of political rancour with that which so difficultly had been conquered for Mr. Canning foamed over the ballot box to the exclusion of Mr. Rogers." An offence punishable with imprisonment is, in this language, an offence "which produces incarceration." To be starved to death is "to sink from inanition into nonentity." Sir Isaac Newton is "the developer of the skies in their embodied movements"; and Mrs. Thrale, when a party of clever people sat silent, is said to have been "provoked by the dulness of a taciturnity that, in the midst of such renowned interlocutors, produced as narcotic a torpor as could have been caused by a dearth the most barren of all human faculties." In truth, it is impossible to look at any page of Madame D'Arblay's later works without finding flowers of rhetoric like these. Nothing in the language of those jargonists at whom Mr. Gosport laughed, nothing in the language of Sir Sedley Clarendel, approaches this new Euphuism. It is from no unfriendly feeling to Madame D'Arblay's memory that we have expressed ourselves so strongly on the subject of her style. On the contrary, we conceive that we have really rendered a service to her reputation. That her later works were complete failures, is a fact too notorious to be dissembled: and some persons, we believe, have consequently taken up a notion that she was from the first an overrated writer, and that she had not the powers which were necessary to maintain her on the eminence on which good luck and fashion had placed her. We believe, on the contrary, that her early popularity was no more than the just reward of distinguished merit, and would never have undergone an eclipse, if she had only been content to go on writing in her mother tongue. If she failed when she quitted her own province, and attempted to occupy one in which she had neither part nor lot, this reproach is common to her with a crowd of distinguished men. Newton failed when he turned from the courses of the stars, and the ebb and flow of the ocean, to apocalyptic seals and vials. Bentley failed when he turned from Homer and Aristophanes, to edit the Paradise Lost. Inigo failed when he attempted to rival the Gothic churches of the fourteenth century. Wilkie failed when he took it into his head that the Blind Fiddler and the Rent Day were unworthy of his powers, and challenged competition with Lawrence as a portrait painter. Such failures should be noted for the instruction of posterity; but they detract little from the permanent reputation of those who have really done great things. Yet one word more. It is not only on account of the intrinsic merit of Madame D'Arblay's early works that she is entitled to honourable mention. Her appearance is an important epoch in our literary history. Evelina was the first tale written by a woman, and purporting to be a picture of life and manners, that lived or deserved to live. The Female Quixote is no exception. That work has undoubtedly great merit, when considered as a wild satirical harlequinade; but, if we consider it as a picture of life and manners, we must pronounce it more absurd than any of the romances which it was designed to ridicule. Indeed, most of the popular novels which preceded Evelina were such as no lady would have written; and many of them were such as no lady could without confusion own that she had read. The very name of novel was held in horror among religious people. In decent families, which did not profess extraordinary sanctity, there was a strong feeling against all such works. Sir Anthony Absolute, two or three years before Evelina appeared, spoke the sense of the great body of sober fathers and husbands, when he pronounced the circulating library an evergreen tree of diabolical knowledge. This feeling on the part of the grave and reflecting, increased the evil from which it had sprung. The novelist having little character to lose, and having few readers among serious people, took without scruple liberties which in our generation seem almost incredible. Miss Burney did for the English novel what Jeremy Collier did for the English drama; and she did it in a better way. She first showed that a tale might be written in which both the fashionable and the vulgar life of London might be exhibited with great force, and with broad comic humour, and which yet should not contain a single line inconsistent with rigid morality, or even with virgin delicacy. She took away the reproach which lay on a most useful and delightful species of composition. She vindicated the right of her sex to an equal share in a fair and noble province of letters. Several accomplished women have followed in her track. At present, the novels which we owe to English ladies form no small part of the literary glory of our country. No class of works is more honourably distinguished by fine observation, by grace, by delicate wit, by pure moral feeling. Several among the successors of Madame D'Arblay have equalled her; two, we think, have surpassed her. But the fact that she has been surpassed gives her an additional claim to our respect and gratitude for, in truth, we owe to her not only Evelina, Cecilia, and Camilla, but also Mansfield Park and the Absentee. MOORE'S LIFE OF LORD BYRON (June 1831) Letters and Journals of Lord Byron; with Notices of his Life. By THOMAS MOORE, Esq. 2 vols. 4to. London: 1830. WE have read this book with the greatest pleasure. Considered merely as a composition, it deserves to be classed among the best specimens of English prose which our age has produced. It contains, indeed, no single passage equal to two or three which we could select from the Life of Sheridan. But, as a whole, it is immeasurably superior to that work. The style is agreeable, clear, and manly, and when it rises into eloquence, rises without effort or ostentation. Nor is the matter inferior to the manner. It would be difficult to name a book which exhibits more kindness, fairness, and modesty. It has evidently been written, not for the purpose of showing, what, however, it often shows, how well its author can write, but for the purpose of vindicating, as far as truth will permit, the memory of a celebrated man who can no longer vindicate himself. Mr. Moore never thrusts himself between Lord Byron and the public. With the strongest temptations to egotism, he has said no more about himself than the subject absolutely required. A great part, indeed the greater part, of these volumes, consists of extracts from the letters and journals of Lord Byron; and it is difficult to speak too highly of the skill which has been shown in the selection and arrangement. We will not say that we have not occasionally remarked in these two large quartos an anecdote which should have been omitted, a letter which should have been suppressed, a name which should have been concealed by asterisks, or asterisks which do not answer the purpose of concealing the name. But it is impossible, on a general survey, to deny that the task has been executed with great judgment and great humanity. When we consider the life which Lord Byron had led, his petulance, his irritability, and his communicativeness, we cannot but admire the dexterity with which Mr. Moore has contrived to exhibit so much of the character and opinions of his friend, with so little pain to the feelings of the living. The extracts from the journals and correspondence of Lord Byron are in the highest degree valuable, not merely on account of the information which they contain respecting the distinguished man by whom they were written, but on account also of their rare merit as compositions. The letters, at least those which were sent from Italy, are among the best in our language. They are less affected than those of Pope and Walpole; they have more matter in them than those of Cowper. Knowing that many of them were not written merely for the person to whom they were directed, but were general epistles, meant to be read by a large circle, we expected to find them clever and spirited, but deficient in ease. We looked with vigilance for instances of stiffness in the language and awkwardness in the transitions. We have been agreeably disappointed; and we must confess that, if the epistolary style of Lord Byron was artificial, it was a rare and admirable instance of that highest art which cannot be distinguished from nature. Of the deep and painful interest which this book excites no abstract can give a just notion. So sad and dark a story is scarcely to be found in any work of fiction; and we are little disposed to envy the moralist who can read it without being softened. The pretty fable by which the Duchess of Orleans illustrated the character of her son the Regent might, with little change, be applied to Byron. All the fairies, save one, had been bidden to his cradle. All the gossips had been profuse of their gifts. One had bestowed nobility, another genius, a third beauty. The malignant elf who had been uninvited came last, and, unable to reverse what her sisters had done for their favourite, had mixed up a curse with every blessing. In the rank of Lord Byron, in his understanding, in his character, in his very person, there was a strange union of opposite extremes. He was born to all that men covet and admire. But in every one of those eminent advantages which he possessed over others was mingled something of misery and debasement. He was sprung from a house, ancient indeed and noble, but degraded and impoverished by a series of crimes and follies which had attained a scandalous publicity. The kinsman whom he succeeded had died poor, and, but for merciful judges, would have died upon the gallows. The young peer had great intellectual powers; yet there was an unsound part in his mind. He had naturally a generous and feeling heart: but his temper was wayward and irritable. He had a head which statuaries loved to copy, and a foot the deformity of which the beggars in the streets mimicked. Distinguished at once by the strength and by the weakness of his intellect, affectionate yet perverse, a poor lord, and a handsome cripple, he required, if ever man required, the firmest and the most judicious training. But, capriciously as nature had dealt with him, the parent to whom the office of forming his character was intrusted was more capricious still. She passed from paroxysms of rage to paroxysms of tenderness. At one time she stifled him with her caresses; at another time she insulted his deformity. He came into the world; and the world treated him as his mother had treated him, sometimes with fondness, sometimes with cruelty, never with justice. It indulged him without discrimination, and punished him without discrimination. He was truly a spoiled child, not merely the spoiled child of his parent, but the spoiled child of nature, the spoiled child of fortune, the spoiled child of fame, the spoiled child of society. His first poems were received with a contempt which, feeble as they were, they did not absolutely deserve. The poem which he published on his return from his travels was, on the other hand, extolled far above its merit. At twenty-four, he found himself on the highest pinnacle of literary fame, with Scott, Wordsworth, Southey, and a crowd of other distinguished writers beneath his feet. There is scarcely an instance in history of so sudden a rise to so dizzy an eminence. Everything that could stimulate, and everything that could gratify the strongest propensities of our nature, the gaze of a hundred drawing-rooms, the acclamations of the whole nation, the applause of applauded men, the love of lovely women, all this world and all the glory of it were at once offered to a youth to whom nature had given violent passions, and whom education had never taught to control them. He lived as many men live who have no similar excuse to plead for their faults. But his countrymen and his countrywomen would love him and admire him. They were resolved to see in his excesses only the flash and outbreak of that same fiery mind which glowed in his poetry. He attacked religion; yet in religious circles his name was mentioned with fondness, and in many religious publications his works were censured with singular tenderness. He lampooned the Prince Regent; yet he could not alienate the Tories. Everything, it seemed, was to be forgiven to youth, rank, and genius. Then came the reaction. Society, capricious in its indignation as it had been capricious in its fondness, flew into a rage with its froward and petted darling. He had been worshipped with an irrational idolatry. He was persecuted with an irrational fury. Much has been written about those unhappy domestic occurrences which decided the fate of his life. Yet nothing is, nothing ever was, positively known to the public, but this, that he quarrelled with his lady, and that she refused to live with him. There have been hints in abundance, and shrugs and shakings of the head, and "Well, well, we know," and "We could an if we would," and "If we list to speak," and "There be that might an they list." But we are not aware that there is before the world substantiated by credible, or even by tangible evidence, a single fact indicating that Lord Byron was more to blame than any other man who is on bad terms with his wife. The professional men whom Lady Byron consulted were undoubtedly of opinion that she ought not to live with her husband. But it is to be remembered that they formed that opinion without hearing both sides. We do not say, we do not mean to insinuate, that Lady Byron was in any respect to blame. We think that those who condemn her on the evidence which is now before the public are as rash as those who condemn her husband. We will not pronounce any judgment, we cannot, even in our own minds, form any judgment, on a transaction which is so imperfectly known to us. It would have been well if, at the time of the separation, all those who knew as little about the matter then as we know about it now, had shown that forbearance which, under such circumstances, is but common justice. We know no spectacle so ridiculous as the British public in one of its periodical fits of morality. In general, elopements, divorces, and family quarrels, pass with little notice. We read the scandal, talk about it for a day, and forget it. But once in six or seven years our virtue becomes outrageous. We cannot suffer the laws of religion and decency to be violated. We must make a stand against vice. We must teach libertines that the English people appreciate the importance of domestic ties. Accordingly some unfortunate man, in no respect more depraved than hundreds whose offences have been treated with lenity, is singled out as an expiatory sacrifice. If he has children, they are to be taken from him. If he has a profession, he is to be driven from it. He is cut by the higher orders, and hissed by the lower. He is, in truth, a sort of whipping-boy, by whose vicarious agonies all the other transgressors of the same class are, it is supposed, sufficiently chastised. We reflect very complacently on our own severity, and compare with great pride the high standard of morals established in England with the Parisian laxity. At length our anger is satiated. Our victim is ruined and heart-broken. And our virtue goes quietly to sleep for seven years more. It is clear that those vices which destroy domestic happiness ought to be as much as possible repressed. It is equally clear that they cannot be repressed by penal legislation. It is therefore right and desirable that public opinion should be directed against them. But it should be directed against them uniformly, steadily, and temperately, not by sudden fits and starts. There should be one weight and one measure. Decimation is always an objectionable mode of punishment. It is the resource of judges too indolent and hasty to investigate facts and to discriminate nicely between shades of guilt. It is an irrational practice, even when adopted by military tribunals. When adopted by the tribunal of public opinion, it is infinitely more irrational. It is good that a certain portion of disgrace should constantly attend on certain bad actions. But it is not good that the offenders should merely have to stand the risks of a lottery of infamy, that ninety-nine out of every hundred should escape, and that the hundredth, perhaps the most innocent of the hundred, should pay for all. We remember to have seen a mob assembled in Lincoln's Inn to hoot a gentleman against whom the most oppressive proceeding known to the English law was then in progress. He was hooted because he had been an unfaithful husband, as if some of the most popular men of the age, Lord Nelson for example, had not been unfaithful husbands. We remember a still stronger case. Will posterity believe that, in an age in which men whose gallantries were universally known, and had been legally proved, filled some of the highest offices in the State and in the army, presided at the meetings of religions and benevolent institutions, were the delight of every society, and the favourites of the multitude, a crowd of moralists went to the theatre, in order to pelt a poor actor for disturbing the conjugal felicity of an alderman? What there was in the circumstances either of the offender or of the sufferer to vindicate the zeal of the audience, we could never conceive. It has never been supposed that the situation of an actor is peculiarly favourable to the rigid virtues, or that an alderman enjoys any special immunity from injuries such as that which on this occasion roused the anger of the public. But such is the justice of mankind. In these cases the punishment was excessive; but the offence was known and proved. The case of Lord Byron was harder. True Jedwood justice was dealt out to him. First came the execution, then the investigation, and last of all, or rather not at all, the accusation. The public, without knowing anything whatever about the transactions in his family, flew into a violent passion with him, and proceeded to invent stories which might justify its anger. Ten or twenty different accounts of the separation, inconsistent with each other, with themselves, and with common sense, circulated at the same time. What evidence there might be for any one of these, the virtuous people who repeated them neither knew nor cared. For in fact these stories were not the causes, but the effects of the public indignation. They resembled those loathsome slanders which Lewis Goldsmith, and other abject libellers of the same class, were in the habit of publishing about Bonaparte; such as that he poisoned a girl with arsenic when he was at the military school, that he hired a grenadier to shoot Dessaix at Marengo, that he filled St. Cloud with all the pollutions of Capreae. There was a time when anecdotes like these obtained some credence from persons who, hating the French emperor without knowing why, were eager to believe anything which might justify their hatred. Lord Byron fared in the same way. His countrymen were in a bad humour with him. His writings and his character had lost the charm of novelty. He had been guilty of the offence which, of all offences, is punished most severely; he had been over-praised; he had excited too warm an interest; and the public, with its usual justice, chastised him for its own folly. The attachments of the multitude bear no small resemblance to those of the wanton enchantress in the Arabian Tales, who, when the forty days of her fondness were over, was not content with dismissing her lovers, but condemned them to expiate, in loathsome shapes, and under cruel penances, the crime of having once pleased her too well. The obloquy which Byron had to endure was such as might well have shaken a more constant mind. The newspapers were filled with lampoons. The theatres shook with execrations. He was excluded from circles where he had lately been the observed of all observers. All those creeping things that riot in the decay of nobler natures hastened to their repast; and they were right; they did after their kind. It is not every day that the savage envy of aspiring dunces is gratified by the agonies of such a spirit, and the degradation of such a name. The unhappy man left his country for ever. The howl of contumely followed him across the sea, up the Rhine, over the Alps; it gradually waxed fainter; it died away; those who had raised it began to ask each other, what, after all, was the matter about which they had been so clamorous, and wished to invite back the criminal whom they had just chased from them. His poetry became more popular than it had ever been; and his complaints were read with tears by thousands and tens of thousands who had never seen his face. He had fixed his home on the shores of the Adriatic, in the most picturesque and interesting of cities, beneath the brightest of skies, and by the brightest of seas. Censoriousness was not the vice of the neighbours whom he had chosen. They were a race corrupted by a bad government and a bad religion, long renowned for skill in the arts of voluptuousness, and tolerant of all the caprices of sensuality. From the public opinion of the country of his adoption, he had nothing to dread. With the public opinion of the country of his birth, he was at open war. He plunged into wild and desperate excesses, ennobled by no generous or tender sentiment. From his Venetian haram, he sent forth volume after volume, full of eloquence, of wit, of pathos, of ribaldry, and of bitter disdain. His health sank under the effects of his intemperance. His hair turned grey. His food ceased to nourish him. A hectic fever withered him up. It seemed that his body and mind were about to perish together. From this wretched degradation he was in some measure rescued by a connection, culpable indeed, yet such as, if it were judged by the standard of morality established in the country where he lived, might be called virtuous. But an imagination polluted by vice, a temper embittered by misfortune, and a frame habituated to the fatal excitement of intoxication, prevented him from fully enjoying the happiness which he might have derived from the purest and most tranquil of his many attachments. Midnight draughts of ardent spirits and Rhenish wines had begun to work the ruin of his fine intellect. His verse lost much of the energy and condensation which had distinguished it. But he would not resign, without a struggle, the empire which he had exercised over the men of his generation. A new dream of ambition arose before him; to be the chief of a literary party; to be the great mover of an intellectual revolution; to guide the public mind of England from his Italian retreat, as Voltaire had guided the public mind of France from the villa of Ferney. With this hope, as it should seem, he established The Liberal. But, powerfully as he had affected the imaginations of his contemporaries, he mistook his own powers if he hoped to direct their opinions; and he still more grossly mistook his own disposition, if he thought that he could long act in concert with other men of letters. The plan failed, and failed ignominiously. Angry with himself, angry with his coadjutors, he relinquished it, and turned to another project, the last and noblest of his life. A nation, once the first among the nations, pre-eminent in knowledge, pre-eminent in military glory, the cradle of philosophy, of eloquence, and of the fine arts, had been for ages bowed down under a cruel yoke. All the vices which oppression generates, the abject vices which it generates in those who submit to it, the ferocious vices which it generates in those who struggle against it, had deformed the character of that miserable race. The valour which had won the great battle of human civilisation, which had saved Europe, which had subjugated Asia, lingered only among pirates and robbers. The ingenuity, once so conspicuously displayed in every department of physical and moral science, had been depraved into a timid and servile cunning. On a sudden this degraded people had risen on their oppressors. Discountenanced or betrayed by the surrounding potentates, they had found in themselves something of that which might well supply the place of all foreign assistance, something of the energy of their fathers. As a man of letters, Lord Byron could not but be interested in the event of this contest. His political opinions, though, like all his opinions, unsettled, leaned strongly towards the side of liberty. He had assisted the Italian insurgents with his purse, and, if their struggle against the Austrian Government had been prolonged, would probably have assisted them with his sword. But to Greece he was attached by peculiar ties. He had when young resided in that country. Much of his most splendid and popular poetry had been inspired by its scenery and by its history. Sick of inaction, degraded in his own eyes by his private vices and by his literary failures, pining for untried excitement and honourable distinction, he carried his exhausted body and his wounded spirit to the Grecian camp. His conduct in his new situation showed so much vigour and good sense as to justify us in believing that, if his life had been prolonged, he might have distinguished himself as a soldier and a politician. But pleasure and sorrow had done the work of seventy years upon his delicate frame. The hand of death was upon him: he knew it; and the only wish which he uttered was that he might die sword in hand. This was denied to him. Anxiety, exertion, exposure, and those fatal stimulants which had become indispensable to him, soon stretched him on a sick-bed, in a strange land, amidst strange faces, without one human being that he loved near him. There, at thirty-six, the most celebrated Englishman of the nineteenth century closed his brilliant and miserable career. We cannot even now retrace those events without feeling something of what was felt by the nation, when it was first known that the grave had closed over so much sorrow and so much glory; something of what was felt by those who saw the hearse, with its long train of coaches, turn slowly northward, leaving behind it that cemetery which had been consecrated by the dust of so many great poets, but of which the doors were closed against all that remained of Byron. We well remember that on that day, rigid moralists could not refrain from weeping for one so young, so illustrious, so unhappy, gifted with such rare gifts, and tried by such strong temptations. It is unnecessary to make any reflections. The history carries its moral with it. Our age has indeed been fruitful of warnings to the eminent and of consolations to the obscure. Two men have died within our recollection, who, at the time of life at which many people have hardly completed their education, had raised themselves, each in his own department, to the height of glory. One of them died at Longwood; the other at Missolonghi. It is always difficult to separate the literary character of a man who lives in our own time from his personal character. It is peculiarly difficult to make this separation in the case of Lord Byron. For it is scarcely too much to say, that Lord Byron never wrote without some reference, direct or indirect, to himself The interest excited by the events of his life mingles itself in our minds, and probably in the minds of almost all our readers, with the interest which properly belongs to his works. A generation must pass away before it will be possible to form a fair judgment of his books, considered merely as books. At present they are not only books but relics. We will however venture, though with unfeigned diffidence, to offer some desultory remarks on his poetry. His lot was cast in the time of a great literary revolution. That poetical dynasty which had dethroned the successors of Shakspeare and Spenser was, in its turn, dethroned by a race who represented themselves as heirs of the ancient line, so long dispossessed by usurpers. The real nature of this revolution has not, we think, been comprehended by the great majority of those who concurred in it. Wherein especially does the poetry of our times differ from that of the last century? Ninety-nine persons out of a hundred would answer that the poetry of the last century was correct, but cold and mechanical, and that the poetry of our time, though wild and irregular, presented far more vivid images, and excited the passions far more strongly than that of Parnell, of Addison, or of Pope. In the same manner we constantly hear it said, that the poets of the age of Elizabeth had far more genius, but far less correctness, than those of the age of Anne. It seems to be taken for granted, that there is some incompatibility, some antithesis between correctness and creative power. We rather suspect that this notion arises merely from an abuse of words, and that it has been the parent of many of the fallacies which perplex the science of criticism. What is meant by correctness in poetry? If by correctness he meant the conforming to rules which have their foundation in truth and in the principles of human nature, then correctness is only another name for excellence. If by correctness be meant the conforming to rules purely arbitrary, correctness may be another name for dulness and absurdity. A writer who describes visible objects falsely and violates the propriety of character, a writer who makes the mountains "nod their drowsy heads" at night, or a dying man take leave of the world with a rant like that of Maximin, may be said, in the high and just sense of the phrase, to write incorrectly. He violates the first great law of his art. His imitation is altogether unlike the thing imitated. The four poets who are most eminently free from incorrectness of this description are Homer, Dante, Shakspeare, and Milton. They are, therefore, in one sense, and that the best sense, the most correct of poets. When it is said that Virgil, though he had less genius than Homer, was a more correct writer, what sense is attached to the word correctness? Is it meant that the story of the Aeneid is developed more skilfully than that of the Odyssey? that the Roman describes the face of the external world, or the emotions of the mind, more accurately than the Greek? that the characters of Achates and Mnestheus are more nicely discriminated, and more consistently supported, than those of Achilles, of Nestor, and of Ulysses? The fact incontestably is that, for every violation of the fundamental laws of poetry which can be found in Homer, it would be easy to find twenty in Virgil. Troilus and Cressida is perhaps of all the plays of Shakspeare that which is commonly considered as the most incorrect. Yet it seems to us infinitely more correct, in the sound sense of the term, than what are called the most correct plays of the most correct dramatists. Compare it, for example, with the Iphigenie of Racine. We are sure that the Greeks of Shakspeare bear a far greater resemblance than the Greeks of Racine to the real Greeks who besieged Troy; and for this reason, that the Greeks of Shakspeare are human beings, and the Greeks of Racine mere names, mere words printed in capitals at the head of paragraphs of declamation. Racine, it is true, would have shuddered at the thought of making a warrior at the siege of Troy quote Aristotle. But of what use is it to avoid a single anachronism, when the whole play is one anachronism, the sentiments and phrases of Versailles in the camp of Aulis? In the sense in which we are now using the word correctness, we think that Sir Walter Scott, Mr. Wordsworth, Mr. Coleridge, are far more correct poets than those who are commonly extolled as the models of correctness, Pope, for example, and Addison. The single description of a moonlight night in Pope's Iliad contains more inaccuracies than can be found in all the Excursion. There is not a single scene in Cato, in which all that conduces to poetical illusion, all the propriety of character, of language, of situation, is not more grossly violated than in any part of the Lay of the Last Minstrel. No man can possibly think that the Romans of Addison resemble the real Romans so closely as the moss-troopers of Scott resemble the real moss-troopers. Wat Tinlinn and William of Deloraine are not, it is true, persons of so much dignity as Cato. But the dignity of the persons represented has as little to do with the correctness of poetry as with the correctness of painting. We prefer a gipsy by Reynolds to his Majesty's head on a signpost, and a Borderer by Scott to a Senator by Addison. In what sense, then, is the word correctness used by those who say, with the author of the Pursuits of Literature, that Pope was the most correct of English Poets, and that next to Pope came the late Mr. Gifford? What is the nature and value of that correctness, the praise of which is denied to Macbeth, to Lear, and to Othello, and given to Hoole's translations and to all the Seatonian prize-poems? We can discover no eternal rule, no rule founded in reason and in the nature of things, which Shakspeare does not observe much more strictly than Pope. But if by correctness be meant the conforming to a narrow legislation which, while lenient to the mala in se, multiplies, without a shadow of a reason, the mala prohibita, if by correctness be meant a strict attention to certain ceremonious observances, which are no more essential to poetry than etiquette to good government, or than the washings of a Pharisee to devotion, then, assuredly, Pope may be a more correct poet than Shakspeare; and, if the code were a little altered, Colley Cibber might be a more correct poet than Pope. But it may well be doubted whether this kind of correctness be a merit, nay, whether it be not an absolute fault. It would be amusing to make a digest of the irrational laws which bad critics have framed for the government of poets. First in celebrity and in absurdity stand the dramatic unities of place and time. No human being has ever been able to find anything that could, even by courtesy, be called an argument for these unities, except that they have been deduced from the general practice of the Greeks. It requires no very profound examination to discover that the Greek dramas, often admirable as compositions, are, as exhibitions of human character and human life, far inferior to the English plays of the age of Elizabeth. Every scholar knows that the dramatic part of the Athenian tragedies was at first subordinate to the lyrical part. It would, therefore, have been little less than a miracle if the laws of the Athenian stage had been found to suit plays in which there was no chorus. All the greatest masterpieces of the dramatic art have been composed in direct violation of the unities, and could never have been composed if the unities had not been violated. It is clear, for example, that such a character as that of Hamlet could never have been developed within the limits to which Alfieri confined himself. Yet such was the reverence of literary men during the last century for these unities that Johnson who, much to his honour, took the opposite side, was, as he says, "frightened at his own temerity," and "afraid to stand against the authorities which might be produced against him." There are other rules of the same kind without end. "Shakspeare," says Rymer, "ought not to have made Othello black; for the hero of a tragedy ought always to be white." "Milton," says another critic, "ought not to have taken Adam for his hero; for the hero of an epic poem ought always to be victorious." "Milton," says another, "ought not to have put so many similes into his first book; for the first book of an epic poem ought always to be the most unadorned. There are no similes in the first book of the Iliad." "Milton," says another, "ought not to have placed in an epic poem such lines as these: 'While thus I called, and strayed I knew not whither.'" And why not? The critic is ready with a reason, a lady's reason. "Such lines," says he, "are not, it must be allowed, unpleasing to the ear; but the redundant syllable ought to be confined to the drama, and not admitted into epic poetry." As to the redundant syllable in heroic rhyme on serious subjects, it has been, from the time of Pope downward, proscribed by the general consent of all the correct school. No magazine would have admitted so incorrect a couplet as that of Drayton. "As when we lived untouch'd with these disgraces, When as our kingdom was our dear embraces." Another law of heroic rhyme, which, fifty years ago, was considered as fundamental, was, that there should be a pause, a comma at least, at the end of every couplet. It was also provided that there should never be a full stop except at the end of a line. Well do we remember to have heard a most correct judge of poetry revile Mr. Rogers for the incorrectness of that most sweet and graceful passage, "Such grief was ours,--it seems but yesterday,-- When in thy prime, wishing so much to stay, 'Twas thine, Maria, thine without a sigh At midnight in a sister's arms to die. Oh thou wert lovely; lovely was thy frame, And pure thy spirit as from heaven it came: And when recall'd to join the blest above Thou diedst a victim to exceeding love, Nursing the young to health. In happier hours, When idle Fancy wove luxuriant flowers, Once in thy mirth thou badst me write on thee And now I write what thou shalt never see." Sir Roger Newdigate is fairly entitled, we think, to be ranked among the great critics of this school. He made a law that none of the poems written for the prize which he established at Oxford should exceed fifty lines. This law seems to us to have at least as much foundation in reason as any of those which we have mentioned; nay, much more, for the world, we believe, is pretty well agreed in thinking that the shorter a prize-poem is, the better. We do not see why we should not make a few more rules of the same kind; why we should not enact that the number of scenes in every act shall be three or some multiple of three, that the number of lines in every scene shall be an exact square, that the dramatis personae shall never be more or fewer than sixteen, and that, in heroic rhymes, every thirty-sixth line shall have twelve syllables. If we were to lay down these canons, and to call Pope, Goldsmith, and Addison incorrect writers for not having complied with our whims, we should act precisely as those critics act who find incorrectness in the magnificent imagery and the varied music of Coleridge and Shelley. The correctness which the last century prized so much resembles the correctness of those pictures of the garden of Eden which we see in old Bibles. We have an exact square enclosed by the rivers Pison, Gihon, Hiddekel, and Euphrates, each with a convenient bridge in the centre, rectangular beds of flowers, a long canal, neatly bricked and railed in, the tree of knowledge clipped like one of the limes behind the Tuilleries, standing in the centre of the grand alley, the snake twined round it, the man on the right hand, the woman on the left, and the beasts drawn up in an exact circle round them. In one sense the picture is correct enough. That is to say, the squares are correct; the circles are correct; the man and the woman are in a most correct line with the tree; and the snake forms a most correct spiral. But if there were a painter so gifted that he could place on the canvas that glorious paradise, seen by the interior eye of him whose outward sight had failed with long watching and labouring for liberty and truth, if there were a painter who could set before us the mazes of the sapphire brook, the lake with its fringe of myrtles, the flowery meadows, the grottoes overhung by vines, the forests shining with Hesperian fruit and with the plumage of gorgeous birds, the massy shade of that nuptial bower which showered down roses on the sleeping lovers, what should we think of a connoisseur, who should tell us that this painting, though finer than the absurd picture in the old Bible, was not so correct. Surely we should answer, it is both finer and more correct; and it is finer because it is more correct. It is not made up of correctly drawn diagrams; but it is a correct painting, a worthy representation of that which it is intended to represent. It is not in the fine arts alone that this false correctness is prized by narrow-minded men, by men who cannot distinguish means from ends, or what is accidental from what is essential. M. Jourdain admired correctness in fencing. "You had no business to hit me then. You must never thrust in quart till you have thrust in tierce." M. Tomes liked correctness in medical practice. "I stand up for Artemius. That he killed his patient is plain enough. But still he acted quite according to rule. A man dead is a man dead; and there is an end of the matter. But if rules are to be broken, there is no saying what consequences may follow." We have heard of an old German officer, who was a great admirer of correctness in military operations. He used to revile Bonaparte for spoiling the science of war, which had been carried to such exquisite perfection by Marshal Daun. "In my youth we used to march and countermarch all the summer without gaining or losing a square league, and then we went into winter quarters. And now comes an ignorant, hot-headed young man, who flies about from Boulogne to Ulm, and from Ulm to the middle of Moravia, and fights battles in December. The whole system of his tactics is monstrously incorrect." The world is of opinion in spite of critics like these, that the end of fencing is to hit, that the end of medicine is to cure, that the end of war is to conquer, and that those means are the most correct which best accomplish the ends. And has poetry no end, no eternal and immutable principles? Is poetry, like heraldry, mere matter of arbitrary regulation? The heralds tell us that certain scutcheons and bearings denote certain conditions, and that to put colours on colours, or metals on metals, is false blazonry. If all this were reversed, if every coat of arms in Europe were new fashioned, if it were decreed that or should never be placed but on argent, or argent but on or, that illegitimacy should be denoted by a lozenge, and widowhood by a bend, the new science would be just as good as the old science, because both the new and the old would be good for nothing. The mummery of Portcullis and Rouge Dragon, as it has no other value than that which caprice has assigned to it, may well submit to any laws which caprice may impose on it. But it is not so with that great imitative art, to the power of which all ages, the rudest and the most enlightened, bear witness. Since its first great masterpieces were produced, everything that is changeable in this world has been changed. Civilisation has been gained, lost, gained again. Religions, and languages, and forms of government, and usages of private life, and modes of thinking, all have undergone a succession of revolutions. Everything has passed away but the great features of nature, and the heart of man, and the miracles of that art of which it is the office to reflect back the heart of man and the features of nature. Those two strange old poems, the wonder of ninety generations, still retain all their freshness. They still command the veneration of minds enriched by the literature of many nations and ages. They are still, even in wretched translations, the delight of school- boys. Having survived ten thousand capricious fashions, having seen successive codes of criticism become obsolete, they still remain to us, immortal with the immortality of truth, the same when perused in the study of an English scholar, as when they were first chanted at the banquets of the Ionian princes. Poetry is, as was said more than two thousand years ago, imitation. It is an art analogous in many respects to the art of painting, sculpture, and acting. The imitations of the painter, the sculptor, and the actor, are indeed, within certain limits, more perfect than those of the poet. The machinery which the poet employs consists merely of words; and words cannot, even when employed by such an artist as Homer or Dante, present to the mind images of visible objects quite so lively and exact as those which we carry away from looking on the works of the brush and the chisel. But, on the other hand, the range of poetry is infinitely wider than that of any other imitative art, or than that of all the other imitative arts together. The sculptor can imitate only form; the painter only form and colour; the actor, until the poet supplies him with words, only form, colour, and motion. Poetry holds the outer world in common with the other arts. The heart of man is the province of poetry, and of poetry alone. The painter, the sculptor, and the actor can exhibit no more of human passion and character than that small portion which overflows into the gesture and the face, always an imperfect, often a deceitful, sign of that which is within. The deeper and more complex parts of human nature can be exhibited by means of words alone. Thus the objects of the imitation of poetry are the whole external and the whole internal universe, the face of nature, the vicissitudes of fortune, man as he is in himself, man as he appears in society, all things which really exist, all things of which we can form an image in our minds by combining together parts of things which really exist. The domain of this imperial art is commensurate with the imaginative faculty. An art essentially imitative ought not surely to be subjected to rules which tend to make its imitations less perfect than they otherwise would be; and those who obey such rules ought to be called, not correct, but incorrect artists. The true way to judge of the rules by which English poetry was governed during the last century is to look at the effects which they produced. It was in 1780 that Johnson completed his Lives of the Poets. He tells us in that work that, since the time of Dryden, English poetry had shown no tendency to relapse into its original savageness, that its language had been refined, its numbers tuned, and its sentiments improved. It may perhaps be doubted whether the nation had any great reason to exult in the refinements and improvements which gave it Douglas for Othello, and the Triumphs of Temper for the Fairy Queen. It was during the thirty years which preceded the appearance of Johnson's Lives that the diction and versification of English poetry were, in the sense in which the word is commonly used, most correct. Those thirty years are, as respects poetry, the most deplorable part of our literary history. They have indeed bequeathed to us scarcely any poetry which deserves to be remembered. Two or three hundred lines of Gray, twice as many of Goldsmith, a few stanzas of Beattie and Collins, a few strophes of Mason, and a few clever prologues and satires, were the masterpieces of this age of consummate excellence. They may all be printed in one volume, and that volume would be by no means a volume of extraordinary merit. It would contain no poetry of the very highest class, and little which could be placed very high in the second class. The Paradise Regained or Comus would outweigh it all. At last, when poetry had fallen into such utter decay that Mr. Hayley was thought a great poet, it began to appear that the excess of the evil was about to work the cure. Men became tired of an insipid conformity to a standard which derived no authority from nature or reason. A shallow criticism had taught them to ascribe a superstitious value to the spurious correctness of poetasters. A deeper criticism brought them back to the true correctness of the first great masters. The eternal laws of poetry regained their power, and the temporary fashions which had superseded those laws went after the wig of Lovelace and the hoop of Clarissa. It was in a cold and barren season that the seeds of that rich harvest which we have reaped were first sown. While poetry was every year becoming more feeble and more mechanical, while the monotonous versification which Pope had introduced, no longer redeemed by his brilliant wit and his compactness of expression, palled on the ear of the public, the great works of the old masters were every day attracting more and more of the admiration which they deserved. The plays of Shakspeare were better acted, better edited, and better known than they had ever been. Our fine ancient ballads were again read with pleasure, and it became a fashion to imitate them. Many of the imitations were altogether contemptible. But they showed that men had at least begun to admire the excellence which they could not rival. A literary revolution was evidently at hand. There was a ferment in the minds of men, a vague craving for something new, a disposition to hail with delight anything which might at first sight wear the appearance of originality. A reforming age is always fertile of impostors. The same excited state of public feeling which produced the great separation from the see of Rome produced also the excesses of the Anabaptists. The same stir in the public mind of Europe which overthrew the abuses of the old French Government, produced the Jacobins and Theophilanthropists. Macpherson and Della Crusca were to the true reformers of English poetry what Knipperdoling was to Luther, or Clootz to Turgot. The success of Chatterton's forgeries and of the far more contemptible forgeries of Ireland showed that people had begun to love the old poetry well, though not wisely. The public was never more disposed to believe stories without evidence, and to admire books without merit. Anything which could break the dull monotony of the correct school was acceptable. The forerunner of the great restoration of our literature was Cowper. His literary career began and ended at nearly the same time with that of Alfieri. A comparison between Alfieri and Cowper may, at first sight, appear as strange as that which a loyal Presbyterian minister is said to have made in 1745 between George the Second and Enoch. It may seem that the gentle, shy, melancholy Calvinist, whose spirit had been broken by fagging at school, who had not courage to earn a livelihood by reading the titles of bills in the House of Lords, and whose favourite associates were a blind old lady and an evangelical divine, could have nothing in common with the haughty, ardent, and voluptuous nobleman, the horse-jockey, the libertine, who fought Lord Ligonier in Hyde Park, and robbed the Pretender of his queen. But though the private lives of these remarkable men present scarcely any points of resemblance, their literary lives bear a close analogy to each other. They both found poetry in its lowest state of degradation, feeble, artificial, and altogether nerveless. They both possessed precisely the talents which fitted them for the task of raising it from that deep abasement. They cannot, in strictness, be called great poets. They had not in any very high degree the creative power, "The vision and the faculty divine": but they had great vigour of thought, great warmth of feeling, and what, in their circumstances, was above all things important, a manliness of taste which approached to roughness. They did not deal in mechanical versification and conventional phrases. They wrote concerning things the thought of which set their hearts on fire; and thus what they wrote, even when it wanted every other grace, had that inimitable grace which sincerity and strong passion impart to the rudest and most homely compositions. Each of them sought for inspiration in a noble and affecting subject, fertile of images which had not yet been hackneyed. Liberty was the muse of Alfieri, Religion was the muse of Cowper. The same truth is found in their lighter pieces. They were not among those who deprecated the severity, or deplored the absence, of an unreal mistress in melodious commonplaces. Instead of raving about imaginary Chloes and Sylvias, Cowper wrote of Mrs. Unwin's knitting-needles. The only love-verses of Alfieri were addressed to one whom he truly and passionately loved. "Tutte le rime amorose che seguono," says he, "tutte sono per essa, e ben sue, e di lei solamente; poiche mai d'altra donna per certo con cantero." These great men were not free from affectation. But their affectation was directly opposed to the affectation which generally prevailed. Each of them expressed, in strong and bitter language, the contempt which he felt for the effeminate poetasters who were in fashion both in England and in Italy. Cowper complains that "Manner is all in all, whate'er is writ, The substitute for genius, taste, and wit." He praised Pope; yet he regretted that Pope had "Made poetry a mere mechanic art, And every warbler had his tune by heart." Alfieri speaks with similar scorn of the tragedies of his predecessors. "Mi cadevano dalle mani per la languidezza, trivialita e prolissita dei modi e dei verso, senza parlare poi della snervatezza dei pensieri. Or perche mai questa nostra divina lingua, si maschia anco, ed energica, e feroce, in bocca di Dante, dovra ella farsi casi sbiadata ed eunuca nel dialogo tragico?" To men thus sick of the languid manner of their contemporaries ruggedness seemed a venial fault, or rather a positive merit. In their hatred of meretricious ornament, and of what Cowper calls "creamy smoothness," they erred on the opposite side. Their style was too austere, their versification too harsh. It is not easy, however, to overrate the service which they rendered to literature. The intrinsic value of their poems is considerable. But the example which they set of mutiny against an absurd system was invaluable. The part which they performed was rather that of Moses than that of Joshua. They opened the house of bondage; but they did not enter the promised land. During the twenty years which followed the death of Cowper, the revolution in English poetry was fully consummated. None of the writers of this period, not even Sir Walter Scott, contributed so much to the consummation as Lord Byron. Yet Lord Byron contributed to it unwillingly, and with constant self-reproach and shame. All his tastes and inclinations led him to take part with the school of poetry which was going out against the school which was coming in. Of Pope himself he spoke with extravagant admiration. He did not venture directly to say that the little man of Twickenham was a greater poet than Shakspeare or Milton; but he hinted pretty clearly that he thought so. Of his contemporaries, scarcely any had so much of his admiration as Mr. Gifford, who, considered as a poet, was merely Pope, without Pope's wit and fancy, and whose satires are decidedly inferior in vigour and poignancy to the very imperfect juvenile performance of Lord Byron himself. He now and then praised Mr. Wordsworth and Mr. Coleridge, but ungraciously and without cordiality. When he attacked them, he brought his whole soul to the work. Of the most elaborate of Mr. Wordsworth's poems he could find nothing to say, but that it was "clumsy, and frowsy, and his aversion." Peter Bell excited his spleen to such a degree that he evoked the shades of Pope and Dryden, and demanded of them whether it were possible that such trash could evade contempt? In his heart he thought his own Pilgrimage of Harold inferior to his Imitation of Horace's Art of Poetry, a feeble echo of Pope and Johnson. This insipid performance he repeatedly designed to publish, and was withheld only by the solicitations of his friends. He has distinctly declared his approbation of the unities, the most absurd laws by which genius was ever held in servitude. In one of his works, we think in his letter to Mr. Bowles, he compares the poetry of the eighteenth century to the Parthenon, and that of the nineteenth to a Turkish mosque, and boasts that, though he had assisted his contemporaries in building their grotesque and barbarous edifice, he had never joined them in defacing the remains of a chaster and more graceful architecture. In another letter he compares the change which had recently passed on English poetry to the decay of Latin poetry after the Augustan age. In the time of Pope, he tells his friend, it was all Horace with us. It is all Claudian now. For the great old masters of the art he had no very enthusiastic veneration. In his letter to Mr. Bowles he uses expressions which clearly indicate that he preferred Pope's Iliad to the original. Mr. Moore confesses that his friend was no very fervent admirer of Shakspeare. Of all the poets of the first class Lord Byron seems to have admired Dante and Milton most. Yet in the fourth canto of Childe Harold, he places Tasso, a writer not merely inferior to them, but of quite a different order of mind, on at least a footing of equality with them. Mr. Hunt is, we suspect, quite correct in saying that Lord Byron could see little or no merit in Spenser. But Byron the critic and Byron the poet were two very different men. The effects of the noble writer's theory may indeed often be traced in his practice. But his disposition led him to accommodate himself to the literary taste of the age in which he lived; and his talents would have enabled him to accommodate himself to the taste of any age. Though he said much of his contempt for mankind, and though he boasted that amidst the inconstancy of fortune and of fame he was all-sufficient to himself, his literary career indicated nothing of that lonely and unsocial pride which he affected. We cannot conceive him, like Milton or Wordsworth, defying the criticism of his contemporaries, retorting their scorn, and labouring on a poem in the full assurance that it would be unpopular, and in the full assurance that it would be immortal. He has said, by the mouth of one of his heroes, in speaking of political greatness, that "he must serve who fain would sway"; and this he assigns as a reason for not entering into political life. He did not consider that the sway which he had exercised in literature had been purchased by servitude, by the sacrifice of his own taste to the taste of the public. He was the creature of his age; and whenever he had lived he would have been the creature of his age. Under Charles the First Byron would have been more quaint than Donne. Under Charles the Second the rants of Byron's rhyming plays would have pitted it, boxed it, and galleried it, with those of any Bayes or Bilboa. Under George the First, the monotonous smoothness of Byron's versification and the terseness of his expression would have made Pope himself envious. As it was, he was the man of the last thirteen years of the eighteenth century, and of the first twenty-three years of the nineteenth century. He belonged half to the old, and half to the new school of poetry. His personal taste led him to the former; his thirst of praise to the latter; his talents were equally suited to both. His fame was a common ground on which the zealots on both sides, Gifford for example, and Shelley, might meet. He was the representative, not of either literary party, but of both at once, and of their conflict, and of the victory by which that conflict was terminated. His poetry fills and measures the whole of the vast interval through which our literature has moved since the time of Johnson. It touches the Essay on Man at the one extremity, and the Excursion at the other. There are several parallel instances in literary history. Voltaire, for example, was the connecting link between the France of Lewis the Fourteenth and the France of Lewis the Sixteenth, between Racine and Boileau on the one side, and Condorcet and Beaumarchais on the other. He, like Lord Byron, put himself at the head of an intellectual revolution, dreading it all the time, murmuring at it, sneering at it, yet choosing rather to move before his age in any direction than to be left behind and forgotten. Dryden was the connecting link between the literature of the age of James the First, and the literature of the age of Anne. Oromasdes and Arimanes fought for him. Arimanes carried him off. But his heart was to the last with Oromasdes. Lord Byron was, in the same manner, the mediator between two generations, between two hostile poetical sects. Though always sneering at Mr. Wordsworth, he was yet, though perhaps unconsciously, the interpreter between Mr. Wordsworth and the multitude. In the Lyrical Ballads and the Excursion Mr. Wordsworth appeared as the high priest of a worship, of which nature was the idol. No poems have ever indicated a more exquisite perception of the beauty of the outer world or a more passionate love and reverence for that beauty. Yet they were not popular; and it is not likely that they ever will be popular as the poetry of Sir Walter Scott is popular. The feeling which pervaded them was too deep for general sympathy. Their style was often too mysterious for general comprehension. They made a few esoteric disciples, and many scoffers. Lord Byron founded what may be called an exoteric Lake school; and all the readers of verse in England, we might say in Europe, hastened to sit at his feet. What Mr. Wordsworth had said like a recluse, Lord Byron said like a man of the world, with less profound feeling, but with more perspicuity, energy, and conciseness. We would refer our readers to the last two cantos of Childe Harold and to Manfred, in proof of these observations. Lord Byron, like Mr. Wordsworth, had nothing dramatic in his genius. He was indeed the reverse of a great dramatist, the very antithesis to a great dramatist. All his characters, Harold looking on the sky, from which his country and the sun are disappearing together, the Giaour standing apart in the gloom of the side aisle, and casting a haggard scowl from under his long hood at the crucifix and the censer, Conrad leaning on his sword by the watch-tower, Lara smiling on the dancers, Alp gazing steadily on the fatal cloud as it passes before the moon, Manfred wandering among the precipices of Berne, Azzo on the judgment- seat, Ugo at the bar, Lambro frowning on the siesta of his daughter and Juan, Cain presenting his unacceptable offering, are essentially the same. The varieties are varieties merely of age, situation, and outward show. If ever Lord Byron attempted to exhibit men of a different kind, he always made them either insipid or unnatural. Selim is nothing. Bonnivart is nothing. Don Juan, in the first and best cantos, is a feeble copy of the Page in the Marriage of Figaro. Johnson, the man whom Juan meets in the slave-market, is a most striking failure. How differently would Sir Walter Scott have drawn a bluff, fearless Englishman, in such a situation! The portrait would have seemed to walk out of the canvas. Sardanapalus is more closely drawn than any dramatic personage that we can remember. His heroism and his effeminacy, his contempt of death and his dread of a weighty helmet, his kingly resolution to be seen in the foremost ranks, and the anxiety with which he calls for a looking-glass that he may be seen to advantage, are contrasted, it is true, with all the point of Juvenal. Indeed the hint of the character seems to have been taken from what Juvenal says of Otho:     "Speculum civilis sarcina belli. Nimirum summi ducis est occidere Galbam, Et curare cutem summi constantia civis, Bedriaci in campo spolium affectare Palati Et pressum in faciem digitis extendere panem." These are excellent lines in a satire. But it is not the business of the dramatist to exhibit characters in this sharp antithetical way. It is not thus that Shakspeare makes Prince Hal rise from the rake of Eastcheap into the hero of Shrewsbury, and sink again into the rake of Eastcheap. It is not thus that Shakspeare has exhibited the union of effeminacy and valour in Antony. A dramatist cannot commit a greater error than that of following those pointed descriptions of character in which satirists and historians indulge so much. It is by rejecting what is natural that satirists and historians produce these striking characters. Their great object generally is to ascribe to every man as many contradictory qualities as possible: and this is an object easily attained. By judicious selection and judicious exaggeration, the intellect and the disposition of any human being might be described as being made up of nothing but startling contrasts. If the dramatist attempts to create a being answering to one of these descriptions, he fails, because he reverses an imperfect analytical process. He produces, not a man, but a personified epigram. Very eminent writers have fallen into this snare. Ben Jonson has given us a Hermogenes, taken from the lively lines of Horace; but the inconsistency which is so amusing in the satire appears unnatural and disgusts us in the play. Sir Walter Scott has committed a far more glaring error of the same kind in the novel of Peveril. Admiring, as every judicious reader must admire, the keen and vigorous lines in which Dryden satirised the Duke of Buckingham, Sir Walter attempted to make a Duke of Buckingham to suit them, a real living Zimri; and he made, not a man, but the most grotesque of all monsters. A writer who should attempt to introduce into a play or a novel such a Wharton as the Wharton of Pope, or a Lord Hervey answering to Sporus, would fail in the same manner. But to return to Lord Byron; his women, like his men, are all of one breed. Haidee is a half-savage and girlish Julia; Julia is a civilised and matronly Haidee. Leila is a wedded Zuleika, Zuleika a virgin Leila. Gulnare and Medora appear to have been intentionally opposed to each other. Yet the difference is a difference of situation only. A slight change of circumstances would, it should seem, have sent Gulnare to the lute of Medora, and armed Medora with the dagger of Gulnare. It is hardly too much to say, that Lord Byron could exhibit only one man and only one woman, a man, proud, moody, cynical, with defiance on his brow, and misery in his heart, a scorner of his kind, implacable in revenge, yet capable of deep and strong affection: a woman all softness and gentleness, loving to caress and to be caressed, but capable of being transformed by passion into a tigress. Even these two characters, his only two characters, he could not exhibit dramatically. He exhibited them in the manner, not of Shakspeare, but of Clarendon. He analysed them; he made them analyse themselves; but he did not make them show themselves. We are told, for example, in many lines of great force and spirit, that the speech of Lara was bitterly sarcastic, that he talked little of his travels, that if he was much questioned about them, his answers became short, and his brow gloomy. But we have none of Lara's sarcastic speeches or short answers. It is not thus that the great masters of human nature have portrayed human beings. Homer never tells us that Nestor loved to relate long stories about his youth. Shakspeare never tells us that in the mind of Iago everything that is beautiful and endearing was associated with some filthy and debasing idea. It is curious to observe the tendency which the dialogue of Lord Byron always has to lose its character of a dialogue, and to become soliloquy. The scenes between Manfred and the Chamois- hunter, between Manfred and the Witch of the Alps, between Manfred and the Abbot, are instances of this tendency. Manfred, after a few unimportant speeches, has all the talk to himself. The other interlocutors are nothing more than good listeners. They drop an occasional question or ejaculation which sets Manfred off again on the inexhaustible topic of his personal feelings. If we examine the fine passages in Lord Byron's dramas, the description of Rome, for example, in Manfred, the description of a Venetian revel in Marino Faliero, the concluding invective which the old doge pronounces against Venice, we shall find that there is nothing dramatic in these speeches, that they derive none of their effect from the character or situation of the speaker, and that they would have been as fine, or finer, if they had been published as fragments of blank verse by Lord Byron. There is scarcely a speech in Shakspeare of which the same could be said. No skilful reader of the plays of Shakspeare can endure to see what are called the fine things taken out, under the name of "Beauties," or of "Elegant Extracts," or to hear any single passage, "To be or not to be," for example, quoted as a sample of the great poet. "To be or not to be" has merit undoubtedly as a composition. It would have merit if put into the mouth of a chorus. But its merit as a composition vanishes when compared with its merit as belonging to Hamlet. It is not too much to say that the great plays of Shakspeare would lose less by being deprived of all the passages which are commonly called the fine passages, than those passages lose by being read separately from the play. This is perhaps the highest praise which can be given to a dramatist. On the other hand, it may be doubted whether there is, in all Lord Byron's plays, a single remarkable passage which owes any portion of its interest or effect to its connection with the characters or the action. He has written only one scene, as far as we can recollect, which is dramatic even in manner--the scene between Lucifer and Cain. The conference is animated, and each of the interlocutors has a fair share of it. But this scene, when examined, will be found to be a confirmation of our remarks. It is a dialogue only in form. It is a soliloquy in essence. It is in reality a debate carried on within one single unquiet and sceptical mind. The questions and the answers, the objections and the solutions, all belong to the same character. A writer who showed so little dramatic skill in works professedly dramatic, was not likely to write narrative with dramatic effect. Nothing could indeed be more rude and careless than the structure of his narrative poems. He seems to have thought, with the hero of the Rehearsal, that the plot was good for nothing but to bring in fine things. His two longest works, Childe Harold and Don Juan, have no plan whatever. Either of them might have been extended to any length, or cut short at any point. The state in which the Giaour appears illustrates the manner in which all Byron's poems were constructed. They are all, like the Giaour, collections of fragments; and, though there may be no empty spaces marked by asterisks, it is still easy to perceive, by the clumsiness of the joining, where the parts for the sake of which the whole was composed end and begin. It was in description and meditation that Byron excelled. "Description," as he said in Don Juan, "was his forte." His manner is indeed peculiar, and is almost unequalled; rapid, sketchy, full of vigour; the selection happy, the strokes few and bold. In spite of the reverence which we feel for the genius of Mr. Wordsworth we cannot but think that the minuteness of his descriptions often diminishes their effect. He has accustomed himself to gaze on nature with the eye of a lover, to dwell on every feature, and to mark every change of aspect. Those beauties which strike the most negligent observer, and those which only a close attention discovers, are equally familiar to him and are equally prominent in his poetry. The proverb of old Hesiod, that half is often more than the whole, is eminently applicable to description. The policy of the Dutch, who cut down most of the precious trees in the Spice Islands, in order to raise the value of what remained, was a policy which poets would do well to imitate. It was a policy which no poet understood better than Lord Byron. Whatever his faults might be, he was never, while his mind retained its vigour, accused of prolixity. His descriptions, great as was their intrinsic merit, derived. their principal interest from the feeling which always mingled with them. He was himself the beginning, the middle, and the end, of all his own poetry, the hero of every tale, the chief object in every landscape. Harold, Lara, Manfred, and a crowd of other characters, were universally considered merely as loose incognitos of Byron; and there is every reason to believe that he meant them to be so considered. The wonders of the outer world, the Tagus, with the mighty fleets of England riding on its bosom, the towers of Cintra overhanging the shaggy forest of cork-trees and willows, the glaring marble of Pentelicus, the banks of the Rhine, the glaciers of Clarens, the sweet Lake of Leman, the dell of Egeria with its summer-birds and rustling lizards, the shapeless ruins of Rome overgrown with ivy and wall-flowers, the, stars, the sea, the mountains, all were mere accessories, the background to one dark and melancholy figure. Never had any writer so vast a command of the whole eloquence of scorn, misanthropy, and despair. That Marah was never dry. No art could sweeten, no draughts could exhaust, its perennial waters of bitterness. Never was there such variety in monotony as that of Byron. From maniac laughter to piercing lamentation, there was not a single note of human anguish of which he was not master. Year after year, and month after month, he continued to repeat that to be wretched is the destiny of all; that to be eminently wretched is the destiny of the eminent; that all the desires by which we are cursed lead alike to misery, if they are not gratified, to the misery of disappointment; if they are gratified, to the misery of satiety. His heroes are men who have arrived by different roads at the same goal of despair, who are sick of life, who are at war with society, who are supported in their anguish only by an unconquerable pride resembling that of Prometheus on the rock or of Satan in the burning marl, who can master their agonies by the force of their will, and who to the last defy the whole power of earth and heaven. He always described himself as a man of the same kind with his favourite creations, as a man whose heart had been withered, whose capacity for happiness was gone and could not be restored, but whose invincible spirit dared the worst that could befall him here or hereafter. How much of this morbid feeling sprang from an original disease of the mind, how much from real misfortune, how much from the nervousness of dissipation, how much was fanciful, how much was merely affected, it is impossible for us, and would probably have been impossible for the most intimate friends of Lord Byron, to decide. Whether there ever existed, or can ever exist, a person answering to the description which he gave of himself may be doubted; but that he was not such a person is beyond all doubt. It is ridiculous to imagine that a man whose mind was really imbued with scorn of his fellow-creatures would have published three or four books every year in order to tell them so; or that a man who could say with truth that he neither sought sympathy nor needed it would have admitted all Europe to hear his farewell to his wife, and his blessings on his child. In the second canto of Childe Harold, he tells us that he is insensible to fame and obloquy: "Ill may such contest now the spirit move, Which heeds nor keen reproof nor partial praise." Yet we know on the best evidence that, a day or two before he published these lines, he was greatly, indeed childishly, elated by the compliments paid to his maiden speech in the House of Lords. We are far, however, from thinking that his sadness was altogether feigned. He was naturally a man of great sensibility; he had been ill-educated; his feelings had been early exposed to sharp trials; he had been crossed in his boyish love; he had been mortified by the failure of his first literary efforts; he was straitened in pecuniary circumstances; he was unfortunate in his domestic relations; the public treated him with cruel injustice; his health and spirits suffered from his dissipated habits of life; he was, on the whole, an unhappy man. He early discovered that, by parading his unhappiness before the multitude, he produced an immense sensation. The world gave him every encouragement to talk about his mental sufferings. The interest which his first confessions excited induced him to affect much that he did not feel; and the affectation probably reacted on his feelings. How far the character in which he exhibited himself was genuine, and how far theatrical, it would probably have puzzled himself to say. There can be no doubt that this remarkable man owed the vast influence which he exercised over his contemporaries at least as much to his gloomy egotism as to the real power of his poetry. We never could very clearly understand how it is that egotism, so unpopular in conversation, should be so popular in writing; or how it is that men who affect in their compositions qualities and feelings which they have not, impose so much more easily on their contemporaries than on posterity. The interest which the loves of Petrarch excited in his own time, and the pitying fondness with which half Europe looked upon Rousseau, are well known. To readers of our age, the love of Petrarch seems to have been love of that kind which breaks no hearts, and the sufferings of Rousseau to have deserved laughter rather than pity, to have been partly counterfeited, and partly the consequences of his own perverseness and vanity. What our grandchildren may think of the character of Lord Byron, as exhibited in his poetry, we will not pretend to guess. It is certain, that the interest which he excited during his life is without a parallel in literary history. The feeling with which young readers of poetry regarded him can be conceived only by those who have experienced it. To people who are unacquainted with real calamity, "nothing is so dainty sweet as lovely melancholy." This faint image of sorrow has in all ages been considered by young gentlemen as an agreeable excitement. Old gentlemen and middle-aged gentlemen have so many real causes of sadness that they are rarely inclined "to be as sad as night only for wantonness." Indeed they want the power almost as much as the inclination. We know very few persons engaged in active life, who, even if they were to procure stools to be melancholy upon, and were to sit down with all the premeditation of Master Stephen, would be able to enjoy much of what somebody calls the "ecstasy of woe." Among that large class of young persons whose reading is almost entirely confined to works of imagination, the popularity of Lord Byron was unbounded. They bought pictures of him; they treasured up the smallest relics of him; they learned his poems by heart, and did their best to write like him, and to look like him. Many of them practised at the glass in the hope of catching the curl of the upper lip, and the scowl of the brow, which appear in some of his portraits. A few discarded their neck-cloths in imitation of their great leader. For some years the Minerva press sent forth no novel without a mysterious, unhappy, Lara-like peer. The number of hopeful undergraduates and medical students who became things of dark imaginings, on whom the freshness of the heart ceased to fall like dew, whose passions had consumed themselves to dust, and to whom the relief of tears was denied, passes all calculation. This was not the worst. There was created in the minds of many of these enthusiasts a pernicious and absurd association between intellectual power and moral depravity. From the poetry of Lord Byron they drew a system of ethics, compounded of misanthropy and voluptuousness, a system in which the two great commandments were, to hate your neighbour, and to love your neighbour's wife. This affectation has passed away; and a few more years will destroy whatever yet remains of that magical potency which once belonged to the name of Byron. To us he is still a man, young, noble, and unhappy. To our children he will be merely a writer; and their impartial judgment will appoint his place among writers; without regard to his rank or to his private history. That his poetry will undergo a severe sifting, that much of what has been admired by his contemporaries will be rejected as worthless, we have little doubt. But we have as little doubt that, after the closest scrutiny, there will still remain much that can only perish with the English language. MR. ROBERT MONTGOMERY (April 1830) 1. The Omnipresence of the Deity: a Poem By ROBERT MONTGOMERY. Eleventh Edition. London. 1830. 2. Satan: a Poem By ROBERT MONTGOMERY. Second Edition. London: 1830. THE wise men of antiquity loved to convey instruction under the covering of apologue; and though this practice is generally thought childish, we shall make no apology for adopting it on the present occasion. A generation which has bought eleven editions of a poem by Mr. Robert Montgomery may well condescend to listen to a fable of Pilpay. A pious Brahmin, it is written, made a vow that on a certain day he would sacrifice a sheep, and on the appointed morning he went forth to buy one. There lived in his neighbourhood three rogues who knew of his vow, and laid a scheme for profiting by it. The first met him and said, "Oh Brahmin, wilt thou buy a sheep? I have one fit for sacrifice." "It is for that very purpose," said the holy man, "that I came forth this day." Then the impostor opened a bag, and brought out of it an unclean beast, an ugly dog, lame and blind. Thereon the Brahmin cried out, "Wretch, who touchest things impure, and utterest things untrue; callest thou that cur a sheep?" "Truly," answered the other, "it is a sheep of the finest fleece, and of the sweetest flesh. Oh Brahmin, it will be an offering most acceptable to the gods." "Friend," said the Brahmin, either thou or I must be blind." Just then one of the accomplices came up. "Praised be the gods," said the second rogue, "that I have been saved the trouble of going to the market for a sheep! This is such a sheep as I wanted. For how much wilt thou sell it?" When the Brahmin heard this, his mind waved to and fro, like one swinging in the air at a holy festival. "Sir," said he to the new comer, "take heed what thou dost; this is no sheep, but an unclean cur." "Oh Brahmin," said the new corner, "thou art drunk or mad!" At this time the third confederate drew near. "Let us ask this man," said the Brahmin, "what the creature is, and I will stand by what he shall say." To this the others agreed; and the Brahmin called out, "Oh stranger, what dost thou call this beast?" "Surely, oh Brahmin," said the knave, "it is a fine sheep." Then the Brahmin said, "Surely the gods have taken away my senses"; and he asked pardon of him who carried the dog, and bought it for a measure of rice and a pot of ghee, and offered it up to the gods, who, being wroth at this unclean sacrifice, smote him with a sore disease in all his joints. Thus, or nearly thus, if we remember rightly, runs the story of the Sanscrit Aesop. The moral, like the moral of every fable that is worth the telling, lies on the surface. The writer evidently means to caution us against the practices of puffers, a class of people who have more than once talked the public into the most absurd errors, but who surely never played a more curious or a more difficult trick than when they passed Mr. Robert Montgomery off upon the world as a great poet. In an age in which there are so few readers that a writer cannot subsist on the sum arising from the sale of his works, no man who has not an independent fortune can devote himself to literary pursuits, unless he is assisted by patronage. In such an age, accordingly, men of letters too often pass their lives in dangling at the heels of the wealthy and powerful; and all the faults which dependence tends to produce, pass into their character. They become the parasites and slaves of the great. It is melancholy to think how many of the highest and most exquisitely formed of human intellects have been condemned to the ignominious labour of disposing the commonplaces of adulation in new forms and brightening them into new splendour. Horace invoking Augustus in the most enthusiastic language of religious veneration; Statius flattering a tyrant, and the minion of a tyrant, for a morsel of bread; Ariosto versifying the whole genealogy of a niggardly patron; Tasso extolling the heroic virtues of the wretched creature who locked him up in a madhouse: these are but a few of the instances which might easily be given of the degradation to which those must submit who, not possessing a competent fortune, are resolved to write when there are scarcely any who read. This evil the progress of the human mind tends to remove. As a taste for books becomes more and more common, the patronage of individuals becomes less and less necessary. In the middle of the last century a marked change took place. The tone of literary men, both in this country and in France, became higher and more independent. Pope boasted that he was the "one poet" who had "pleased by manly ways"; he derided the soft dedications with which Halifax had been fed, asserted his own superiority over the pensioned Boileau, and gloried in being not the follower, but the friend, of nobles and princes. The explanation of all this is very simple. Pope was the first Englishman who, by the mere sale of his writings, realised a sum which enabled him to live in comfort and in perfect independence. Johnson extols him for the magnanimity which he showed in inscribing his Iliad, not to a minister or a peer, but to Congreve. In our time this would scarcely be a subject for praise. Nobody is astonished when Mr. Moore pays a compliment of this kind to Sir Walter Scott, or Sir Walter Scott to Mr. Moore. The idea of either of those gentlemen looking out for some lord who would be likely to give him a few guineas in return for a fulsome dedication seems laughably incongruous. Yet this is exactly what Dryden or Otway would have done; and it would be hard to blame them for it. Otway is said to have been choked with a piece of bread which he devoured in the rage of hunger; and, whether this story be true or false, he was beyond all question miserably poor. Dryden, at near seventy, when at the head of the literary men of England, without equal or second, received three hundred pounds for his Fables, a collection of ten thousand verses, and of such verses as no man then living, except himself, could have produced, Pope, at thirty, had laid up between six and seven thousand pounds, the fruits of his poetry. It was not, we suspect, because he had a higher spirit or a more scrupulous conscience than his predecessors, but because he had a larger income, that he kept up the dignity of the literary character so much better than they had done. From the time of Pope to the present day the readers have been constantly becoming more and more numerous, and the writers, consequently, more and more independent. It is assuredly a great evil that men, fitted by their talents and acquirements to enlighten and charm the world, should be reduced to the necessity of flattering wicked and foolish patrons in return for the sustenance of life. But, though we heartily rejoice that this evil is removed, we cannot but see with concern that another evil has succeeded to it. The public is now the patron, and a most liberal patron. All that the rich and powerful bestowed on authors from the time of Maecenas to that of Harley would not, we apprehend, make up a sum equal to that which has been paid by English booksellers to authors during the last fifty years. Men of letters have accordingly ceased to court individuals, and have begun to court the public. They formerly used flattery. They now use puffing. Whether the old or the new vice be the worse, whether those who formerly lavished insincere praise on others, or those who now contrive by every art of beggary and bribery to stun the public with praises of themselves, disgrace their vocation the more deeply, we shall not attempt to decide. But of this we are sure, that it is high time to make a stand against the new trickery. The puffing of books is now so shamefully and so successfully carried on that it is the duty of all who are anxious for the purity of the national taste, or for the honour of the literary character, to join in discountenancing the practice. All the pens that ever were employed in magnifying Bish's lucky office, Romanis's fleecy hosiery, Packwood's razor strops, and Rowland's Kalydor, all the placard-bearers of Dr. Eady, all the wall- chalkers of Day and Martin, seem to have taken service with the poets and novelists of this generation. Devices which in the lowest trades are considered as disreputable are adopted without scruple, and improved upon with a despicable ingenuity, by people engaged in a pursuit which never was and never will be considered as a mere trade by any man of honour and virtue. A butcher of the higher class disdains to ticket his meat. A mercer of the higher class would be ashamed to hang up papers in his window inviting the passers-by to look at the stock of a bankrupt, all of the first quality, and going for half the value. We expect some reserve, some decent pride, in our hatter and our bootmaker. But no artifice by which notoriety can be obtained is thought too abject for a man of letters. It is amusing to think over the history of most of the publications which have had a run during the last few years. The publisher is often the publisher of some periodical work. In this periodical work the first flourish of trumpets is sounded. The peal is then echoed and re-echoed by all the other periodical works over which the publisher, or the author, or the author's coterie, may have any influence. The newspapers are for a fortnight filled with puffs of all the various kinds which Sheridan enumerated, direct, oblique, and collusive. Sometimes the praise is laid on thick for simple-minded people. "Pathetic," "sublime," "splendid," "graceful," "brilliant wit," "exquisite humour," and other phrases equally flattering, fall in a shower as thick and as sweet as the sugarplums at a Roman carnival. Sometimes greater art is used. A sinecure has been offered to the writer if he would suppress his work, or if he would even soften down a few of his incomparable portraits. A distinguished military and political character has challenged the inimitable satirist of the vices of the great; and the puffer is glad to learn that the parties have been bound over to keep the peace. Sometimes it is thought expedient that the puffer should put on a grave face, and utter his panegyric in the form of admonition. "Such attacks on private character cannot be too much condemned. Even the exuberant wit of our author, and the irresistible power of his withering sarcasm, are no excuses for that utter disregard which he manifests for the feelings of others. We cannot but wonder that a writer of such transcendent talents, a writer who is evidently no stranger to the kindly charities and sensibilities of our nature, should show so little tenderness to the foibles of noble and distinguished individuals, with whom it is clear, from every page of his work, that he must have been constantly mingling in society." These are but tame and feeble imitations of the paragraphs with which the daily papers are filled whenever an attorney's clerk or an apothecary's assistant undertakes to tell the public in bad English and worse French, how people tie their neckcloths and eat their dinners in Grosvenor Square. The editors of the higher and more respectable newspapers usually prefix the words "Advertisement," or "From a Correspondent," to such paragraphs. But this makes little difference. The panegyric is extracted, and the significant heading omitted. The fulsome eulogy makes its appearance on the covers of all the Reviews and Magazines, with Times or Globe affixed, though the editors of the Times and the Globe have no more to do with it than with Mr. Goss's way of making old rakes young again. That people who live by personal slander should practise these arts is not surprising. Those who stoop to write calumnious books may well stoop to puff them; and that the basest of all trades should be carried on in the basest of all manners is quite proper and as it should be. But how any man who has the least self- respect, the least regard for his own personal dignity, can condescend to persecute the public with this Ragfair importunity, we do not understand. Extreme poverty may, indeed, in some degree, be an excuse for employing these shifts, as it may be an excuse for stealing a leg of mutton. But we really think that a man of spirit and delicacy would quite as soon satisfy his wants in the one way as in the other. It is no excuse for an author that the praises of journalists are procured by the money or influence of his publishers, and not by his own. It is his business to take such precautions as may prevent others from doing what must degrade him. It is for his honour as a gentleman, and, if he is really a man of talents, it will eventually be for his honour and interest as a writer, that his works should come before the public recommended by their own merits alone, and should be discussed with perfect freedom. If his objects be really such as he may own without shame, he will find that they will, in the long-run, be better attained by suffering the voice of criticism to be fairly heard. At present, we too often see a writer attempting to obtain literary fame as Shakspeare's usurper obtains sovereignty. The publisher plays Buckingham to the author's Richard. Some few creatures of the conspiracy are dexterously disposed here and there in the crowd. It is the business of these hirelings to throw up their caps, and clap their hands, and utter their vivas. The rabble at first stare and wonder, and at last join in shouting for shouting's sake; and thus a crown is placed on a head which has no right to it, by the huzzas of a few servile dependants. The opinion of the great body of the reading public is very materially influenced even by the unsupported assertions of those who assume a right to criticise. Nor is the public altogether to blame on this account. Most even of those who have really a great enjoyment in reading are in the same state, with respect to a book, in which a man who has never given particular attention to the art of painting is with respect to a picture. Every man who has the least sensibility or imagination derives a certain pleasure from pictures. Yet a man of the highest and finest intellect might, unless he had formed his taste by contemplating the best pictures, be easily persuaded by a knot of connoisseurs that the worst daub in Somerset House was a miracle of art. If he deserves to be laughed at, it is not for his ignorance of pictures, but for his ignorance of men. He knows that there is a delicacy of taste in painting which he does not possess, that he cannot distinguish hands, as practised judges distinguish them, that he is not familiar with the finest models, that he has never looked at them with close attention, and that, when the general effect of a piece has pleased him or displeased him, he has never troubled himself to ascertain why. When, therefore, people, whom he thinks more competent to judge than himself, and of whose sincerity he entertains no doubt, assure him that a particular work is exquisitely beautiful, he takes it for granted that they must be in the right. He returns to the examination, resolved to find or imagine beauties; and, if he can work himself up into something like admiration, he exults in his own proficiency. Just such is the manner in which nine readers out of ten judge of a book. They are ashamed to dislike what men who speak as having authority declare to be good. At present, however contemptible a poem or a novel may be, there is not the least difficulty in procuring favourable notices of it from all sorts of publications, daily, weekly, and monthly. In the meantime, little or nothing is said on the other side. The author and the publisher are interested in crying up the book. Nobody has any very strong interest in crying it down. Those who are best fitted to guide the public opinion think it beneath them to expose mere nonsense, and comfort themselves by reflecting that such popularity cannot last. This contemptuous lenity has been carried too far. It is perfectly true that reputations which have been forced into an unnatural bloom fade almost as soon as they have expanded; nor have we any apprehensions that puffing will ever raise any scribbler to the rank of a classic. It is indeed amusing to turn over some late volumes of periodical works, and to see how many immortal productions have, within a few months, been gathered to the poems of Blackmore and the novels of Mrs. Behn; how many "profound views of human nature," and "exquisite delineations of fashionable manners," and "vernal, and sunny, and refreshing thoughts," and "high imaginings," and "young breathings," and "embodyings," and "pinings," and "minglings with the beauty of the universe," and "harmonies which dissolve the soul in a passionate sense of loveliness and divinity," the world has contrived to forget. The names of the books and of the writers are buried in as deep an oblivion as the name of the builder of Stonehenge. Some of the well-puffed fashionable novels of eighteen hundred and twenty-nine hold the pastry of eighteen hundred and thirty; and others, which are now extolled in language almost too high-flown for the merits of Don Quixote, will, we have no doubt, line the trunks of eighteen hundred and thirty-one. But, though we have no apprehensions that puffing will ever confer permanent reputation on the undeserving, we still think its influence most pernicious. Men of real merit will, if they persevere, at last reach the station to which they are entitled, and intruders will be ejected with contempt and derision. But it is no small evil that the avenues to fame should be blocked up by a swarm of noisy, pushing, elbowing pretenders, who, though they will not ultimately be able to make good their own entrance, hinder, in the mean time, those who have a right to enter. All who will not disgrace themselves by joining in the unseemly scuffle must expect to be at first hustled and shouldered back. Some men of talents, accordingly, turn away in dejection from pursuits in which success appears to bear no proportion to desert. Others employ in self-defence the means by which competitors, far inferior to themselves, appear for a time to obtain a decided advantage. There are few who have sufficient confidence in their own powers and sufficient elevation of mind, to wait with secure and contemptuous patience, while dunce after dunce presses before them. Those who will not stoop to the baseness of the modern fashion are too often discouraged. Those who do stoop to it are always degraded. We have of late observed with great pleasure some symptoms which lead us to hope that respectable literary men of all parties are beginning to be impatient of this insufferable nuisance. And we purpose to do what in us lies for the abating of it. We do not think that we can more usefully assist in this good work than by showing our honest countrymen what that sort of poetry is which puffing can drive through eleven editions, and how easily any bellman might, if a bellman would stoop to the necessary degree of meanness, become a "master-spirit of the age." We have no enmity to Mr. Robert Montgomery. We know nothing whatever about him, except what we have learned from his books, and from the portrait prefixed to one of them, in which he appears to be doing his very best to look like a man of genius and sensibility, though with less success than his strenuous exertions deserve. We select him, because his works have received more enthusiastic praise, and have deserved more unmixed contempt, than any which, as far as our knowledge extends, have appeared within the last three or four years. His writing bears the same relation to poetry which a Turkey carpet bears to a picture. There are colours in the Turkey carpet out of which a picture might be made. There are words In Mr. Montgomery's writing which, when disposed in certain orders and combinations, have made, and will again make, good poetry. But, as they now stand, they seem to be put together on principle in such a manner as to give no image of anything "in the heavens above, or in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth." The poem on the Omnipresence of the Deity commences with a description of the creation, in which we can find only one thought which has the least pretension to ingenuity, and that one thought is stolen from Dryden, and marred in the stealing: "Last, softly beautiful, as music's close, Angelic woman into being rose." The all-pervading influence of the Supreme Being is then described in a few tolerable lines borrowed from Pope, and a great many intolerable lines of Mr. Robert Montgomery's own. The following may stand as a specimen: "But who could trace Thine unrestricted course, Though Fancy followed with immortal force? There's not a blossom fondled by the breeze, There's not a fruit that beautifies the trees, There's not a particle in sea or air, But nature owns thy plastic influence there! With fearful gaze, still be it mine to see How all is fill'd and vivified by Thee; Upon thy mirror, earth's majestic view, To paint Thy Presence, and to feel it too." The last two lines contain an excellent specimen of Mr. Robert Montgomery's Turkey carpet style of writing. The majestic view of earth is the mirror of God's presence; and on this mirror Mr. Robert Montgomery paints God's presence. The use of a mirror, we submit, is not to be painted upon. A few more lines, as bad as those which we have quoted, bring us to one of the most amusing instances of literary pilfering which we remember. It might be of use to plagiarists to know, as a general rule, that what they steal is, to employ a phrase common in advertisements, of no use to any but the right owner. We never fell in, however, with any plunderer who so little understood how to turn his booty to good account as Mr. Montgomery. Lord Byron, in a passage which everybody knows by heart, has said, addressing the sea, "Time writes no wrinkle on thine azure brow." Mr. Robert Montgomery very coolly appropriates the image and reproduces the stolen goods in the following form: "And thou vast Ocean, on whose awful face Time's iron feet can print no ruin-trace." So may such ill-got gains ever prosper! The effect which the Ocean produces on Atheists is then described in the following lofty lines: "Oh! never did the dark-soul'd ATHEIST stand, And watch the breakers boiling on the strand, And, while Creation stagger'd at his nod, Mock the dread presence of the mighty God! We hear Him in the wind-heaved ocean's roar, Hurling her billowy crags upon the shore We hear Him in the riot of the blast, And shake, while rush the raving whirlwinds past!" If Mr. Robert Montgomery's genius were not far too free and aspiring to be shackled by the rules of syntax, we should suppose that it is at the nod of the Atheist that creation staggers. But Mr. Robert Montgomery's readers must take such grammar as they can get, and be thankful. A few more lines bring us to another instance of unprofitable theft. Sir Walter Scott has these lines in the Lord of the Isles: "The dew that on the violet lies, Mocks the dark lustre of thine eyes." This is pretty taken separately, and, as is always the case with the good things of good writers, much prettier in its place than can even be conceived by those who see it only detached from the context. Now for Mr. Montgomery: "And the bright dew-bead on the bramble lies, Like liquid rapture upon beauty's eyes." The comparison of a violet, bright with the dew, to a woman's eyes, is as perfect as a comparison can be. Sir Walter's lines are part of a song addressed to a woman at daybreak, when the violets are bathed in dew; and the comparison is therefore peculiarly natural and graceful. Dew on a bramble is no more like a woman's eyes than dew anywhere else. There is a very pretty Eastern tale of which the fate of plagiarists often reminds us. The slave of a magician saw his master wave his wand, and heard him give orders to the spirits who arose at the summons. The slave stole the wand, and waved it himself in the air; but he had not observed that his master used the left hand for that purpose. The spirits thus irregularly summoned tore the thief to pieces instead of obeying his orders. There are very few who can safely venture to conjure with the rod of Sir Walter; and Mr. Robert Montgomery is not one of them. Mr. Campbell, in one of his most pleasing pieces, has this line, "The sentinel stars set their watch in the sky." The thought is good, and has a very striking propriety where Mr. Campbell has placed it, in the mouth of a soldier telling his dream. But, though Shakspeare assures us that "every true man's apparel fits your thief," it is by no means the case, as we have already seen, that every true poet's similitude fits your plagiarist. Let us see how Mr. Robert Montgomery uses the image. "Ye quenchless stars! so eloquently bright, Untroubled sentries of the shadowy night, While half the world is lapp'd in downy dreams, And round the lattice creep your midnight beams, How sweet to gaze upon your placid eyes, In lambent beauty looking from the skies." Certainly the ideas of eloquence, of untroubled repose, of placid eyes, of the lambent beauty on which it is sweet to gaze, harmonise admirably with the idea of a sentry. We would not be understood, however, to say, that Mr. Robert Montgomery cannot make similitudes for himself. A very few lines further on, we find one which has every mark of originality, and on which, we will be bound, none of the poets whom he has plundered will ever think of making reprisals "The soul, aspiring, pants its source to mount, As streams meander level with their fount." We take this to be, on the whole, the worst similitude in the world. In the first place, no stream meanders, or can possibly meander, level with its fount. In the next place, if streams did meander level with their founts, no two motions can be less like each other than that of meandering level and that of mounting upwards. We have then an apostrophe to the Deity, couched in terms which, in any writer who dealt in meanings, we should call profane, but to which we suppose Mr. Robert Montgomery attaches no idea whatever: "Yes I pause and think, within one fleeting hour, How vast a universe obeys Thy power; Unseen, but felt, Thine interfused control Works in each atom, and pervades the whole; Expands the blossom, and erects the tree, Conducts each vapour, and commands each sea, Beams in each ray, bids whirlwinds be unfurl'd, Unrols the thunder, and upheaves a world!" No field-preacher surely ever carried his irreverent familiarity so far as to bid the Supreme Being stop and think on the importance of the interests which are under His care. The grotesque indecency of such an address throws into shade the subordinate absurdities of the passage, the unfurling of whirlwinds, the unrolling of thunder, and the upheaving of worlds. Then comes a curious specimen of our poet's English: "Yet not alone created realms engage Thy faultless wisdom, grand, primeval sage! For all the thronging woes to life allied Thy mercy tempers, and thy cares provide." We should be glad to know what the word "For" means here. If it is a preposition, it makes nonsense of the words, "Thy mercy tempers." If it is an adverb, it makes nonsense of the words, "Thy cares provide." These beauties we have taken, almost at random, from the first part of the poem. The second part is a series of descriptions of various events, a battle, a murder, an execution, a marriage, a funeral, and so forth. Mr. Robert Montgomery terminates each of these descriptions by assuring us that the Deity was present at the battle, murder, execution, marriage or funeral in question. And this proposition which might be safely predicated of every event that ever happened or ever will happen, forms the only link which connects these descriptions with the subject or with each other. How the descriptions are executed our readers are probably by this time able to conjecture. The battle is made up of the battles of all ages and nations: "red-mouthed cannons, uproaring to the clouds," and "hands grasping firm the glittering shield." The only military operations of which this part of the poem reminds us, are those which reduced the Abbey of Quedlinburgh to submission, the Templar with his cross, the Austrian and Prussian grenadiers in full uniform, and Curtius and Dentatus with their battering-ram. We ought not to pass unnoticed the slain war- horse, who will no more "Roll his red eye, and rally for the fight"; or the slain warrior who, while "lying on his bleeding breast," contrives to "stare ghastly and grimly on the skies." As to this last exploit, we can only say, as Dante did on a similar occasion, "Forse per forza gia di' parlasia Si stravolse cosi alcun del tutto Ma io nol vidi, ne credo che sia." The tempest is thus described: "But lo! around the marsh'lling clouds unite, Like thick battalions halting for the fight; The sun sinks back, the tempest spirits sweep Fierce through the air and flutter on the deep. Till from their caverns rush the maniac blasts, Tear the loose sails, and split the creaking masts, And the lash'd billows, rolling in a train, Rear their white heads, and race along the main" What, we should like to know, is the difference between the two operations which Mr. Robert Montgomery so accurately distinguishes from each other, the fierce sweeping of the tempest-spirits through the air, and the rushing of the maniac blasts from their caverns? And why does the former operation end exactly when the latter commences? We cannot stop over each of Mr. Robert Montgomery's descriptions. We have a shipwrecked sailor, who "visions a viewless temple in the air"; a murderer who stands on a heath, "with ashy lips, in cold convulsion spread"; a pious man, to whom, as he lies in bed at night, "The panorama of past life appears, Warms his pure mind, and melts it into tears": a traveller, who loses his way, owing to the thickness of the "cloud-battalion," and the want of "heaven-lamps, to beam their holy light." We have a description of a convicted felon, stolen from that incomparable passage in Crabbe's Borough, which has made many a rough and cynical reader cry like a child. We can, however, conscientiously declare that persons of the most excitable sensibility may safely venture upon Mr, Robert Montgomery's version. Then we have the "poor, mindless, pale- faced maniac boy," who                  "Rolls his vacant eye To greet the glowing fancies of the sky." What are the glowing fancies of the sky? And what is the meaning of the two lines which almost immediately follow? "A soulless thing, a spirit of the woods, He loves to commune with the fields and floods." How can a soulless thing be a spirit? Then comes a panegyric on the Sunday. A baptism follows; after that a marriage: and we then proceed, in due course, to the visitation of the sick, and the burial of the dead. Often as Death has been personified, Mr. Montgomery has found something new to say about him: "O Death! thou dreadless vanquisher of earth, The Elements shrank blasted at thy birth! Careering round the world like tempest wind, Martyrs before, and victims strew'd behind Ages on ages cannot grapple thee, Dragging the world into eternity!" If there be any one line in this passage about which we are more in the dark than about the rest, it is the fourth. What the difference may be between the victims and the martyrs, and why the martyrs are to lie before Death, and the victims behind him, are to us great mysteries. We now come to the third part, of which we may say with honest Cassio, "Why, this is a more excellent song than the other." Mr. Robert Montgomery is very severe on the infidels, and undertakes to prove, that, as he elegantly expresses it, "One great Enchanter helm'd the harmonious whole." What an enchanter has to do with helming, or what a helm has to do with harmony, he does not explain. He proceeds with his argument thus: "And dare men dream that dismal Chance has framed All that the eye perceives, or tongue has named The spacious world, and all its wonders, born Designless, self-created, and forlorn; Like to the flashing bubbles on a stream, Fire from the cloud, or phantom in a dream?" We should be sorry to stake our faith in a higher Power on Mr. Robert Montgomery's logic. He informs us that lightning is designless and self-created. If he can believe this, we cannot conceive why he may not believe that the whole universe is designless and self-created. A few lines before, he tells us that it is the Deity who bids "thunder rattle from the skiey deep." His theory is therefore this, that God made the thunder, but that the lightning made itself. But Mr. Robert Montgomery's metaphysics are not at present our game. He proceeds to set forth the fearful effects of Atheism "Then, blood-stain`d Murder, bare thy hideous arm And thou, Rebellion, welter in thy storm: Awake, ye spirits of avenging crime; Burst from your bonds, and battle with the time!" Mr. Robert Montgomery is fond of personification, and belongs, we need not say, to that school of poets who hold that nothing more is necessary to a personification in poetry than to begin a word with a capital letter. Murder may, without impropriety, bare her arm, as she did long ago, in Mr. Campbell's Pleasures of Hope. But what possible motive Rebellion can have for weltering in her storm, what avenging crime may be, who its spirits may be, why they should be burst from their bonds, what their bonds may be, why they should battle with the time, what the time may be, and what a battle between the time and the spirits of avenging crime would resemble, we must confess ourselves quite unable to understand. "And here let Memory turn her tearful glance On the dark horrors of tumultuous France, When blood and blasphemy defiled her land, And fierce Rebellion shook her savage hand." Whether Rebellion shakes her own hand, shakes the hand of Memory, or shakes the hand of France, or what any one of these three metaphors would mean, we, know no more than we know what is the sense of the following passage "Let the foul orgies of infuriate crime Picture the raging havoc of that time, When leagued Rebellion march'd to kindle man, Fright in her rear, and Murder in her van. And thou, sweet flower of Austria, slaughter'd Queen, Who dropp'd no tear upon the dreadful scene, When gush'd the life-blood from thine angel form, And martyr'd beauty perish'd in the storm, Once worshipp'd paragon of all who saw, Thy look obedience, and thy smile a law." What is the distinction between the foul orgies and the raging havoc which the foul orgies are to picture? Why does Fright go behind Rebellion, and Murder before? Why should not Murder fall behind Fright? Or why should not all the three walk abreast? We have read of a hero who had "Amazement in his van, with flight combined, And Sorrow's faded form, and Solitude behind." Gray, we suspect, could have given a reason for disposing the allegorical attendants of Edward thus. But to proceed, "Flower of Austria" is stolen from Byron. "Dropp'd" is false English. "Perish'd in the storm" means nothing at all; and "thy look obedience" means the very reverse of what Mr. Robert Montgomery intends to say. Our poet then proceeds to demonstrate the immortality of the soul: "And shall the soul, the fount of reason, die, When dust and darkness round its temple lie? Did God breathe in it no ethereal fire. Dimless and quenchless, though the breath expire?" The soul is a fountain; and therefore it is not to die, though dust and darkness lie round its temple, because an ethereal fire has been breathed into it, which cannot be quenched though its breath expire. Is it the fountain, or the temple, that breathes, and has fire breathed into it? Mr. Montgomery apostrophises the "Immortal beacons,--spirits of the just,"-- and describes their employments in another world, which are to be, it seems, bathing in light, hearing fiery streams flow, and riding on living cars of lightning. The deathbed of the sceptic is described with what we suppose is meant for energy. We then have the deathbed of a Christian made as ridiculous as false imagery and false English can make it. But this is not enough. The Day of Judgment is to be described, and a roaring cataract of nonsense is poured forth upon this tremendous subject. Earth, we are told, is dashed into Eternity. Furnace blazes wheel round the horizon, and burst into bright wizard phantoms. Racing hurricanes unroll and whirl quivering fire-clouds. The white waves gallop. Shadowy worlds career around. The red and raging eye of Imagination is then forbidden to pry further. But further Mr. Robert Montgomery persists in prying. The stars bound through the airy roar. The unbosomed deep yawns on the ruin. The billows of Eternity then begin to advance. The world glares in fiery slumber. A car comes forward driven by living thunder, "Creation shudders with sublime dismay, And in a blazing tempest whirls away." And this is fine poetry! This is what ranks its writer with the master-spirits of the age! This is what has been described, over and over again, in terms which would require some qualification if used respecting Paradise Lost! It is too much that this patchwork, made by stitching together old odds and ends of what, when new, was but tawdry frippery, is to be picked off the dunghill on which it ought to rot, and to be held up to admiration as an inestimable specimen of art. And what must we think of a system by means of which verses like those which we have quoted, verses fit only for the poet's corner of the Morning Post, can produce emolument and fame? The circulation of this writer's poetry has been greater than that of Southey's Roderick, and beyond all comparison greater than that of Cary's Dante or of the best works of Coleridge. Thus encouraged, Mr. Robert Montgomery has favoured the public with volume after volume. We have given so much space to the examination of his first and most popular performance that we have none to spare for his Universal Prayer, and his smaller poems, which, as the puffing journals tell us, would alone constitute a sufficient title to literary immortality. We shall pass at once to his last publication, entitled Satan. This poem was ushered into the world with the usual roar of acclamation. But the thing was now past a joke. Pretensions so unfounded, so impudent, and so successful, had aroused a spirit of resistance. In several magazines and reviews, accordingly, Satan has been handled somewhat roughly, and the arts of the puffers have been exposed with good sense and spirit. We shall, therefore, be very concise. Of the two poems we rather prefer that on the Omnipresence of the Deity, for the same reason which induced Sir Thomas More to rank one bad book above another. "Marry, this is somewhat. This is rhyme. But the other is neither rhyme nor reason." Satan is a long soliloquy, which the Devil pronounces in five or six thousand lines of bad blank verse, concerning geography, politics, newspapers, fashionable society, theatrical amusements, Sir Walter Scott's novels, Lord Byron's poetry, and Mr. Martin's pictures. The new designs for Milton have, as was natural, particularly attracted the attention of a personage who occupies so conspicuous a place in them. Mr. Martin must be pleased to learn that, whatever may be thought of those performances on earth, they give full satisfaction in Pandaemonium, and that he is there thought to have hit off the likenesses of the various Thrones and Dominations very happily. The motto to the poem of Satan is taken from the Book of Job: "Whence comest thou? From going to and fro in the earth, and walking up and down in it." And certainly Mr. Robert Montgomery has not failed to make his hero go to and fro, and walk up and down. With the exception, however, of this propensity to locomotion, Satan has not one Satanic quality. Mad Tom had told us that "the prince of darkness is a gentleman"; but we had yet to learn that he is a respectable and pious gentleman, whose principal fault is that he is something of a twaddle and far too liberal of his good advice. That happy change in his character which Origen anticipated, and of which Tillotson did not despair, seems to be rapidly taking place. Bad habits are not eradicated in a moment. It is not strange, therefore, that so old an offender should now and then relapse for a short time into wrong dispositions. But to give him his due, as the proverb recommends, we must say that he always returns, after two or three lines of impiety, to his preaching style. We would seriously advise Mr. Montgomery to omit or alter about a hundred lines in different parts of this large volume, and to republish it under the name of Gabriel. The reflections of which it consists would come less absurdly, as far as there is a more and a less in extreme absurdity, from a good than from a bad angel. We can afford room only for a single quotation. We give one taken at random, neither worse nor better, as far as we can perceive, than any other equal number of lines in the book. The Devil goes to the play, and moralises thereon as follows: "Music and Pomp their mingling spirit shed Around me: beauties in their cloud-like robes Shine forth,--a scenic paradise, it glares Intoxication through the reeling sense Of flush'd enjoyment. In the motley host Three prime gradations may be rank'd: the first, To mount upon the wings of Shakspeare's mind, And win a flash of his Promethean thought, To smile and weep, to shudder, and achieve A round of passionate omnipotence, Attend: the second, are a sensual tribe, Convened to hear romantic harlots sing, On forms to banquet a lascivious gaze, While the bright perfidy of wanton eyes Through brain and spirit darts delicious fire The last, a throng most pitiful! who seem, With their corroded figures, rayless glance, And death-like struggle of decaying age, Like painted skeletons in charnel pomp Set forth to satirise the human kind! How fine a prospect for demoniac view! 'Creatures whose souls outbalance worlds awake!' Methinks I hear a pitying angel cry." Here we conclude. If our remarks give pain to Mr. Robert Montgomery, we are sorry for it. But, at whatever cost of pain to individuals, literature must be purified from this taint. And, to show that we are not actuated by any feeling of personal enmity towards him, we hereby give notice that, as soon as any book shall, by means of puffing, reach a second edition, our intention is to do unto the writer of it as we have done unto Mr. Robert Montgomery.

THE IMITATION OF CHRIST by Thomas a Kempis Translated by Rev. William Benham INTRODUCTORY NOTE The treatise "Of the Imitation of Christ" appears to have been originally written in Latin early in the fifteenth century.  Its exact date and its authorship are still a matter of debate. Manuscripts of the Latin version survive in considerable numbers all over Western Europe, and they, with the vast list of translations and of printed editions, testify to its almost unparalleled popularity.  One scribe attributes it to St. Bernard of Clairvaux; but the fact that it contains a quotation from St. Francis of Assisi, who was born thirty years after the death of St. Bernard, disposes of this theory.  In England there exist many manuscripts of the first three books, called "Musica Ecclesiastica," frequently ascribed to the English mystic Walter Hilton.  But Hilton seems to have died in 1395, and there is no evidence of the existence of the work before 1400.  Many manuscripts scattered throughout Europe ascribe the book to Jean le Charlier de Gerson, the great Chancellor of the University of Paris, who was a leading figure in the Church in the earlier part of the fifteenth century.  The most probable author, however, especially when the internal evidence is considered, is Thomas Haemmerlein, known also as Thomas a Kempis, from his native town of Kempen, near the Rhine, about forty miles north of Cologne.  Haemmerlein, who was born in 1379 or 1380, was a member of the order of the Brothers of Common Life, and spent the last seventy years of his life at Mount St. Agnes, a monastery of Augustinian canons in the diocese of Utrecht.  Here he died on July 26, 1471, after an uneventful life spent in copying manuscripts, reading, and composing, and in the peaceful routine of monastic piety. With the exception of the Bible, no Christian writing has had so wide a vogue or so sustained a popularity as this.  And yet, in one sense, it is hardly an original work at all.  Its structure it owes largely to the writings of the medieval mystics, and its ideas and phrases are a mosaic from the Bible and the Fathers of the early Church.  But these elements are interwoven with such delicate skill and a religious feeling at once so ardent and so sound, that it promises to remain, what it has been for five hundred years, the supreme call and guide to spiritual aspiration. THE IMITATION OF CHRIST THE FIRST BOOK ADMONITIONS PROFITABLE FOR THE SPIRITUAL LIFE CHAPTER I Of the imitation of Christ, and of contempt of the world and all its vanities He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness,(1) saith the Lord.  These are the words of Christ; and they teach us how far we must imitate His life and character, if we seek true illumination, and deliverance from all blindness of heart.  Let it be our most earnest study, therefore, to dwell upon the life of Jesus Christ. 2. His teaching surpasseth all teaching of holy men, and such as have His Spirit find therein the hidden manna.(2)  But there are many who, though they frequently hear the Gospel, yet feel but little longing after it, because they have not the mind of Christ.  He, therefore, that will fully and with true wisdom understand the words of Christ, let him strive to conform his whole life to that mind of Christ. 3. What doth it profit thee to enter into deep discussion concerning the Holy Trinity, if thou lack humility, and be thus displeasing to the Trinity?  For verily it is not deep words that make a man holy and upright; it is a good life which maketh a man dear to God.  I had rather feel contrition than be skilful in the definition thereof.  If thou knewest the whole Bible, and the sayings of all the philosophers, what should all this profit thee without the love and grace of God?  Vanity of vanities, all is vanity, save to love God, and Him only to serve.  That is the highest wisdom, to cast the world behind us, and to reach forward to the heavenly kingdom. 4. It is vanity then to seek after, and to trust in, the riches that shall perish.  It is vanity, too, to covet honours, and to lift up ourselves on high.  It is vanity to follow the desires of the flesh and be led by them, for this shall bring misery at the last.  It is vanity to desire a long life, and to have little care for a good life.  It is vanity to take thought only for the life which now is, and not to look forward to the things which shall be hereafter.  It is vanity to love that which quickly passeth away, and not to hasten where eternal joy abideth. 5. Be ofttimes mindful of the saying,(3) The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear with hearing.  Strive, therefore, to turn away thy heart from the love of the things that are seen, and to set it upon the things that are not seen.  For they who follow after their own fleshly lusts, defile the conscience, and destroy the grace of God. (1) John viii. 12.   (2) Revelations ii. 17. (3) Ecclesiastes i. 8. CHAPTER II Of thinking humbly of oneself There is naturally in every man a desire to know, but what profiteth knowledge without the fear of God?  Better of a surety is a lowly peasant who serveth God, than a proud philosopher who watcheth the stars and neglecteth the knowledge of himself.  He who knoweth himself well is vile in his own sight; neither regardeth he the praises of men.  If I knew all the things that are in the world, and were not in charity, what should it help me before God, who is to judge me according to my deeds? 2. Rest from inordinate desire of knowledge, for therein is found much distraction and deceit.  Those who have knowledge desire to appear learned, and to be called wise.  Many things there are to know which profiteth little or nothing to the soul.  And foolish out of measure is he who attendeth upon other things rather than those which serve to his soul's health.  Many words satisfy not the soul, but a good life refresheth the mind, and a pure conscience giveth great confidence towards God. 3. The greater and more complete thy knowledge, the more severely shalt thou be judged, unless thou hast lived holily.  Therefore be not lifted up by any skill or knowledge that thou hast; but rather fear concerning the knowledge which is given to thee.  If it seemeth to thee that thou knowest many things, and understandest them well, know also that there are many more things which thou knowest not.  Be not high-minded, but rather confess thine ignorance.  Why desirest thou to lift thyself above another, when there are found many more learned and more skilled in the Scripture than thou?  If thou wilt know and learn anything with profit, love to be thyself unknown and to be counted for nothing. 4. That is the highest and most profitable lesson, when a man truly knoweth and judgeth lowly of himself.  To account nothing of one's self, and to think always kindly and highly of others, this is great and perfect wisdom.  Even shouldest thou see thy neighbor sin openly or grievously, yet thou oughtest not to reckon thyself better than he, for thou knowest not how long thou shalt keep thine integrity.  All of us are weak and frail; hold thou no man more frail than thyself. CHAPTER III Of the knowledge of truth Happy is the man whom Truth by itself doth teach, not by figures and transient words, but as it is in itself.(1)  Our own judgment and feelings often deceive us, and we discern but little of the truth.  What doth it profit to argue about hidden and dark things, concerning which we shall not be even reproved in the judgment, because we knew them not?  Oh, grievous folly, to neglect the things which are profitable and necessary, and to give our minds to things which are curious and hurtful!  Having eyes, we see not. 2. And what have we to do with talk about genus and species! He to whom the Eternal Word speaketh is free from multiplied questionings.  From this One Word are all things, and all things speak of Him; and this is the Beginning which also speaketh unto us.(2)  No man without Him understandeth or rightly judgeth.  The man to whom all things are one, who bringeth all things to one, who seeth all things in one, he is able to remain steadfast of spirit, and at rest in God.  O God, who art the Truth, make me one with Thee in everlasting love.  It wearieth me oftentimes to read and listen to many things; in Thee is all that I wish for and desire.  Let all the doctors hold their peace; let all creation keep silence before Thee: speak Thou alone to me. 3. The more a man hath unity and simplicity in himself, the more things and the deeper things he understandeth; and that without labour, because he receiveth the light of understanding from above.  The spirit which is pure, sincere, and steadfast, is not distracted though it hath many works to do, because it doth all things to the honour of God, and striveth to be free from all thoughts of self-seeking.  Who is so full of hindrance and annoyance to thee as thine own undisciplined heart?  A man who is good and devout arrangeth beforehand within his own heart the works which he hath to do abroad; and so is not drawn away by the desires of his evil will, but subjecteth everything to the judgment of right reason.  Who hath a harder battle to fight than he who striveth for self-mastery?  And this should be our endeavour, even to master self, and thus daily to grow stronger than self, and go on unto perfection. 4. All perfection hath some imperfection joined to it in this life, and all our power of sight is not without some darkness.  A lowly knowledge of thyself is a surer way to God than the deep searching of man's learning.  Not that learning is to be blamed, nor the taking account of anything that is good; but a good conscience and a holy life is better than all.  And because many seek knowledge rather than good living, therefore they go astray, and bear little or no fruit. 5. O if they would give that diligence to the rooting out of vice and the planting of virtue which they give unto vain questionings: there had not been so many evil doings and stumbling-blocks among the laity, nor such ill living among houses of religion.  Of a surety, at the Day of Judgment it will be demanded of us, not what we have read, but what we have done; not how well we have spoken, but how holily we have lived.  Tell me, where now are all those masters and teachers, whom thou knewest well, whilst they were yet with you, and flourished in learning?  Their stalls are now filled by others, who perhaps never have one thought concerning them.  Whilst they lived they seemed to be somewhat, but now no one speaks of them. 6. Oh how quickly passeth the glory of the world away!  Would that their life and knowledge had agreed together!  For then would they have read and inquired unto good purpose.  How many perish through empty learning in this world, who care little for serving God.  And because they love to be great more than to be humble, therefore they "have become vain in their imaginations." He only is truly great, who hath great charity.  He is truly great who deemeth himself small, and counteth all height of honour as nothing.  He is the truly wise man, who counteth all earthly things as dung that he may win Christ.  And he is the truly learned man, who doeth the will of God, and forsaketh his own will. (1) Psalm xciv. 12; Numbers xii. 8.   (2) John viii. 25 (Vulg.). CHAPTER IV Of prudence in action We must not trust every word of others or feeling within ourselves, but cautiously and patiently try the matter, whether it be of God.  Unhappily we are so weak that we find it easier to believe and speak evil of others, rather than good.  But they that are perfect, do not give ready heed to every news-bearer, for they know man's weakness that it is prone to evil and unstable in words. 2. This is great wisdom, not to be hasty in action, or stubborn in our own opinions.  A part of this wisdom also is not to believe every word we hear, nor to tell others all that we hear, even though we believe it.  Take counsel with a man who is wise and of a good conscience; and seek to be instructed by one better than thyself, rather than to follow thine own inventions.  A good life maketh a man wise toward God, and giveth him experience in many things.  The more humble a man is in himself, and the more obedient towards God, the wiser will he be in all things, and the more shall his soul be at peace. CHAPTER V Of the reading of Holy Scriptures It is Truth which we must look for in Holy Writ, not cunning of words.  All Scripture ought to be read in the spirit in which it was written.  We must rather seek for what is profitable in Scripture, than for what ministereth to subtlety in discourse. Therefore we ought to read books which are devotional and simple, as well as those which are deep and difficult.  And let not the weight of the writer be a stumbling-block to thee, whether he be of little or much learning, but let the love of the pure Truth draw thee to read.  Ask not, who hath said this or that, but look to what he says. 2. Men pass away, but the truth of the Lord endureth for ever. Without respect of persons God speaketh to us in divers manners. Our own curiosity often hindereth us in the reading of holy writings, when we seek to understand and discuss, where we should pass simply on.  If thou wouldst profit by thy reading, read humbly, simply, honestly, and not desiring to win a character for learning.  Ask freely, and hear in silence the words of holy men; nor be displeased at the hard sayings of older men than thou, for they are not uttered without cause. CHAPTER VI Of inordinate affections Whensoever a man desireth aught above measure, immediately he becometh restless.  The proud and the avaricious man are never at rest; while the poor and lowly of heart abide in the multitude of peace.  The man who is not yet wholly dead to self, is soon tempted, and is overcome in small and trifling matters. It is hard for him who is weak in spirit, and still in part carnal and inclined to the pleasures of sense, to withdraw himself altogether from earthly desires.  And therefore, when he withdraweth himself from these, he is often sad, and easily angered too if any oppose his will. 2. But if, on the other hand, he yield to his inclination, immediately he is weighed down by the condemnation of his conscience; for that he hath followed his own desire, and yet in no way attained the peace which he hoped for.  For true peace of heart is to be found in resisting passion, not in yielding to it. And therefore there is no peace in the heart of a man who is carnal, nor in him who is given up to the things that are without him, but only in him who is fervent towards God and living the life of the Spirit. CHAPTER VII Of fleeing from vain hope and pride Vain is the life of that man who putteth his trust in men or in any created Thing.  Be not ashamed to be the servant of others for the love of Jesus Christ, and to be reckoned poor in this life.  Rest not upon thyself, but build thy hope in God.  Do what lieth in thy power, and God will help thy good intent. Trust not in thy learning, nor in the cleverness of any that lives, but rather trust in the favour of God, who resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble. 2. Boast not thyself in thy riches if thou hast them, nor in thy friends if they be powerful, but in God, who giveth all things, and in addition to all things desireth to give even Himself.  Be not lifted up because of thy strength or beauty of body, for with only a slight sickness it will fail and wither away.  Be not vain of thy skilfulness or ability, lest thou displease God, from whom cometh every good gift which we have. 3. Count not thyself better than others, lest perchance thou appear worse in the sight of God, who knoweth what is in man.  Be not proud of thy good works, for God's judgments are of another sort than the judgments of man, and what pleaseth man is ofttimes displeasing to Him.  If thou hast any good, believe that others have more, and so thou mayest preserve thy humility. It is no harm to thee if thou place thyself below all others; but it is great harm if thou place thyself above even one.  Peace is ever with the humble man, but in the heart of the proud there is envy and continual wrath. CHAPTER VIII Of the danger of too much familiarity Open not thine heart to every man, but deal with one who is wise and feareth God. Be seldom with the young and with strangers.  Be not a flatterer of the rich; nor willingly seek the society of the great.  Let thy company be the humble and the simple, the devout and the gentle, and let thy discourse be concerning things which edify.  Be not familiar with any woman, but commend all good women alike unto God.  Choose for thy companions God and His Angels only, and flee from the notice of men. 2. We must love all men, but not make close companions of all. It sometimes falleth out that one who is unknown to us is highly regarded through good report of him, whose actual person is nevertheless unpleasing to those who behold it.  We sometimes think to please others by our intimacy, and forthwith displease them the more by the faultiness of character which they perceive in us. CHAPTER IX Of obedience and subjection It is verily a great thing to live in obedience, to be under authority, and not to be at our own disposal.  Far safer is it to live in subjection than in a place of authority.  Many are in obedience from necessity rather than from love; these take it amiss, and repine for small cause.  Nor will they gain freedom of spirit, unless with all their heart they submit themselves for the love of God.  Though thou run hither and thither, thou wilt not find peace, save in humble subjection to the authority of him who is set over thee.  Fancies about places and change of them have deceived many. 2. True it is that every man willingly followeth his own bent, and is the more inclined to those who agree with him.  But if Christ is amongst us, then it is necessary that we sometimes yield up our own opinion for the sake of peace.  Who is so wise as to have perfect knowledge of all things?  Therefore trust not too much to thine own opinion, but be ready also to hear the opinions of others.  Though thine own opinion be good, yet if for the love of God thou foregoest it, and followest that of another, thou shalt the more profit thereby. 3. Ofttimes I have heard that it is safer to hearken and to receive counsel than to give it.  It may also come to pass that each opinion may be good; but to refuse to hearken to others when reason or occasion requireth it, is a mark of pride or wilfulness. CHAPTER X Of the danger of superfluity of words Avoid as far as thou canst the tumult of men; for talk concerning worldly things, though it be innocently undertaken, is a hindrance, so quickly are we led captive and defiled by vanity. Many a time I wish that I had held my peace, and had not gone amongst men.  But why do we talk and gossip so continually, seeing that we so rarely resume our silence without some hurt done to our conscience?  We like talking so much because we hope by our conversations to gain some mutual comfort, and because we seek to refresh our wearied spirits by variety of thoughts.  And we very willingly talk and think of those things which we love or desire, or else of those which we most dislike. 2. But alas! it is often to no purpose and in vain.  For this outward consolation is no small hindrance to the inner comfort which cometh from God.  Therefore must we watch and pray that time pass not idly away.  If it be right and desirable for thee to speak, speak things which are to edification.  Evil custom and neglect of our real profit tend much to make us heedless of watching over our lips.  Nevertheless, devout conversation on spiritual things helpeth not a little to spiritual progress, most of all where those of kindred mind and spirit find their ground of fellowship in God. CHAPTER XI Of seeking peace of mind and of spiritual progress We may enjoy abundance of peace if we refrain from busying ourselves with the sayings and doings of others, and things which concern not ourselves.  How can he abide long time in peace who occupieth himself with other men's matters, and with things without himself, and meanwhile payeth little or rare heed to the self within?  Blessed are the single-hearted, for they shall have abundance of peace. 2. How came it to pass that many of the Saints were so perfect, so contemplative of Divine things?  Because they steadfastly sought to mortify themselves from all worldly desires, and so were enabled to cling with their whole heart to God, and be free and at leisure for the thought of Him.  We are too much occupied with our own affections, and too anxious about transitory things. Seldom, too, do we entirely conquer even a single fault, nor are we zealous for daily growth in grace.  And so we remain lukewarm and unspiritual. 3. Were we fully watchful of ourselves, and not bound in spirit to outward things, then might we be wise unto salvation, and make progress in Divine contemplation.  Our great and grievous stumbling-block is that, not being freed from our affections and desires, we strive not to enter into the perfect way of the Saints.  And when even a little trouble befalleth us, too quickly are we cast down, and fly to the world to give us comfort. 4. If we would quit ourselves like men, and strive to stand firm in the battle, then should we see the Lord helping us from Heaven. For He Himself is alway ready to help those who strive and who trust in Him; yea, He provideth for us occasions of striving, to the end that we may win the victory.  If we look upon our progress in religion as a progress only in outward observances and forms, our devoutness will soon come to an end.  But let us lay the axe to the very root of our life, that, being cleansed from affections, we may possess our souls in peace. 5. If each year should see one fault rooted out from us, we should go quickly on to perfection.  But on the contrary, we often feel that we were better and holier in the beginning of our conversion than after many years of profession.  Zeal and progress ought to increase day by day; yet now it seemeth a great thing if one is able to retain some portion of his first ardour. If we would put some slight stress on ourselves at the beginning, then afterwards we should be able to do all things with ease and joy. 6. It is a hard thing to break through a habit, and a yet harder thing to go contrary to our own will.  Yet if thou overcome not slight and easy obstacles, how shalt thou overcome greater ones? Withstand thy will at the beginning, and unlearn an evil habit, lest it lead thee little by little into worse difficulties.  Oh, if thou knewest what peace to thyself thy holy life should bring to thyself, and what joy to others, methinketh thou wouldst be more zealous for spiritual profit. CHAPTER XII Of the uses of adversity It is good for us that we sometimes have sorrows and adversities, for they often make a man lay to heart that he is only a stranger and sojourner, and may not put his trust in any worldly thing. It is good that we sometimes endure contradictions, and are hardly and unfairly judged, when we do and mean what is good. For these things help us to be humble, and shield us from vain-glory.  For then we seek the more earnestly the witness of God, when men speak evil of us falsely, and give us no credit for good. 2. Therefore ought a man to rest wholly upon God, so that he needeth not seek much comfort at the hand of men.  When a man who feareth God is afflicted or tried or oppressed with evil thoughts, then he seeth that God is the more necessary unto him, since without God he can do no good thing.  Then he is heavy of heart, he groaneth, he crieth out for the very disquietness of his heart.  Then he groweth weary of life, and would fain depart and be with Christ.  By all this he is taught that in the world there can be no perfect security or fulness of peace. CHAPTER XIII Of resisting temptation So long as we live in the world, we cannot be without trouble and trial.  Wherefore it is written in Job, The life of man upon the earth is a trial.(1)  And therefore ought each of us to give heed concerning trials and temptations, and watch unto prayer, lest the devil find occasion to deceive; for he never sleepeth, but goeth about seeking whom he may devour.  No man is so perfect in holiness that he hath never temptations, nor can we ever be wholly free from them. 2. Yet, notwithstanding, temptations turn greatly unto our profit, even though they be great and hard to bear; for through them we are humbled, purified, instructed.  All Saints have passed through much tribulation and temptation, and have profited thereby.  And they who endured not temptation became reprobate and fell away.  There is no position so sacred, no place so secret, that it is without temptations and adversities. 3. There is no man wholly free from temptations so long as he liveth, because we have the root of temptation within ourselves, in that we are born in concupiscence.  One temptation or sorrow passeth, and another cometh; and always we shall have somewhat to suffer, for we have fallen from perfect happiness. Many who seek to fly from temptations fall yet more deeply into them. By flight alone we cannot overcome, but by endurance and true humility we are made stronger than all our enemies. 4. He who only resisteth outwardly and pulleth not up by the root, shall profit little; nay, rather temptations will return to him the more quickly, and will be the more terrible.  Little by little, through patience and longsuffering, thou shalt conquer by the help of God, rather than by violence and thine own strength of will.  In the midst of temptation often seek counsel; and deal not hardly with one who is tempted, but comfort and strengthen him as thou wouldest have done unto thyself. 5. The beginning of all temptations to evil is instability of temper and want of trust in God; for even as a ship without a helm is tossed about by the waves, so is a man who is careless and infirm of purpose tempted, now on this side, now on that. As fire testeth iron, so doth temptation the upright man. Oftentimes we know not what strength we have; but temptation revealeth to us what we are.  Nevertheless, we must watch, especially in the beginnings of temptation; for then is the foe the more easily mastered, when he is not suffered to enter within the mind, but is met outside the door as soon as he hath knocked. Wherefore one saith,    Check the beginnings; once thou might'st have cured,    But now 'tis past thy skill, too long hath it endured. For first cometh to the mind the simple suggestion, then the strong imagination, afterwards pleasure, evil affection, assent. And so little by little the enemy entereth in altogether, because he was not resisted at the beginning.  And the longer a man delayeth his resistance, the weaker he groweth, and the stronger groweth the enemy against him. 6. Some men suffer their most grievous temptations in the beginning of their conversion, some at the end.  Some are sorely tried their whole life long.  Some there are who are tempted but lightly, according to the wisdom and justice of the ordering of God, who knoweth the character and circumstances of men, and ordereth all things for the welfare of His elect. 7. Therefore we ought not to despair when we are tempted, but the more fervently should cry unto God, that He will vouchsafe to help us in all our tribulation; and that He will, as St. Paul saith, with the temptation make a way to escape that we may be able to bear it.(2)  Let us therefore humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God in all temptation and trouble, for He will save and exalt such as are of an humble spirit. 8. In temptations and troubles a man is proved, what progress he hath made, and therein is his reward the greater, and his virtue doth the more appear.  Nor is it a great thing if a man be devout and zealous so long as he suffereth no affliction; but if he behave himself patiently in the time of adversity, then is there hope of great progress.  Some are kept safe from great temptations, but are overtaken in those which are little and common, that the humiliation may teach them not to trust to themselves in great things, being weak in small things. (1) Job vii. 1 (Vulg.).   (2) 1 Corinthians x. 13. CHAPTER XIV On avoiding rash judgment Look well unto thyself, and beware that thou judge not the doings of others.  In judging others a man laboureth in vain; he often erreth, and easily falleth into sin; but in judging and examining himself he always laboureth to good purpose.  According as a matter toucheth our fancy, so oftentimes do we judge of it; for easily do we fail of true judgment because of our own personal feeling.  If God were always the sole object of our desire, we should the less easily be troubled by the erring judgment of our fancy. 2. But often some secret thought lurking within us, or even some outward circumstance, turneth us aside.  Many are secretly seeking their own ends in what they do, yet know it not.  They seem to live in good peace of mind so long as things go well with them, and according to their desires, but if their desires be frustrated and broken, immediately they are shaken and displeased.  Diversity of feelings and opinions very often brings about dissensions between friends, between countrymen, between religious and godly men. 3. Established custom is not easily relinquished, and no man is very easily led to see with the eyes of another.  If thou rest more upon thy own reason or experience than upon the power of Jesus Christ, thy light shall come slowly and hardly; for God willeth us to be perfectly subject unto Himself, and all our reason to be exalted by abundant love towards Him. CHAPTER XV Of works of charity For no worldly good whatsoever, and for the love of no man, must anything be done which is evil, but for the help of the suffering a good work must sometimes be postponed, or be changed for a better; for herein a good work is not destroyed, but improved. Without charity no work profiteth, but whatsoever is done in charity, however small and of no reputation it be, bringeth forth good fruit; for God verily considereth what a man is able to do, more than the greatness of what he doth. 2. He doth much who loveth much.  He doth much who doth well.  He doth well who ministereth to the public good rather than to his own.  Oftentimes that seemeth to be charity which is rather carnality, because it springeth from natural inclination, self-will, hope of repayment, desire of gain. 3. He who hath true and perfect charity, in no wise seeketh his own good, but desireth that God alone be altogether glorified. He envieth none, because he longeth for no selfish joy; nor doth he desire to rejoice in himself, but longeth to be blessed in God as the highest good.  He ascribeth good to none save to God only, the Fountain whence all good proceedeth, and the End, the Peace, the joy of all Saints.  Oh, he who hath but a spark of true charity, hath verily learned that all worldly things are full of vanity. CHAPTER XVI Of bearing with the faults of others Those things which a man cannot amend in himself or in others, he ought patiently to bear, until God shall otherwise ordain. Bethink thee that perhaps it is better for thy trial and patience, without which our merits are but little worth. Nevertheless thou oughtest, when thou findeth such impediments, to beseech God that He would vouchsafe to sustain thee, that thou be able to bear them with a good will. 2. If one who is once or twice admonished refuse to hearken, strive not with him, but commit all to God, that His will may be done and His honour be shown in His servants, for He knoweth well how to convert the evil unto good.  Endeavour to be patient in bearing with other men's faults and infirmities whatsoever they be, for thou thyself also hast many things which have need to be borne with by others.  If thou canst not make thine own self what thou desireth, how shalt thou be able to fashion another to thine own liking.  We are ready to see others made perfect, and yet we do not amend our own shortcomings. 3. We will that others be straitly corrected, but we will not be corrected ourselves.  The freedom of others displeaseth us, but we are dissatisfied that our own wishes shall be denied us.  We desire rules to be made restraining others, but by no means will we suffer ourselves to be restrained.  Thus therefore doth it plainly appear how seldom we weigh our neighbour in the same balance with ourselves. If all men were perfect, what then should we have to suffer from others for God? 4. But now hath God thus ordained, that we may learn to bear one another's burdens, because none is without defect, none without a burden, none sufficient of himself, none wise enough of himself; but it behoveth us to bear with one another, to comfort one another, to help, instruct, admonish one another.  How much strength each man hath is best proved by occasions of adversity: for such occasions do not make a man frail, but show of what temper he is. CHAPTER XVII Of a religious life It behoveth thee to learn to mortify thyself in many things, if thou wilt live in amity and concord with other men.  It is no small thing to dwell in a religious community or congregation, and to live there without complaint, and therein to remain faithful even unto death.  Blessed is he who hath lived a good life in such a body, and brought it to a happy end.  If thou wilt stand fast and wilt profit as thou oughtest, hold thyself as an exile and a pilgrim upon the earth.  Thou wilt have to be counted as a fool for Christ, if thou wilt lead a religious life. 2. The clothing and outward appearance are of small account; it is change of character and entire mortification of the affections which make a truly religious man.  He who seeketh aught save God and the health of his soul, shall find only tribulation and sorrow.  Nor can he stand long in peace, who striveth not to be least of all and servant of all. 3. Thou art called to endure and to labour, not to a life of ease and trifling talk.  Here therefore are men tried as gold in the furnace.  No man can stand, unless with all his heart he will humble himself for God's sake. CHAPTER XVIII Of the example of the Holy Fathers Consider now the lively examples of the holy fathers, in whom shone forth real perfectness and religion, and thou shalt see how little, even as nothing, is all that we do.  Ah! What is our life when compared to theirs?  They, saints and friends of Christ as they were, served the Lord in hunger and thirst, in cold and nakedness, in labour and weariness, in watchings and fastings, in prayer and holy meditations, in persecutions and much rebuke. 2. O how many and grievous tribulations did the Apostles, Martyrs, Confessors, Virgins, endure; and all others who would walk in the footsteps of Christ. For they hated their souls in this world that they might keep them unto life eternal.  O how strict and retired a life was that of the holy fathers who dwelt in the desert!  what long and grievous temptations they did suffer!  how often were they assaulted by the enemy!  what frequent and fervid prayers did they offer unto God!  what strict fasts did they endure!  what fervent zeal and desire after spiritual profit did they manifest!  how bravely did they fight that their vices might not gain the mastery!  how entirely and steadfastly did they reach after God!  By day they laboured, and at night they gave themselves ofttimes unto prayer; yea, even when they were labouring they ceased not from mental prayer. 3. They spent their whole time profitably; every hour seemed short for retirement with God; and through the great sweetness of contemplation, even the need of bodily refreshment was forgotten. They renounced all riches, dignities, honours, friends, kinsmen; they desired nothing from the world; they ate the bare necessaries of life; they were unwilling to minister to the body even in necessity.  Thus were they poor in earthly things, but rich above measure in grace and virtue.  Though poor to the outer eye, within they were filled with grace and heavenly benedictions. 4. They were strangers to the world, but unto God they were as kinsmen and friends.  They seemed unto themselves as of no reputation, and in the world's eyes contemptible; but in the sight of God they were precious and beloved.  They stood fast in true humility, they lived in simple obedience, they walked in love and patience; and thus they waxed strong in spirit, and obtained great favour before God.  To all religious men they were given as an example, and they ought more to provoke us unto good livings than the number of the lukewarm tempteth to carelessness of life. 5. O how great was the love of all religious persons at the beginning of this sacred institution!  O what devoutness of prayer!  what rivalry in holiness!  what strict discipline was observed!  what reverence and obedience under the rule of the master showed they in all things!  The traces of them that remain until now testify that they were truly holy and perfect men, who fighting so bravely trod the world underfoot.  Now a man is counted great if only he be not a transgressor, and if he can only endure with patience what he hath undertaken. 6. O the coldness and negligence of our times, that we so quickly decline from the former love, and it is become a weariness to live, because of sloth and lukewarmness.  May progress in holiness not wholly fall asleep in thee, who many times hast seen so many examples of devout men! CHAPTER XIX Of the exercises of a religious man The life of a Christian ought to be adorned with all virtues, that he may be inwardly what he outwardly appeareth unto men. And verily it should be yet better within than without, for God is a discerner of our heart, Whom we must reverence with all our hearts wheresoever we are, and walk pure in His presence as do the angels.  We ought daily to renew our vows, and to kindle our hearts to zeal, as if each day were the first day of our conversion, and to say, "Help me, O God, in my good resolutions, and in Thy holy service, and grant that this day I may make a good beginning, for hitherto I have done nothing!" 2. According to our resolution so is the rate of our progress, and much diligence is needful for him who would make good progress.  For if he who resolveth bravely oftentimes falleth short, how shall it be with him who resolveth rarely or feebly? But manifold causes bring about abandonment of our resolution, yet a trivial omission of holy exercises can hardly be made without some loss to us.  The resolution of the righteous dependeth more upon the grace of God than upon their own wisdom; for in Him they always put their trust, whatsoever they take in hand.  For man proposeth, but God disposeth; and the way of a man is not in himself.(1) 3. If a holy exercise be sometimes omitted for the sake of some act of piety, or of some brotherly kindness, it can easily be taken up afterwards; but if it be neglected through distaste or slothfulness, then is it sinful, and the mischief will be felt. Strive as earnestly as we may, we shall still fall short in many things.  Always should some distinct resolution be made by us; and, most of all, we must strive against those sins which most easily beset us.  Both our outer and inner life should be straitly examined and ruled by us, because both have to do with our progress. 4. If thou canst not be always examining thyself, thou canst at certain seasons, and at least twice in the day, at evening and at morning.  In the morning make thy resolves, and in the evening inquire into thy life, how thou hast sped to-day in word, deed, and thought; for in these ways thou hast often perchance offended God and thy neighbour.  Gird up thy lions like a man against the assaults of the devil; bridle thine appetite, and thou wilt soon be able to bridle every inclination of the flesh.  Be thou never without something to do; be reading, or writing, or praying, or meditating, or doing something that is useful to the community. Bodily exercises, however, must be undertaken with discretion, nor are they to be used by all alike. 5. The duties which are not common to all must not be done openly, but are safest carried on in secret.  But take heed that thou be not careless in the common duties, and more devout in the secret; but faithfully and honestly discharge the duties and commands which lie upon thee, then afterwards, if thou hast still leisure, give thyself to thyself as thy devotion leadeth thee. All cannot have one exercise, but one suiteth better to this man and another to that.  Even for the diversity of season different exercises are needed, some suit better for feasts, some for fasts.  We need one kind in time of temptations and others in time of peace and quietness. Some are suitable to our times of sadness, and others when we are joyful in the Lord. 6. When we draw near the time of the great feasts, good exercises should be renewed, and the prayers of holy men more fervently besought.  We ought to make our resolutions from one Feast to another, as if each were the period of our departure from this world, and of entering into the eternal feast.  So ought we to prepare ourselves earnestly at solemn seasons, and the more solemnly to live, and to keep straightest watch upon each holy observance, as though we were soon to receive the reward of our labours at the hand of God. 7. And if this be deferred, let us believe ourselves to be as yet ill-prepared, and unworthy as yet of the glory which shall be revealed in us at the appointed season; and let us study to prepare ourselves the better for our end.  Blessed is that servant, as the Evangelist Luke hath it, whom, when the Lord cometh He shall find watching.  Verily I say unto you He will make him ruler over all that He hath.(2) (1) Jeremiah x. 23.   (2) Luke xii. 43, 44. CHAPTER XX Of the love of solitude and silence Seek a suitable time for thy meditation, and think frequently of the mercies of God to thee.  Leave curious questions.  Study such matters as bring thee sorrow for sin rather than amusement.  If thou withdraw thyself from trifling conversation and idle goings about, as well as from novelties and gossip, thou shalt find thy time sufficient and apt for good meditation.  The greatest saints used to avoid as far as they could the company of men, and chose to live in secret with God. 2. One hath said, "As oft as I have gone among men, so oft have I returned less a man."  This is what we often experience when we have been long time in conversation.  For it is easier to be altogether silent than it is not to exceed in word.  It is easier to remain hidden at home than to keep sufficient guard upon thyself out of doors.  He, therefore, that seeketh to reach that which is hidden and spiritual, must go with Jesus "apart from the multitude."  No man safely goeth abroad who loveth not to rest at home.  No man safely talketh but he who loveth to hold his peace. No man safely ruleth but he who loveth to be subject.  No man safely commandeth but he who loveth to obey. 3. No man safely rejoiceth but he who hath the testimony of a good conscience within himself.  The boldness of the Saints was always full of the fear of God.  Nor were they the less earnest and humble in themselves, because they shone forth with great virtues and grace.  But the boldness of wicked men springeth from pride and presumption, and at the last turneth to their own confusion.  Never promise thyself security in this life, howsoever good a monk or devout a solitary thou seemest. 4. Often those who stand highest in the esteem of men, fall the more grievously because of their over great confidence. Wherefore it is very profitable unto many that they should not be without inward temptation, but should be frequently assaulted, lest they be over confident, lest they be indeed lifted up into pride, or else lean too freely upon the consolations of the world.  O how good a conscience should that man keep, who never sought a joy that passeth away, who never became entangled with the world!  O how great peace and quiet should he possess, who would cast off all vain care, and think only of healthful and divine things, and build his whole hope upon God! 5. No man is worthy of heavenly consolation but he who hath diligently exercised himself in holy compunction.  If thou wilt feel compunction within thy heart, enter into thy chamber and shut out the tumults of the world, as it is written, Commune with your own heart in your own chamber and be still.(1)  In retirement thou shalt find what often thou wilt lose abroad. Retirement, if thou continue therein, groweth sweet, but if thou keep not in it, begetteth weariness.  If in the beginning of thy conversation thou dwell in it and keep it well, it shall afterwards be to thee a dear friend, and a most pleasant solace. 6. In silence and quiet the devout soul goeth forward and learneth the hidden things of the Scriptures.  Therein findeth she a fountain of tears, wherein to wash and cleanse herself each night, that she may grow the more dear to her Maker as she dwelleth the further from all worldly distraction.  To him who withdraweth himself from his acquaintance and friends God with his holy angels will draw nigh.  It is better to be unknown and take heed to oneself than to neglect oneself and work wonders. It is praiseworthy for a religious man to go seldom abroad, to fly from being seen, to have no desire to see men. 7. Why wouldest thou see what thou mayest not have?  The world passeth away and the lust thereof.  The desires of sensuality draw thee abroad, but when an hour is past, what dost thou bring home, but a weight upon thy conscience and distraction of heart? A merry going forth bringeth often a sorrowful return, and a merry evening maketh a sad morning?  So doth all carnal joy begin pleasantly, but in the end it gnaweth away and destroyeth. What canst thou see abroad which thou seest not at home?  Behold the heaven and the earth and the elements, for out of these are all things made. 8. What canst thou see anywhere which can continue long under the sun?  Thou believest perchance that thou shalt be satisfied, but thou wilt never be able to attain unto this.  If thou shouldest see all things before thee at once, what would it be but a vain vision?  Lift up thine eyes to God on high, and pray that thy sins and negligences may be forgiven.  Leave vain things to vain men, and mind thou the things which God hath commanded thee. Shut thy door upon thee, and call unto thyself Jesus thy beloved. Remain with Him in thy chamber, for thou shalt not elsewhere find so great peace.  If thou hadst not gone forth nor listened to vain talk, thou hadst better kept thyself in good peace.  But because it sometimes delighteth thee to hear new things, thou must therefore suffer trouble of heart. (1) Psalm iv. 4. CHAPTER XXI Of compunction of heart If thou wilt make any progress keep thyself in the fear of God, and long not to be too free, but restrain all thy senses under discipline and give not thyself up to senseless mirth.  Give thyself to compunction of heart and thou shalt find devotion. Compunction openeth the way for many good things, which dissoluteness is wont quickly to lose.  It is wonderful that any man can ever rejoice heartily in this life who considereth and weigheth his banishment, and the manifold dangers which beset his soul. 2. Through lightness of heart and neglect of our shortcomings we feel not the sorrows of our soul, but often vainly laugh when we have good cause to weep.  There is no true liberty nor real joy, save in the fear of God with a good conscience.  Happy is he who can cast away every cause of distraction and bring himself to the one purpose of holy compunction.  Happy is he who putteth away from him whatsoever may stain or burden his conscience.  Strive manfully; custom is overcome by custom.  If thou knowest how to let men alone, they will gladly let thee alone to do thine own works. 3. Busy not thyself with the affairs of others, nor entangle thyself with the business of great men.  Keep always thine eye upon thyself first of all, and give advice to thyself specially before all thy dearest friends.  If thou hast not the favour of men, be not thereby cast down, but let thy concern be that thou holdest not thyself so well and circumspectly, as becometh a servant of God and a devout monk.  It is often better and safer for a man not to have many comforts in this life, especially those which concern the flesh.  But that we lack divine comforts or feel them rarely is to our own blame, because we seek not compunction of heart, nor utterly cast away those comforts which are vain and worldly. 4. Know thyself to be unworthy of divine consolation, and worthy rather of much tribulation.  When a man hath perfect compunction, then all the world is burdensome and bitter to him.  A good man will find sufficient cause for mourning and weeping; for whether he considereth himself, or pondereth concerning his neighbour, he knoweth that no man liveth here without tribulation, and the more thoroughly he considereth himself, the more thoroughly he grieveth. Grounds for just grief and inward compunction there are in our sins and vices, wherein we lie so entangled that we are but seldom able to contemplate heavenly things. 5. If thou thoughtest upon thy death more often than how long thy life should be, thou wouldest doubtless strive more earnestly to improve.  And if thou didst seriously consider the future pains of hell, I believe thou wouldest willingly endure toil or pain and fear not discipline.  But because these things reach not the heart, and we still love pleasant things, therefore we remain cold and miserably indifferent. 6. Oftentimes it is from poverty of spirit that the wretched body is so easily led to complain.  Pray therefore humbly unto the Lord that He will give thee the spirit of compunction and say in the language of the prophet, Feed me, O Lord, with bread of tears, and give me plenteousness of tears to drink.(1) (1) Psalm lxxv. 5. CHAPTER XXII On the contemplation of human misery Thou art miserable wheresoever thou art, and whithersoever thou turnest, unless thou turn thee to God.  Why art thou disquieted because it happeneth not to thee according to thy wishes and desires?  Who is he that hath everything according to his will? Neither I, nor thou, nor any man upon the earth.  There is no man in the world free from trouble or anguish, though he were King or Pope.  Who is he who hath the happiest lot?  Even he who is strong to suffer somewhat for God. 2. There are many foolish and unstable men who say, "See what a prosperous life that man hath, how rich and how great he is, how powerful, how exalted."  But lift up thine eyes to the good things of heaven, and thou shalt see that all these worldly things are nothing, they are utterly uncertain, yea, they are wearisome, because they are never possessed without care and fear.  The happiness of man lieth not in the abundance of temporal things but a moderate portion sufficeth him.  Our life upon the earth is verily wretchedness.  The more a man desireth to be spiritual, the more bitter doth the present life become to him; because he the better understandeth and seeth the defects of human corruption.  For to eat, to drink, to watch, to sleep, to rest, to labour, and to be subject to the other necessities of nature, is truly a great wretchedness and affliction to a devout man, who would fain be released and free from all sin. 3. For the inner man is heavily burdened with the necessities of the body in this world.  Wherefore the prophet devoutly prayeth to be freed from them, saying, Deliver me from my necessities, O Lord.(1)  But woe to those who know not their own misery, and yet greater woe to those who love this miserable and corruptible life.  For to such a degree do some cling to it (even though by labouring or begging they scarce procure what is necessary for subsistence) that if they might live here always, they would care nothing for the Kingdom of God. 4. Oh foolish and faithless of heart, who lie buried so deep in worldly things, that they relish nothing save the things of the flesh!  Miserable ones!  they will too sadly find out at the last, how vile and worthless was that which they loved.  The saints of God and all loyal friends of Christ held as nothing the things which pleased the flesh, or those which flourished in this life, but their whole hope and affection aspired to the things which are above.  Their whole desire was borne upwards to everlasting and invisible things, lest they should be drawn downwards by the love of things visible. 5. Lose not, brother, thy loyal desire of progress to things spiritual.  There is yet time, the hour is not past.  Why wilt thou put off thy resolution?  Arise, begin this very moment, and say, "Now is the time to do: now is the time to fight, now is the proper time for amendment."  When thou art ill at ease and troubled, then is the time when thou art nearest unto blessing. Thou must go through fire and water that God may bring thee into a wealthy place.  Unless thou put force upon thyself, thou wilt not conquer thy faults.  So long as we carry about with us this frail body, we cannot be without sin, we cannot live without weariness and trouble.  Gladly would we have rest from all misery; but because through sin we have lost innocence, we have lost also the true happiness.  Therefore must we be patient, and wait for the mercy of God, until this tyranny be overpast, and this mortality be swallowed up of life. 6. O how great is the frailty of man, which is ever prone to evil!  To-day thou confessest thy sins, and to-morrow thou committest again the sins thou didst confess.  Now dost thou resolve to avoid a fault, and within an hour thou behavest thyself as if thou hadst never resolved at all.  Good cause have we therefore to humble ourselves, and never to think highly of ourselves, seeing that we are so frail and unstable.  And quickly may that be lost by our negligence, which by much labour was hardly attained through grace. 7. What shall become of us at the end, if at the beginning we are lukewarm and idle?  Woe unto us, if we choose to rest, as though it were a time of peace and security, while as yet no sign appeareth in our life of true holiness.  Rather had we need that we might begin yet afresh, like good novices, to be instructed unto good living, if haply there might be hope of some future amendment and greater spiritual increase. (1) Psalm xxv. 17. CHAPTER XXIII Of meditation upon death Very quickly will there be an end of thee here; take heed therefore how it will be with thee in another world.  To-day man is, and to-morrow he will be seen no more.  And being removed out of sight, quickly also he is out of mind.  O the dulness and hardness of man's heart, which thinketh only of the present, and looketh not forward to the future.  Thou oughtest in every deed and thought so to order thyself, as if thou wert to die this day. If thou hadst a good conscience thou wouldst not greatly fear death.  It were better for thee to watch against sin, than to fly from death.  If to-day thou art not ready, how shalt thou be ready to-morrow?  To-morrow is an uncertain day; and how knowest thou that thou shalt have a to-morrow? 2. What doth it profit to live long, when we amend so little? Ah!  long life doth not always amend, but often the more increaseth guilt.  Oh that we might spend a single day in this world as it ought to be spent!  Many there are who reckon the years since they were converted, and yet oftentimes how little is the fruit thereof.  If it is a fearful thing to die, it may be perchance a yet more fearful thing to live long.  Happy is the man who hath the hour of his death always before his eyes, and daily prepareth himself to die.  If thou hast ever seen one die, consider that thou also shalt pass away by the same road. 3. When it is morning reflect that it may be thou shalt not see the evening, and at eventide dare not to boast thyself of the morrow.  Always be thou prepared, and so live that death may never find thee unprepared.  Many die suddenly and unexpectedly. For at such an hour as ye think not, the Son of Man cometh.(1) When that last hour shall come, thou wilt begin to think very differently of thy whole life past, and wilt mourn bitterly that thou hast been so negligent and slothful. 4. Happy and wise is he who now striveth to be such in life as he would fain be found in death!  For a perfect contempt of the world, a fervent desire to excel in virtue, the love of discipline, the painfulness of repentance, readiness to obey, denial of self, submission to any adversity for love of Christ; these are the things which shall give great confidence of a happy death.  Whilst thou art in health thou hast many opportunities of good works; but when thou art in sickness I know not how much thou wilt be able to do.  Few are made better by infirmity: even as they who wander much abroad seldom become holy. 5. Trust not thy friends and kinsfolk, nor put off the work of thy salvation to the future, for men will forget thee sooner than thou thinkest.  It is better for thee now to provide in time, and to send some good before thee, than to trust to the help of others.  If thou art not anxious for thyself now, who, thinkest thou, will be anxious for thee afterwards?  Now the time is most precious.  Now is the accepted time, now is the day of salvation. But alas!  that thou spendest not well this time, wherein thou mightest lay up treasure which should profit thee everlastingly. The hour will come when thou shalt desire one day, yea, one hour, for amendment of life, and I know not whether thou shalt obtain. 6. Oh, dearly beloved, from what danger thou mightest free thyself, from what great fear, if only thou wouldst always live in fear, and in expectation of death!  Strive now to live in such wise that in the hour of death thou mayest rather rejoice than fear.  Learn now to die to the world, so shalt thou begin to live with Christ.  Learn now to contemn all earthly things, and then mayest thou freely go unto Christ.  Keep under thy body by penitence, and then shalt thou be able to have a sure confidence. 7. Ah, foolish one!  why thinkest thou that thou shalt live long, when thou art not sure of a single day?  How many have been deceived, and suddenly have been snatched away from the body! How many times hast thou heard how one was slain by the sword, another was drowned, another falling from on high broke his neck, another died at the table, another whilst at play! One died by fire, another by the sword, another by the pestilence, another by the robber.  Thus cometh death to all, and the life of men swiftly passeth away like a shadow. 8. Who will remember thee after thy death?  And who will entreat for thee?  Work, work now, oh dearly beloved, work all that thou canst.  For thou knowest not when thou shalt die, nor what shall happen unto thee after death.  While thou hast time, lay up for thyself undying riches.  Think of nought but of thy salvation; care only for the things of God.  Make to thyself friends, by venerating the saints of God and walking in their steps, that when thou failest, thou mayest be received into everlasting habitations.(2) 9. Keep thyself as a stranger and a pilgrim upon the earth, to whom the things of the world appertain not.  Keep thine heart free, and lifted up towards God, for here have we no continuing city.(3)  To Him direct thy daily prayers with crying and tears, that thy spirit may be found worthy to pass happily after death unto its Lord.  Amen. (1) Matthew xxiv. 44.   (2) Luke xvi. 9.   (3) Hebrews xiii. 14. CHAPTER XXIV Of the judgment and punishment of the wicked In all that thou doest, remember the end, and how thou wilt stand before a strict judge, from whom nothing is hid, who is not bribed with gifts, nor accepteth excuses, but will judge righteous judgment.  O most miserable and foolish sinner, who art sometimes in fear of the countenance of an angry man, what wilt thou answer to God, who knoweth all thy misdeeds?  Why dost thou not provide for thyself against the day of judgment, when no man shall be able to be excused or defended by means of another, but each one shall bear his burden himself alone?  Now doth thy labour bring forth fruit, now is thy weeping acceptable, thy groaning heard, thy sorrow well pleasing to God, and cleansing to thy soul. 2. Even here on earth the patient man findeth great occasion of purifying his soul.  When suffering injuries he grieveth more for the other's malice than for his own wrong; when he prayeth heartily for those that despitefully use him, and forgiveth them from his heart; when he is not slow to ask pardon from others; when he is swifter to pity than to anger; when he frequently denieth himself and striveth altogether to subdue the flesh to the spirit.  Better is it now to purify the soul from sin, than to cling to sins from which we must be purged hereafter.  Truly we deceive ourselves by the inordinate love which we bear towards the flesh. 3. What is it which that fire shall devour, save thy sins?  The more thou sparest thyself and followest the flesh, the more heavy shall thy punishment be, and the more fuel art thou heaping up for the burning.  For wherein a man hath sinned, therein shall he be the more heavily punished.  There shall the slothful be pricked forward with burning goads, and the gluttons be tormented with intolerable hunger and thirst.  There shall the luxurious and the lovers of pleasure be plunged into burning pitch and stinking brimstone, and the envious shall howl like mad dogs for very grief. 4. No sin will there be which shall not be visited with its own proper punishment. The proud shall be filled with utter confusion, and the covetous shall be pinched with miserable poverty.  An hour's pain there shall be more grievous than a hundred years here of the bitterest penitence.  No quiet shall be there, no comfort for the lost, though here sometimes there is respite from pain, and enjoyment of the solace of friends.  Be thou anxious now and sorrowful for thy sins, that in the day of judgment thou mayest have boldness with the blessed.  For then shall the righteous man stand in great boldness before the face of such as have afflicted him and made no account of his labours.(1)  Then shall he stand up to judge, he who now submitteth himself in humility to the judgments of men.  Then shall the poor and humble man have great confidence, while the proud is taken with fear on every side. 5. Then shall it be seen that he was the wise man in this world who learned to be a fool and despised for Christ.  Then shall all tribulation patiently borne delight us, while the mouth of the ungodly shall be stopped.  Then shall every godly man rejoice, and every profane man shall mourn.  Then the afflicted flesh shall more rejoice than if it had been alway nourished in delights.  Then the humble garment shall put on beauty, and the precious robe shall hide itself as vile.  Then the little poor cottage shall be more commended than the gilded palace.  Then enduring patience shall have more might than all the power of the world.  Then simple obedience shall be more highly exalted than all worldly wisdom. 6. Then a pure and good conscience shall more rejoice than learned philosophy.  Then contempt of riches shall have more weight than all the treasure of the children of this world.  Then shalt thou find more comfort in having prayed devoutly than in having fared sumptuously.  Then thou wilt rather rejoice in having kept silence than in having made long speech.  Then holy deeds shall be far stronger than many fine words.  Then a strict life and sincere penitence shall bring deeper pleasure than all earthly delight.  Learn now to suffer a little, that then thou mayest be enabled to escape heavier sufferings.  Prove first here, what thou art able to endure hereafter.  If now thou art able to bear so little, how wilt thou be able to endure eternal torments?  If now a little suffering maketh thee so impatient, what shall hell-fire do then? Behold of a surety thou art not able to have two Paradises, to take thy fill or delight here in this world, and to reign with Christ hereafter. 7. If even unto this day thou hadst ever lived in honours and pleasures, what would the whole profit thee if now death came to thee in an instant?  All therefore is vanity, save to love God and to serve Him only.  For he who loveth God with all his heart feareth not death, nor punishment, nor judgment, nor hell, because perfect love giveth sure access to God.  But he who still delighteth in sin, no marvel if he is afraid of death and judgment.  Nevertheless it is a good thing, if love as yet cannot restrain thee from evil, that at least the fear of hell should hold thee back.  But he who putteth aside the fear of God cannot long continue in good, but shall quickly fall into the snares of the devil. (1) Wisd. v. 1. CHAPTER XXV Of the zealous amendment of our whole life Be thou watchful and diligent in God's service, and bethink thee often why thou hast renounced the world.  Was it not that thou mightest live to God and become a spiritual man?  Be zealous, therefore, for thy spiritual profit, for thou shalt receive shortly the reward of thy labours, and neither fear nor sorrow shall come any more into thy borders.  Now shalt thou labour a little, and thou shalt find great rest, yea everlasting joy.  If thou shalt remain faithful and zealous in labour, doubt not that God shall be faithful and bountiful in rewarding thee.  It is thy duty to have a good hope that thou wilt attain the victory, but thou must not fall into security lest thou become slothful or lifted up. 2. A certain man being in anxiety of mind, continually tossed about between hope and fear, and being on a certain day overwhelmed with grief, cast himself down in prayer before the altar in a church, and meditated within himself, saying, "Oh! if I but knew that I should still persevere," and presently heard within him a voice from God, "And if thou didst know it, what wouldst thou do?  Do now what thou wouldst do then, and thou shalt be very secure."  And straightway being comforted and strengthened, he committed himself to the will of God and the perturbation of spirit ceased, neither had he a mind any more to search curiously to know what should befall him hereafter, but studied rather to inquire what was the good and acceptable will of God, for the beginning and perfecting of every good work. 3. Hope in the Lord and be doing good, saith the Prophet; dwell in the land and thou shalt be fed(1) with its riches.  One thing there is which holdeth back many from progress and fervent amendment, even the dread of difficulty, or the labour of the conflict.  Nevertheless they advance above all others in virtue who strive manfully to conquer those things which are most grievous and contrary to them, for there a man profiteth most and meriteth greater grace where he most overcometh himself and mortifieth himself in spirit. 4. But all men have not the same passions to conquer and to mortify, yet he who is diligent shall attain more profit, although he have stronger passions, than another who is more temperate of disposition, but is withal less fervent in the pursuit of virtue.  Two things specially avail unto improvement in holiness, namely firmness to withdraw ourselves from the sin to which by nature we are most inclined, and earnest zeal for that good in which we are most lacking.  And strive also very earnestly to guard against and subdue those faults which displease thee most frequently in others. 5. Gather some profit to thy soul wherever thou art, and wherever thou seest or hearest good examples, stir thyself to follow them, but where thou seest anything which is blameworthy, take heed that thou do not the same; or if at any time thou hast done it, strive quickly to amend thyself.  As thine eye observeth others, so again are the eyes of others upon thee.  How sweet and pleasant is it to see zealous and godly brethren temperate and of good discipline; and how sad is it and grievous to see them walking disorderly, not practising the duties to which they are called. How hurtful a thing it is to neglect the purpose of their calling, and turn their inclinations to things which are none of their business. 6. Be mindful of the duties which thou hast undertaken, and set always before thee the remembrance of the Crucified.  Truly oughtest thou to be ashamed as thou lookest upon the life of Jesus Christ, because thou hast not yet endeavoured to conform thyself more unto Him, though thou hast been a long time in the way of God.  A religious man who exercises himself seriously and devoutly in the most holy life and passion of our Lord shall find there abundantly all things that are profitable and necessary for him, neither is there need that he shall seek anything better beyond Jesus.  Oh! if Jesus crucified would come into our hearts, how quickly, and completely should we have learned all that we need to know! 7. He who is earnest receiveth and beareth well all things that are laid upon him.  He who is careless and lukewarm hath trouble upon trouble, and suffereth anguish upon every side, because he is without inward consolation, and is forbidden to seek that which is outward.  He who is living without discipline is exposed to grievous ruin.  He who seeketh easier and lighter discipline shall always be in distress, because one thing or another will give him displeasure. 8. O! if no other duty lay upon us but to praise the Lord our God with our whole heart and voice!  Oh! if thou never hadst need to eat or drink, or sleep, but wert always able to praise God, and to give thyself to spiritual exercises alone; then shouldst thou be far happier than now, when for so many necessities thou must serve the flesh.  O! that these necessities were not, but only the spiritual refreshments of the soul, which alas we taste too seldom. 9. When a man hath come to this, that he seeketh comfort from no created thing, then doth he perfectly begin to enjoy God, then also will he be well contented with whatsoever shall happen unto him.  Then will he neither rejoice for much nor be sorrowful for little, but he committeth himself altogether and with full trust unto God, who is all in all to him, to whom nothing perisheth nor dieth, but all things live to Him and obey His every word without delay. 10. Remember always thine end, and how the time which is lost returneth not.  Without care and diligence thou shalt never get virtue.  If thou beginnest to grow cold, it shall begin to go ill with thee, but if thou givest thyself unto zeal thou shalt find much peace, and shalt find thy labour the lighter because of the grace of God and the love of virtue.  A zealous and diligent man is ready for all things.  It is greater labour to resist sins and passions than to toil in bodily labours.  He who shunneth not small faults falleth little by little into greater.  At eventide thou shalt always be glad if thou spend the day profitably. Watch over thyself, stir thyself up, admonish thyself, and howsoever it be with others, neglect not thyself. The more violence thou dost unto thyself, the more thou shall profit. Amen. (1) Psalm xxxvii. 3. THE SECOND BOOK ADMONITIONS CONCERNING THE INNER LIFE CHAPTER I Of the inward life The kingdom of God is within you,(1) saith the Lord.  Turn thee with all thine heart to the Lord and forsake this miserable world, and thou shalt find rest unto thy soul.  Learn to despise outward things and to give thyself to things inward, and thou shalt see the kingdom of God come within thee.  For the kingdom of God is peace and joy in the Holy Ghost, and it is not given to the wicked.  Christ will come to thee, and show thee His consolation, if thou prepare a worthy mansion for Him within thee.  All His glory and beauty is from within, and there it pleaseth Him to dwell.  He often visiteth the inward man and holdeth with him sweet discourse, giving him soothing consolation, much peace, friendship exceeding wonderful. 2. Go to, faithful soul, prepare thy heart for this bridegroom that he may vouchsafe to come to thee and dwell within thee, for so He saith, if any man loveth me he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him and make our abode with him.(2)  Give, therefore, place to Christ and refuse entrance to all others.  When thou hast Christ, thou art rich, and hast sufficient.  He shall be thy provider and faithful watchman in all things, so that thou hast no need to trust in men, for men soon change and swiftly pass away, but Christ remaineth for ever and standeth by us firmly even to the end. 3. There is no great trust to be placed in a frail and mortal man, even though he be useful and dear to us, neither should much sorrow arise within us if sometimes he oppose and contradict us.  They who are on thy side to-day, may to-morrow be against thee, and often are they turned round like the wind. Put thy whole trust in God and let Him be thy fear and thy love, He will answer for thee Himself, and will do for thee what is best.  Here hast thou no continuing city,(3)  and wheresoever thou art, thou art a stranger and a pilgrim, and thou shalt never have rest unless thou art closely united to Christ within thee. 4. Why dost thou cast thine eyes hither and thither, since this is not the place of thy rest?  In heaven ought thy habitation to be, and all earthly things should be looked upon as it were in the passing by.  All things pass away and thou equally with them. Look that thou cleave not to them lest thou be taken with them and perish.  Let thy contemplation be on the Most High, and let thy supplication be directed unto Christ without ceasing.  If thou canst not behold high and heavenly things, rest thou in the passion of Christ and dwell willingly in His sacred wounds.  For if thou devoutly fly to the wounds of Jesus, and the precious marks of the nails and the spear, thou shalt find great comfort in tribulation, nor will the slights of men trouble thee much, and thou wilt easily bear their unkind words. 5. Christ also, when He was in the world, was despised and rejected of men, and in His greatest necessity was left by His acquaintance and friends to bear these reproaches.  Christ was willing to suffer and be despised, and darest thou complain of any?  Christ had adversaries and gainsayers, and dost thou wish to have all men thy friends and benefactors?  Whence shall thy patience attain her crown if no adversity befall thee?  If thou art unwilling to suffer any adversity, how shalt thou be the friend of Christ?  Sustain thyself with Christ and for Christ if thou wilt reign with Christ. 6. If thou hadst once entered into the mind of Jesus, and hadst tasted yea even a little of his tender love, then wouldst thou care nought for thine own convenience or inconvenience, but wouldst rather rejoice at trouble brought upon thee, because the love of Jesus maketh a man to despise himself.  He who loveth Jesus, and is inwardly true and free from inordinate affections, is able to turn himself readily unto God, and to rise above himself in spirit, and to enjoy fruitful peace. 7. He who knoweth things as they are and not as they are said or seem to be, he truly is wise, and is taught of God more than of men. He who knoweth how to walk from within, and to set little value upon outward things, requireth not places nor waiteth for seasons, for holding his intercourse with God.  The inward man quickly recollecteth himself, because he is never entirely given up to outward things.  No outward labour and no necessary occupations stand in his way, but as events fall out, so doth he fit himself to them.  He who is rightly disposed and ordered within careth not for the strange and perverse conduct of men.  A man is hindered and distracted in so far as he is moved by outward things. 8. If it were well with thee, and thou wert purified from evil, all things would work together for thy good and profiting.  For this cause do many things displease thee and often trouble thee, that thou art not yet perfectly dead to thyself nor separated from all earthly things.  Nothing so defileth and entangleth the heart of man as impure love towards created things.  If thou rejectest outward comfort thou wilt be able to contemplate heavenly things and frequently to be joyful inwardly. (1) Luke xvii. 21.   (2) John xiv. 23.   (3) Hebrews xiii. 14. CHAPTER II Of lowly submission Make no great account who is for thee or against thee, but mind only the present duty and take care that God be with thee in whatsoever thou doest.  Have a good conscience and God will defend thee, for he whom God will help no man's perverseness shall be able to hurt.  If thou knowest how to hold thy peace and to suffer, without doubt thou shalt see the help of the Lord.  He knoweth the time and the way to deliver thee, therefore must thou resign thyself to Him.  To God it belongeth to help and to deliver from all confusion.  Oftentimes it is very profitable for keeping us in greater humility, that others know and rebuke our faults. 2. When a man humbleth himself for his defects, he then easily pacifieth others and quickly satisfieth those that are angered against him.  God protecteth and delivereth the humble man, He loveth and comforteth the humble man, to the humble man He inclineth Himself, on the humble He bestoweth great grace, and when he is cast down He raiseth him to glory: to the humble He revealeth His secrets, and sweetly draweth and inviteth him to Himself.  The humble man having received reproach, is yet in sufficient peace, because he resteth on God and not on the world. Reckon not thyself to have profited in anywise unless thou feel thyself to be inferior to all. CHAPTER III Of the good, peaceable man First keep thyself in peace, and then shalt thou be able to be a peacemaker towards others.  A peaceable man doth more good than a well-learned.  A passionate man turneth even good into evil and easily believeth evil; a good, peaceable man converteth all things into good.  He who dwelleth in peace is suspicious of none, but he who is discontented and restless is tossed with many suspicions, and is neither quiet himself nor suffereth others to be quiet.  He often saith what he ought not to say, and omitteth what it were more expedient for him to do.  He considereth to what duties others are bound, and neglecteth those to which he is bound himself.  Therefore be zealous first over thyself, and then mayest thou righteously be zealous concerning thy neighbour. 2. Thou knowest well how to excuse and to colour thine own deeds, but thou wilt not accept the excuses of others.  It would be more just to accuse thyself and excuse thy brother.  If thou wilt that others bear with thee, bear thou with others.  Behold how far thou art as yet from the true charity and humility which knows not how to be angry or indignant against any save self alone. It is no great thing to mingle with the good and the meek, for this is naturally pleasing to all, and every one of us willingly enjoyeth peace and liketh best those who think with us: but to be able to live peaceably with the hard and perverse, or with the disorderly, or those who oppose us, this is a great grace and a thing much to be commended and most worthy of a man. 3. There are who keep themselves in peace and keep peace also with others, and there are who neither have peace nor suffer others to have peace; they are troublesome to others, but always more troublesome to themselves.  And there are who hold themselves in peace, and study to bring others unto peace; nevertheless, all our peace in this sad life lieth in humble suffering rather than in not feeling adversities.  He who best knoweth how to suffer shall possess the most peace; that man is conqueror of himself and lord of the world, the friend of Christ, and the inheritor of heaven. CHAPTER IV Of a pure mind and simple intention By two wings is man lifted above earthly things, even by simplicity and purity.  Simplicity ought to be in the intention, purity in the affection.  Simplicity reacheth towards God, purity apprehendeth Him and tasteth Him.  No good action will be distasteful to thee if thou be free within from inordinate affection.  If thou reachest after and seekest, nothing but the will of God and the benefit of thy neighbour, thou wilt entirely enjoy inward liberty.  If thine heart were right, then should every creature be a mirror of life and a book of holy doctrine. There is no creature so small and vile but that it showeth us the goodness of God. 2. If thou wert good and pure within, then wouldst thou look upon all things without hurt and understand them aright.  A pure heart seeth the very depths of heaven and hell.  Such as each one is inwardly, so judgeth he outwardly.  If there is any joy in the world surely the man of pure heart possesseth it, and if there is anywhere tribulation and anguish, the evil conscience knoweth it best.  As iron cast into the fire loseth rust and is made altogether glowing, so the man who turneth himself altogether unto God is freed from slothfulness and changed into a new man. 3. When a man beginneth to grow lukewarm, then he feareth a little labour, and willingly accepteth outward consolation; but when he beginneth perfectly to conquer himself and to walk manfully in the way of God, then he counteth as nothing those things which aforetime seemed to be so grievous unto him. CHAPTER V Of self-esteem We cannot place too little confidence in ourselves, because grace and understanding are often lacking to us.  Little light is there within us, and what we have we quickly lose by negligence. Oftentimes we perceive not how great is our inward blindness.  We often do ill and excuse it worse.  Sometimes we are moved by passion and count it zeal; we blame little faults in others and pass over great faults in ourselves.  Quickly enough we feel and reckon up what we bear at the hands of others, but we reflect not how much others are bearing from us.  He who would weigh well and rightly his own doings would not be the man to judge severely of another. 2. The spiritually-minded man putteth care of himself before all cares; and he who diligently attendeth to himself easily keepeth silence concerning others.  Thou wilt never be spiritually minded and godly unless thou art silent concerning other men's matters and take full heed to thyself.  If thou think wholly upon thyself and upon God, what thou seest out of doors shall move thee little.  Where art thou when thou art not present to thyself? and when thou hast overrun all things, what hath it profited thee, thyself being neglected?  If thou wouldst have peace and true unity, thou must put aside all other things, and gaze only upon thyself. 3. Then thou shalt make great progress if thou keep thyself free from all temporal care.  Thou shalt lamentably fall away if thou set a value upon any worldly thing.  Let nothing be great, nothing high, nothing pleasing, nothing acceptable unto thee, save God Himself or the things of God.  Reckon as altogether vain whatsoever consolation comes to thee from a creature.  The soul that loveth God looketh not to anything that is beneath God.  God alone is eternal and incomprehensible, filling all things, the solace of the soul, and the true joy of the heart. CHAPTER VI Of the joy of a good conscience The testimony of a good conscience is the glory of a good man. Have a good conscience and thou shalt ever have joy.  A good conscience is able to bear exceeding much, and is exceeding joyful in the midst of adversities; an evil conscience is ever fearful and unquiet.  Thou shalt rest sweetly if thy heart condemn thee not.  Never rejoice unless when thou hast done well. The wicked have never true joy, nor feel internal peace, for there is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.(1)  And if they say "we are in peace, there shall no harm happen unto us, and who shall dare to do us hurt?" believe them not, for suddenly shall the wrath of God rise up against them, and their deeds shall be brought to nought, and their thoughts shall perish. 2. To glory in tribulation is not grievous to him who loveth; for such glorying is glorying in the Cross of Christ.  Brief is the glory which is given and received of men.  Sadness always goeth hand in hand with the glory of the world.  The glory of the good is in their conscience, and not in the report of men.  The joy of the upright is from God and in God, and their joy is in the truth.  He who desireth true and eternal glory careth not for that which is temporal; and he who seeketh temporal glory, or who despiseth it from his heart, is proved to bear little love for that which is heavenly.  He who careth for neither praises nor reproaches hath great tranquillity of heart. 3. He will easily be contented and filled with peace, whose conscience is pure.  Thou art none the holier if thou art praised, nor the viler if thou art reproached.  Thou art what thou art; and thou canst not be better than God pronounceth thee to be.  If thou considerest well what thou art inwardly, thou wilt not care what men will say to thee.  Man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart:(2) man looketh on the deed, but God considereth the intent.  It is the token of a humble spirit always to do well, and to set little by oneself.  Not to look for consolation from any created thing is a sign of great purity and inward faithfulness. 4. He that seeketh no outward witness on his own behalf, showeth plainly that he hath committed himself wholly to God.  For not he that commendeth himself is approved, as St. Paul saith, but whom the Lord commendeth.(3)  To walk inwardly with God, and not to be held by any outer affections, is the state of a spiritual man. (1) Isaiah lvii. 21.   (2) 1 Samuel xvi. 7. (3) 2 Corinthians x. 18. CHAPTER VII Of loving Jesus above all things Blessed is he who understandeth what it is to love Jesus, and to despise himself for Jesus' sake.  He must give up all that he loveth for his Beloved, for Jesus will be loved alone above all things.  The love of created things is deceiving and unstable, but the love of Jesus is faithful and lasting.  He who cleaveth to created things will fall with their slipperiness; but he who embraceth Jesus will stand upright for ever.  Love Him and hold Him for thy friend, for He will not forsake thee when all depart from thee, nor will he suffer thee to perish at the last.  Thou must one day be separated from all, whether thou wilt or wilt not. 2. Cleave thou to Jesus in life and death, and commit thyself unto His faithfulness, who, when all men fail thee, is alone able to help thee.  Thy Beloved is such, by nature, that He will suffer no rival, but alone will possess thy heart, and as a king will sit upon His own throne.  If thou wouldst learn to put away from thee every created thing, Jesus would freely take up His abode with thee.  Thou wilt find all trust little better than lost which thou hast placed in men, and not in Jesus.  Trust not nor lean upon a reed shaken with the wind, because all flesh is grass, and the goodliness thereof falleth as the flower of the field.(1) 3. Thou wilt be quickly deceived if thou lookest only upon the outward appearance of men, for if thou seekest thy comfort and profit in others, thou shalt too often experience loss.  If thou seekest Jesus in all things thou shalt verily find Jesus, but if thou seekest thyself thou shalt also find thyself, but to thine own hurt.  For if a man seeketh not Jesus he is more hurtful to himself than all the world and all his adversaries. (1) Isaiah xl. 6. CHAPTER VIII Of the intimate love of Jesus When Jesus is present all is well and nothing seemeth hard, but when Jesus is not present everything is hard.  When Jesus speaketh not within, our comfort is nothing worth, but if Jesus speaketh but a single word great is the comfort we experience. Did not Mary Magdalene rise up quickly from the place where she wept when Martha said to her, The Master is come and calleth for thee?(1)  Happy hour when Jesus calleth thee from tears to the joy of the spirit!  How dry and hard art thou without Jesus!  How senseless and vain if thou desirest aught beyond Jesus!  Is not this greater loss than if thou shouldst lose the whole world? 2. What can the world profit thee without Jesus?  To be without Jesus is the nethermost hell, and to be with Jesus is sweet paradise.  If Jesus were with thee no enemy could hurt thee.  He who findeth Jesus findeth a good treasure, yea, good above all good; and he who loseth Jesus loseth exceeding much, yea, more than the whole world.  Most poor is he who liveth without Jesus, and most rich is he who is much with Jesus. 3. It is great skill to know how to live with Jesus, and to know how to hold Jesus is great wisdom.  Be thou humble and peaceable and Jesus shall be with thee.  Be godly and quiet, and Jesus will remain with thee.  Thou canst quickly drive away Jesus and lose His favour if thou wilt turn away to the outer things.  And if thou hast put Him to flight and lost Him, to whom wilt thou flee, and whom then wilt thou seek for a friend?  Without a friend thou canst not live long, and if Jesus be not thy friend above all thou shalt be very sad and desolate.  Madly therefore doest thou if thou trusteth or findest joy in any other.  It is preferable to have the whole world against thee, than Jesus offended with thee.  Therefore of all that are dear to thee, let Jesus be specially loved. 4. Let all be loved for Jesus' sake, but Jesus for His own. Jesus Christ alone is to be specially loved, for He alone is found good and faithful above all friends.  For His sake and in Him let both enemies and friends be dear to thee, and pray for them all that they may all know and love Him.  Never desire to be specially praised or loved, because this belongeth to God alone, who hath none like unto Himself.  Nor wish thou that any one set his heart on thee, nor do thou give thyself up to the love of any, but let Jesus be in thee and in every good man. 5. Be pure and free within thyself, and be not entangled by any created thing.  Thou oughtest to bring a bare and clean heart to God, if thou desirest to be ready to see how gracious the Lord is.  And in truth, unless thou be prevented and drawn on by His grace, thou wilt not attain to this, that having cast out and dismissed all else, thou alone art united to God.  For when the grace of God cometh to a man, then he becometh able to do all things, and when it departeth then he will be poor and weak and given up unto troubles.  In these thou art not to be cast down nor to despair, but to rest with calm mind on the will of God, and to bear all things which come upon thee unto the praise of Jesus Christ; for after winter cometh summer, after night returneth day, after the tempest a great calm. (1) John xi. 28. CHAPTER IX Of the lack of all comfort It is no hard thing to despise human comfort when divine is present.  It is a great thing, yea very great, to be able to bear the loss both of human and divine comfort; and for the love of God willingly to bear exile of heart, and in nought to seek oneself, nor to look to one's own merit.  What great matter is it, if thou be cheerful of heart and devout when favour cometh to thee?  That is an hour wherein all rejoice.  Pleasantly enough doth he ride whom the grace of God carrieth.  And what marvel, if he feeleth no burden who is carried by the Almighty, and is led onwards by the Guide from on high? 2. We are willing to accept anything for comfort, and it is difficult for a man to be freed from himself.  The holy martyr Laurence overcame the love of the world and even of his priestly master, because he despised everything in the world which seemed to be pleasant; and for the love of Christ he calmly suffered even God's chief priest, Sixtus, whom he dearly loved, to be taken from him.  Thus by the love of the Creator he overcame the love of man, and instead of human comfort he chose rather God's good pleasure.  So also learn thou to resign any near and beloved friend for the love of God.  Nor take it amiss when thou hast been deserted by a friend, knowing that we must all be parted from one another at last. 3. Mightily and long must a man strive within himself before he learn altogether to overcome himself, and to draw his whole affection towards God.  When a man resteth upon himself, he easily slippeth away unto human comforts.  But a true lover of Christ, and a diligent seeker after virtue, falleth not back upon those comforts, nor seeketh such sweetness as may be tasted and handled, but desireth rather hard exercises, and to undertake severe labours for Christ. 4. When, therefore, spiritual comfort is given by God, receive it with giving of thanks, and know that it is the gift of God, not thy desert.  Be not lifted up, rejoice not overmuch nor foolishly presume, but rather be more humble for the gift, more wary and more careful in all thy doings; for that hour will pass away, and temptation will follow.  When comfort is taken from thee, do not straightway despair, but wait for the heavenly visitation with humility and patience, for God is able to give thee back greater favour and consolation.  This is not new nor strange to those who have made trial of the way of God, for with the great saints and the ancient prophets there was often this manner of change. 5. Wherefore one said when the favour of God was present with him, I said in my prosperity I shall never be moved,(1) but he goeth on to say what he felt within himself when the favour departed: Thou didst turn Thy face from me, and I was troubled. In spite whereof he in no wise despaireth, but the more instantly entreateth God, and saith, Unto Thee, O Lord, will I cry, and will pray unto my God; and then he receiveth the fruit of his prayer, and testifieth how he hath been heard, saying, The Lord heard me and had mercy upon me, the Lord was my helper.  But wherein?  Thou hast turned my heaviness into joy, Thou hast put off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness.  If it was thus with the great saints, we who are poor and needy ought not to despair if we are sometimes in the warmth and sometimes in the cold, for the Spirit cometh and goeth according to the good pleasure of His will.  Wherefore holy Job saith, Thou dost visit him in the morning, and suddenly Thou dost prove him.(2) 6. Whereupon then can I hope, or wherein may I trust, save only in the great mercy of God, and the hope of heavenly grace?  For whether good men are with me, godly brethren or faithful friends, whether holy books or beautiful discourses, whether sweet hymns and songs, all these help but little, and have but little savour when I am deserted by God's favour and left to mine own poverty. There is no better remedy, then, than patience and denial of self, and an abiding in the will of God. 7. I have never found any man so religious and godly, but that he felt sometimes a withdrawal of the divine favour, and lack of fervour.  No saint was ever so filled with rapture, so enlightened, but that sooner or later he was tempted.  For he is not worthy of the great vision of God, who, for God's sake, hath not been exercised by some temptation.  For temptation is wont to go before as a sign of the comfort which shall follow, and heavenly comfort is promised to those who are proved by temptation.  As it is written, To him that overcometh I will give to eat of the tree of life.(3) 8. Divine comfort is given that a man may be stronger to bear adversities.  And temptation followeth, lest he be lifted up because of the benefit.  The devil sleepeth not; thy flesh is not yet dead; therefore, cease thou not to make thyself ready unto the battle, for enemies stand on thy right hand and on thy left, and they are never at rest. (1) Psalm xxx. 6.  (2) Job vii. 18.  (3) Revelation ii. 7. CHAPTER X Of gratitude for the Grace of God Why seekest thou rest when thou art born to labour?  Prepare thyself for patience more than for comforts, and for bearing the cross more than for joy.  For who among the men of this world would not gladly receive consolation and spiritual joy if he might always have it?  For spiritual comforts exceed all the delights of the world, and all the pleasures of the flesh.  For all worldly delights are either empty or unclean, whilst spiritual delights alone are pleasant and honourable, the offspring of virtue, and poured forth by God into pure minds. But no man can always enjoy these divine comforts at his own will, because the season of temptation ceaseth not for long. 2. Great is the difference between a visitation from above and false liberty of spirit and great confidence in self.  God doeth well in giving us the grace of comfort, but man doeth ill in not immediately giving God thanks thereof.  And thus the gifts of grace are not able to flow unto us, because we are ungrateful to the Author of them, and return them not wholly to the Fountain whence they flow.  For grace ever becometh the portion of him who is grateful and that is taken away from the proud, which is wont to be given to the humble. 3. I desire no consolation which taketh away from me compunction, I love no contemplation which leadeth to pride.  For all that is high is not holy, nor is everything that is sweet good; every desire is not pure; nor is everything that is dear to us pleasing unto God.  Willingly do I accept that grace whereby I am made humbler and more wary and more ready to renounce myself.  He who is made learned by the gift of grace and taught wisdom by the stroke of the withdrawal thereof, will not dare to claim any good thing for himself, but will rather confess that he is poor and needy.  Give unto God the thing which is God's,(1) and ascribe to thyself that which is thine; that is, give thanks unto God for His grace, but for thyself alone confess thy fault, and that thy punishment is deserved for thy fault. 4. Sit thou down always in the lowest room and thou shalt be given the highest place.(2)  For the highest cannot be without the lowest.  For the highest saints of God are least in their own sight, and the more glorious they are, so much the lowlier are they in themselves; full of grace and heavenly glory, they are not desirous of vain-glory; resting on God and strong in His might, they cannot be lifted up in any wise.  And they who ascribe unto God all the good which they have received, "seek not glory one of another, but the glory which cometh from God only," and they desire that God shall be praised in Himself and in all His Saints above all things, and they are always striving for this very thing. 5. Be thankful, therefore, for the least benefit and thou shalt be worthy to receive greater.  Let the least be unto thee even as the greatest, and let that which is of little account be unto thee as a special gift.  If the majesty of the Giver be considered, nothing that is given shall seem small and of no worth, for that is not a small thing which is given by the Most High God.  Yea, though He gave punishment and stripes, we ought to be thankful, because He ever doth for our profit whatever He suffereth to come upon us.  He who seeketh to retain the favour of God, let him be thankful for the favour which is given, and patient in respect of that which is taken away.  Let him pray that it may return; let him be wary and humble that he lose it not. (1) Matthew xxii. 21.   (2) Luke xiv. 10. CHAPTER XI Of the fewness of those who love the Cross of Jesus Jesus hath many lovers of His heavenly kingdom, but few bearers of His Cross.  He hath many seekers of comfort, but few of tribulation.  He findeth many companions of His table, but few of His fasting.  All desire to rejoice with Him, few are willing to undergo anything for His sake.  Many follow Jesus that they may eat of His loaves, but few that they may drink of the cup of His passion.  Many are astonished at His Miracles, few follow after the shame of His Cross.  Many love Jesus so long as no adversities happen to them.  Many praise Him and bless Him, so long as they receive any comforts from Him.  But if Jesus hide Himself and withdraw from them a little while, they fall either into complaining or into too great dejection of mind. 2. But they who love Jesus for Jesus' sake, and not for any consolation of their own, bless Him in all tribulation and anguish of heart as in the highest consolation.  And if He should never give them consolation, nevertheless they would always praise Him and always give Him thanks. 3. Oh what power hath the pure love of Jesus, unmixed with any gain or love of self!  Should not all they be called mercenary who are always seeking consolations?  Do they not prove themselves lovers of self more than of Christ who are always seeking their own gain and advantage?  Where shall be found one who is willing to serve God altogether for nought? 4. Rarely is any one found so spiritual as to be stripped of all selfish thoughts, for who shall find a man truly poor in spirit and free of all created things?  "His value is from afar, yea from the ends of the earth."  A man may give away all his goods, yet that is nothing; and if he do many deeds of penitence, yet that is a small thing; and though he understand all knowledge, yet that is afar off; and if he have great virtue and zealous devotion, yet much is lacking unto him, yea, one thing which is the most necessary to him of all.  What is it then?  That having given up all things besides, he give up himself and go forth from himself utterly, and retain nothing of self-love; and having done all things which he knoweth to be his duty to do, that he feel that he hath done nothing.  Let him not reckon that much which might be much esteemed, but let him pronounce himself to be in truth an unprofitable servant, as the Truth Himself saith, When ye have done all things that are commanded you, say, we are unprofitable servants.(1)  Then may he be truly poor and naked in spirit, and be able to say with the Prophet, As for me, I am poor and needy.(2)  Nevertheless, no man is richer than he, no man stronger, no man freer.  For he knoweth both how to give up himself and all things, and how to be lowly in his own eyes. (1) Luke xvii. 10.   (2) Psalm xxv. 16. CHAPTER XII Of the royal way of the Holy Cross That seemeth a hard saying to many, If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his Cross and follow Me.(1) But it will be much harder to hear that last sentence, Depart from me, ye wicked, into eternal fire.(2)  For they who now willingly hear the word of the Cross and follow it, shall not then fear the hearing of eternal damnation.  This sign of the Cross shall be in heaven when the Lord cometh to Judgment.  Then all servants of the Cross, who in life have conformed themselves to the Crucified, shall draw nigh unto Christ the Judge with great boldness. 2. Why fearest thou then to take up the cross which leadeth to a kingdom?  In the Cross is health, in the Cross is life, in the Cross is protection from enemies, in the Cross is heavenly sweetness, in the Cross strength of mind, in the Cross joy of the spirit, in the Cross the height of virtue, in the Cross perfection of holiness.  There is no health of the soul, no hope of eternal life, save in the Cross.  Take up therefore, thy cross and follow Jesus and thou shalt go into eternal life.  He went before thee bearing His Cross and died for thee upon the Cross, that thou also mayest bear thy cross and mayest love to be crucified upon it.  For if thou be dead with Him, thou shalt also live with Him, and if thou be a partaker of His sufferings thou shalt be also of His glory. 3. Behold everything dependeth upon the Cross, and everything lieth in dying; and there is none other way unto life and to true inward peace, except the way of the Holy Cross and of daily mortification.  Go where thou wilt, seek whatsoever thou wilt, and thou shalt find no higher way above nor safer way below, than the way of the Holy Cross.  Dispose and order all things according to thine own will and judgment, and thou shalt ever find something to suffer either willingly or unwillingly, and thus thou shalt ever find thy cross.  For thou shalt either feel pain of body, or tribulation of spirit within thy soul. 4. Sometimes thou wilt be forsaken of God, sometimes thou wilt be tried by thy neighbour, and which is more, thou wilt often be wearisome to thyself.  And still thou canst not be delivered nor eased by any remedy or consolation, but must bear so long as God will.  For God will have thee learn to suffer tribulation without consolation, and to submit thyself fully to it, and by tribulation be made more humble.  No man understandeth the Passion of Christ in his heart so well as he who hath had somewhat of the like suffering himself.  The Cross therefore is always ready, and every where waiteth for thee.  Thou canst not flee from it whithersoever thou hurriest, for whithersoever thou comest, thou bearest thyself with thee, and shalt ever find thyself.  Turn thee above, turn thee below, turn thee without, turn thee within, and in them all thou shalt find the Cross; and needful is it that thou everywhere possess patience if thou wilt have internal peace and gain the everlasting crown. 5. If thou willingly bear the Cross, it will bear thee, and will bring thee to the end which thou seekest, even where there shall be the end of suffering; though it shall not be here.  If thou bear it unwillingly, thou makest a burden for thyself and greatly increaseth thy load, and yet thou must bear it.  If thou cast away one cross, without doubt thou shalt find another and perchance a heavier. 6. Thinketh thou to escape what no mortal hath been able to avoid?  Which of the saints in the world hath been without the cross and tribulation?  For not even Jesus Christ our Lord was one hour without the anguish of His Passion, so long as He lived. It behooved, He said, Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead, and so enter into his glory.(3)  And how dost thou seek another way than this royal way, which is the way of the Holy Cross? 7. The whole life of Christ was a cross and martyrdom, and dost thou seek for thyself rest and joy?  Thou art wrong, thou art wrong, if thou seekest aught but to suffer tribulations, for this whole mortal life is full of miseries, and set round with crosses.  And the higher a man hath advanced in the spirit, the heavier crosses he will often find, because the sorrow of his banishment increaseth with the strength of his love. 8. But yet the man who is thus in so many wise afflicted, is not without refreshment of consolation, because he feeleth abundant fruit to be growing within him out of the bearing of his cross. For whilst he willingly submitteth himself to it, every burden of tribulation is turned into an assurance of divine comfort, and the more the flesh is wasted by affliction, the more is the spirit strengthened mightily by inward grace.  And ofttimes so greatly is he comforted by the desire for tribulation and adversity, through love of conformity to the Cross of Christ, that he would not be without sorrow and tribulation; for he believeth that he shall be the more acceptable to God, the more and the heavier burdens he is able to bear for His sake.  This is not the virtue of man, but the grace of Christ which hath such power and energy in the weak flesh, that what it naturally hateth and fleeth from, this it draweth to and loveth through fervour of spirit. 9. It is not in the nature of man to bear the cross, to love the cross, to keep under the body and to bring it into subjection, to fly from honours, to bear reproaches meekly, to despise self and desire to be despised, to bear all adversities and losses, and to desire no prosperity in this world.  If thou lookest to thyself, thou wilt of thyself be able to do none of this; but if thou trustest in the Lord, endurance shall be given thee from heaven, and the world and the flesh shall be made subject to thy command. Yea, thou shalt not even fear thine adversary the devil, if thou be armed with faith and signed with the Cross of Christ. 10. Set thyself, therefore, like a good and faithful servant of Christ, to the manful bearing of the Cross of thy Lord, who out of love was crucified for thee.  Prepare thyself for the bearing many adversities and manifold troubles in this wretched life; because so it shall be with thee wheresoever thou art, and so in very deed thou shalt find it, wherever thou hide thyself.  This it must be; and there is no means of escaping from tribulation and sorrow, except to bear them patiently.  Drink thou lovingly thy Lord's cup if thou desirest to be His friend and to have thy lot with Him.  Leave consolations to God, let Him do as seemeth best to Him concerning them.  But do thou set thyself to endure tribulations, and reckon them the best consolations; for the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us,(4) nor would they be even if thou wert to endure them all. 11. When thou hast come to this, that tribulation is sweet and pleasant to thee for Christ's sake, then reckon that it is well with thee, because thou hast found paradise on earth.  So long as it is hard to thee to suffer and thou desirest to escape, so long it will not be well with thee, and tribulations will follow thee everywhere. 12. If thou settest thyself to that thou oughtest, namely, to suffer and to die, it shall soon go better with thee, and thou shalt find peace.  Though thou shouldest be caught up with Paul unto the third heaven,(5) thou art not on that account secure from suffering evil.  I will show him, saith Jesus, what great things he must suffer for My Name's sake.(6)  It remaineth, therefore, to thee to suffer, if thou wilt love Jesus and serve Him continually. 13. Oh that thou wert worthy to suffer something for the name of Jesus, how great glory should await thee, what rejoicing among all the saints of God, what bright example also to thy neighbour! For all men commend patience, although few be willing to practise it.  Thou oughtest surely to suffer a little for Christ when many suffer heavier things for the world. 14. Know thou of a surety that thou oughtest to lead the life of a dying man.  And the more a man dieth to himself, the more he beginneth to live towards God.  None is fit for the understanding of heavenly things, unless he hath submitted himself to bearing adversities for Christ.  Nothing more acceptable to God, nothing more healthful for thyself in this world, than to suffer willingly for Christ.  And if it were thine to choose, thou oughtest rather to wish to suffer adversities for Christ, than to be refreshed with manifold consolations, for thou wouldest be more like Christ and more conformed to all saints.  For our worthiness and growth in grace lieth not in many delights and consolations, but rather in bearing many troubles and adversities. 15. If indeed there had been anything better and more profitable to the health of men than to suffer, Christ would surely have shown it by word and example.  For both the disciples who followed Him, and all who desire to follow Him, He plainly exhorteth to bear their cross, and saith, If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross, and follow Me.(7)  So now that we have thoroughly read and studied all things, let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter.  We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.(8) (1) Matthew xvi. 24.   (2) Matthew xxv. 41.   (3) Luke xxiv. 46. (4) Romans viii. 18.   (5) 2 Corinthians xii. 2. (6) Acts ix. 16.   (7) Luke ix. 23.   (8) Acts xiv. 21. THE THIRD BOOK ON INWARD CONSOLATION CHAPTER I Of the inward voice of Christ to the faithful soul I will hearken what the Lord God shall say within me.(1)  Blessed is the soul which heareth the Lord speaking within it, and receiveth the word of consolation from His mouth.  Blessed are the ears which receive the echoes of the soft whisper of God, and turn not aside to the whisperings of this world.  Blessed truly are the ears which listen not to the voice that soundeth without, but to that which teacheth truth inwardly.  Blessed are the eyes which are closed to things without, but are fixed upon things within.  Blessed are they who search inward things and study to prepare themselves more and more by daily exercises for the receiving of heavenly mysteries.  Blessed are they who long to have leisure for God, and free themselves from every hindrance of the world.  Think on these things, O my soul, and shut the doors of thy carnal desires, so mayest thou hear what the Lord God will say within thee. 2. These things saith thy Beloved, "I am thy salvation, I am thy peace and thy life.  Keep thee unto Me, and thou shalt find peace."  Put away thee all transitory things, seek those things that are eternal.  For what are all temporal things but deceits, and what shall all created things help thee if thou be forsaken by the Creator?  Therefore put all things else away, and give thyself to the Creator, to be well pleasing and faithful to Him, that thou mayest be able to attain true blessedness. (1) Psalm lxxxv. 8. CHAPTER II What the truth saith inwardly without noise of words Speak Lord, for thy servant heareth.(1)  I am Thy servant; O give me understanding that I may know Thy testimonies.  Incline my heart unto the words of Thy mouth.(2)  Let thy speech distil as the dew.  The children of Israel spake in old time to Moses, Speak thou unto us and we will hear, but let not the Lord speak unto us lest we die.(3)  Not thus, O Lord, not thus do I pray, but rather with Samuel the prophet, I beseech Thee humbly and earnestly, Speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth.  Let not Moses speak to me, nor any prophet, but rather speak Thou, O Lord, who didst inspire and illuminate all the prophets; for Thou alone without them canst perfectly fill me with knowledge, whilst they without Thee shall profit nothing. 2. They can indeed utter words, but they give not the spirit. They speak with exceeding beauty, but when Thou art silent they kindle not the heart.  They give us scriptures, but Thou makest known the sense thereof.  They bring us mysteries, but Thou revealest the things which are signified.  They utter commandments, but Thou helpest to the fulfilling of them.  They show the way, but Thou givest strength for the journey.  They act only outwardly, but Thou dost instruct and enlighten the heart. They water, but Thou givest the increase.  They cry with words, but Thou givest understanding to the hearer. 3. Therefore let not Moses speak to me, but Thou, O Lord my God, Eternal Truth; lest I die and bring forth no fruit, being outwardly admonished, but not enkindled within; lest the word heard but not followed, known but not loved, believed but not obeyed, rise up against me in the judgment.  Speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth; Thou hast the words of eternal life.(4)  Speak unto me for some consolation unto my soul, for the amendment of my whole life, and for the praise and glory and eternal honour of Thy Name. (1) 1 Samuel iii. 9.   (2) Psalm cxix. 125.   (3) Exodus xx. 19. (4) John vi. 68. CHAPTER III How all the words of God are to be heard with humility, and how many consider them not "My Son, hear My words, for My words are most sweet, surpassing all the knowledge of the philosophers and wise men of this world. My words are spirit, and they are life,(1) and are not to be weighed by man's understanding.  They are not to be drawn forth for vain approbation, but to be heard in silence, and to be received with all humility and with deep love." 2. And I said, "Blessed is the man whom Thou teachest, O Lord, and instructest him in Thy law, that Thou mayest give him rest in time of adversity,(2) and that he be not desolate in the earth." 3. "I," saith the Lord, "taught the prophets from the beginning, and even now cease I not to speak unto all; but many are deaf and hardened against My voice; many love to listen to the world rather than to God, they follow after the desires of the flesh more readily than after the good pleasure of God.  The world promiseth things that are temporal and small, and it is served with great eagerness.  I promise things that are great and eternal, and the hearts of mortals are slow to stir.  Who serveth and obeyeth Me in all things, with such carefulness as he serveth the world and its rulers? 		Be thou ashamed, O Sidon, saith the sea;(3) 		And if thou reason seekest, hear thou me. For a little reward men make a long journey; for eternal life many will scarce lift a foot once from the ground.  Mean reward is sought after; for a single piece of money sometimes there is shameful striving; for a thing which is vain and for a trifling promise, men shrink not from toiling day and night." 4. "But, O shame! for an unchangeable good, for an inestimable reward, for the highest honour and for a glory that fadeth not away, it is irksome to them to toil even a little.  Be thou ashamed therefore, slothful and discontented servant, for they are found readier unto perdition than thou unto life.  They rejoice more heartily in vanity than thou in the truth. Sometimes, indeed, they are disappointed of their hope, but my promise faileth no man, nor sendeth away empty him who trusteth in Me.  What I have promised I will give; what I have said I will fulfil; if only a man remain faithful in My love unto the end. Therefore am I the rewarder of all good men, and a strong approver of all who are godly. 5. "Write My words in thy heart and consider them diligently, for they shall be very needful to thee in time of temptation.  What thou understandest not when thou readest, thou shalt know in the time of thy visitation.  I am wont to visit Mine elect in twofold manner, even by temptation and by comfort, and I teach them two lessons day by day, the one in chiding their faults, the other in exhorting them to grow in grace.  He who hath My words and rejecteth them, hath one who shall judge him at the last day." A PRAYER FOR THE SPIRIT OF DEVOTION 6. O Lord my God, Thou art all my good, and who am I that I should dare to speak unto Thee?  I am the very poorest of Thy servants, an abject worm, much poorer and more despicable than I know or dare to say.  Nevertheless remember, O Lord, that I am nothing, I have nothing, and can do nothing.  Thou only art good, just and holy; Thou canst do all things, art over all things, fillest all things, leaving empty only the sinner.  Call to mind Thy tender mercies, and fill my heart with Thy grace, Thou who wilt not that Thy work should return to Thee void. 7. How can I bear this miserable life unless Thy mercy and grace strengthen me?  Turn not away Thy face from me, delay not Thy visitation.  Withdraw not Thou Thy comfort from me, lest my soul "gasp after thee as a thirsty land."  Lord, teach me to do Thy will, teach me to walk humbly and uprightly before Thee, for Thou art my wisdom, who knowest me in truth, and knewest me before the world was made and before I was born into the world. (1) John vi. 63.   (2) Psalm xciv. 13.   (3) Isaiah xxiii. 4. CHAPTER IV How we must walk in truth and humility before God "My Son! walk before Me in truth, and in the simplicity of thy heart seek Me continually.  He who walketh before Me in the truth shall be safe from evil assaults, and the truth shall deliver him from the wiles and slanders of the wicked.  If the truth shall make thee free, thou shalt be free indeed, and shalt not care for the vain words of men." 2. Lord, it is true as Thou sayest; let it, I pray Thee, be so with me; let Thy truth teach me, let it keep me and preserve me safe unto the end.  Let it free me from all evil and inordinate affection, and I will walk before Thee in great freedom of heart. 3. "I will teach thee," saith the Truth, "the things which are right and pleasing before Me.  Think upon thy sins with great displeasure and sorrow, and never think thyself anything because of thy good works.  Verily thou art a sinner, liable to many passions, yea, tied and bound with them.  Of thyself thou always tendest unto nothing, thou wilt quickly fall, quickly be conquered, quickly disturbed, quickly undone.  Thou hast nought whereof to glory, but many reasons why thou shouldest reckon thyself vile, for thou art far weaker than thou art able to comprehend. 4. "Let, therefore, nothing which thou doest seem to thee great; let nothing be grand, nothing of value or beauty, nothing worthy of honour, nothing lofty, nothing praiseworthy or desirable, save what is eternal.  Let the eternal truth please thee above all things, let thine own great vileness displease thee continually.  Fear, denounce, flee nothing so much as thine own faults and sins, which ought to be more displeasing to thee than any loss whatsoever of goods.  There are some who walk not sincerely before me, but being led by curiosity and pride, they desire to know my secret things and to understand the deep things of God, whilst they neglect themselves and their salvation. These often fall into great temptations and sins because of their pride and curiosity, for I am against them. 5. "Fear thou the judgments of God, fear greatly the wrath of the Almighty.  Shrink from debating upon the works of the Most High, but search narrowly thine own iniquities into what great sins thou hast fallen, and how many good things thou hast neglected. There are some who carry their devotion only in books, some in pictures, some in outward signs and figures; some have Me in their mouths, but little in their hearts.  Others there are who, being enlightened in their understanding and purged in their affections, continually long after eternal things, hear of earthly things with unwillingness, obey the necessities of nature with sorrow.  And these understand what the Spirit of truth speaketh in them; for He teacheth them to despise earthly things and to love heavenly; to neglect the world and to desire heaven all the day and night." CHAPTER V Of the wonderful power of the Divine Love I bless Thee, O Heavenly Father, Father of my Lord Jesus Christ, for that Thou hast vouchsafed to think of me, poor that I am.  O, Father of Mercies and God of all comfort,(1) I give thanks unto Thee, who refreshest me sometimes with thine own comfort, when I am unworthy of any comfort.  I bless and glorify Thee continually, with thine only begotten Son and the Holy Ghost, the Paraclete, for ever and ever.  O Lord God, Holy lover of my soul, when Thou shalt come into my heart, all my inward parts shall rejoice.  Thou art my glory and the joy of my heart.  Thou art my hope and my refuge in the day of my trouble. 2. But because I am still weak in love and imperfect in virtue, I need to be strengthened and comforted by Thee; therefore visit Thou me often and instruct me with Thy holy ways of discipline. Deliver me from evil passions, and cleanse my heart from all inordinate affections, that, being healed and altogether cleansed within, I may be made ready to love, strong to suffer, steadfast to endure. 3. Love is a great thing, a good above all others, which alone maketh every heavy burden light, and equaliseth every inequality. For it beareth the burden and maketh it no burden, it maketh every bitter thing to be sweet and of good taste.  The surpassing love of Jesus impelleth to great works, and exciteth to the continual desiring of greater perfection.  Love willeth to be raised up, and not to be held down by any mean thing.  Love willeth to be free and aloof from all worldly affection, lest its inward power of vision be hindered, lest it be entangled by any worldly prosperity or overcome by adversity.  Nothing is sweeter than love, nothing stronger, nothing loftier, nothing broader, nothing pleasanter, nothing fuller or better in heaven nor on earth, for love was born of God and cannot rest save in God above all created things. 4. He who loveth flyeth, runneth, and is glad; he is free and not hindered.  He giveth all things for all things, and hath all things in all things, because he resteth in One who is high above all, from whom every good floweth and proceedeth.  He looketh not for gifts, but turneth himself to the Giver above all good things.  Love oftentimes knoweth no measure, but breaketh out above all measure; love feeleth no burden, reckoneth not labours, striveth after more than it is able to do, pleadeth not impossibility, because it judgeth all things which are lawful for it to be possible.  It is strong therefore for all things, and it fulfilleth many things, and is successful where he who loveth not faileth and lieth down. 5. Love is watchful, and whilst sleeping still keepeth watch; though fatigued it is not weary, though pressed it is not forced, though alarmed it is not terrified, but like the living flame and the burning torch, it breaketh forth on high and securely triumpheth.  If a man loveth, he knoweth what this voice crieth. For the ardent affection of the soul is a great clamour in the ears of God, and it saith: My God, my Beloved!  Thou art all mine, and I am all Thine. 6. Enlarge Thou me in love, that I may learn to taste with the innermost mouth of my heart how sweet it is to love, to be dissolved, and to swim in love.  Let me be holden by love, mounting above myself through exceeding fervour and admiration. Let me sing the song of love, let me follow Thee my Beloved on high, let my soul exhaust itself in Thy praise, exulting with love.  Let me love Thee more than myself, not loving myself except for Thy sake, and all men in Thee who truly love Thee, as the law of love commandeth which shineth forth from Thee. 7. Love is swift, sincere, pious, pleasant, gentle, strong, patient, faithful, prudent, long-suffering, manly, and never seeking her own; for wheresoever a man seeketh his own, there he falleth from love.  Love is circumspect, humble, and upright; not weak, not fickle, nor intent on vain things; sober, chaste, steadfast, quiet, and guarded in all the senses.  Love is subject and obedient to all that are in authority, vile and lowly in its own sight, devout and grateful towards God, faithful and always trusting in Him even when God hideth His face, for without sorrow we cannot live in love. 8. He who is not ready to suffer all things, and to conform to the will of the Beloved, is not worthy to be called a lover of God.  It behoveth him who loveth to embrace willingly all hard and bitter things for the Beloved's sake, and not to be drawn away from Him because of any contrary accidents. (1) 2 Corinthians i. 3. CHAPTER VI Of the proving of the true lover "My Son, thou art not yet strong and prudent in thy love." 2. Wherefore, O my Lord? 3. "Because for a little opposition thou fallest away from thy undertakings, and too eagerly seekest after consolation.  The strong lover standeth fast in temptations, and believeth not the evil persuasions of the enemy.  As in prosperity I please him, so in adversity I do not displease. 4. "The prudent lover considereth not the gift of the lover so much as the love of the giver.  He looketh for the affection more than the value, and setteth all gifts lower than the Beloved. The noble lover resteth not in the gift, but in Me above every gift. 5. "All is not lost, though thou sometimes think of Me or of My saints, less than thou shouldest desire.  That good and sweet affection which thou sometimes perceivest is the effect of present grace and some foretaste of the heavenly country; but hereon thou must not too much depend, for it goeth and cometh. But to strive against the evil motions of the mind which come to us, and to resist the suggestions of the devil, is a token of virtue and great merit. 6. "Therefore let not strange fancies disturb thee, whencesoever they arise.  Bravely observe thy purpose and thy upright intentions towards God.  It is not an illusion when thou art sometimes suddenly carried away into rapture, and then suddenly art brought back to the wonted vanities of thy heart.  For thou dost rather unwillingly undergo them than cause them; and so long as they displease thee and thou strivest against them, it is a merit and no loss. 7. "Know thou that thine old enemy altogether striveth to hinder thy pursuit after good, and to deter thee from every godly exercise, to wit, the contemplation of the Saints, the pious remembrance of My passion, the profitable recollection of sin, the keeping of thy own heart, and the steadfast purpose to grow in virtue.  He suggesteth to thee many evil thoughts, that he may work in thee weariness and terror, and so draw thee away from prayer and holy reading.  Humble confession displeaseth him, and if he were able he would make thee to cease from Communion. Believe him not, nor heed him, though many a time he hath laid for thee the snares of deceit.  Account it to be from him, when he suggesteth evil and unclean thoughts.  Say unto him, 'Depart unclean spirit; put on shame, miserable one; horribly unclean art thou, who bringest such things to mine ears.  Depart from me, detestable deceiver; thou shalt have no part in me; but Jesus shall be with me, as a strong warrior, and thou shalt stand confounded.  Rather would I die and bear all suffering, than consent unto thee.  Hold thy peace and be dumb; I will not hear thee more, though thou plottest more snares against me.  The Lord is my light and my salvation: whom then shall I fear?  Though a host of men should rise up against me, yet shall not my heart be afraid.  The Lord is my strength and my Redeemer.'(1) 8. "Strive thou like a good soldier; and if sometimes thou fail through weakness, put on thy strength more bravely than before, trusting in My more abundant grace, and take thou much heed of vain confidence and pride.  Because of it many are led into error, and sometimes fall into blindness well-nigh irremediable. Let this ruin of the proud, who foolishly lift themselves up, be to thee for a warning and a continual exhortation to humility." (1) Psalms xxvii. 1-3; xix. 14. CHAPTER VII Of hiding our grace under the guard of humility "My Son, it is better and safer for thee to hide the grace of devotion, and not to lift thyself up on high, nor to speak much thereof, nor to value it greatly; but rather to despise thyself, and to fear as though this grace were given to one unworthy thereof.  Nor must thou depend too much upon this feeling, for it can very quickly be turned into its opposite.  Think when thou art in a state of grace how miserable and poor thou art wont to be without grace.  Nor is there advance in spiritual life in this alone, that thou hast the grace of consolation, but that thou humbly and unselfishly and patiently takest the withdrawal thereof; so that thou cease not from the exercise of prayer, nor suffer thy other common duties to be in anywise neglected; rather do thy task more readily, as though thou hadst gained more strength and knowledge; and do not altogether neglect thyself because of the dearth and anxiety of spirit which thou feelest. 2. "For there are many who, when things have not gone prosperous with them, become forthwith impatient or slothful.  For the way of a man is not in himself,(1) but it is God's to give and to console, when He will, and as much as He will, and whom He will, as it shall please Him, and no further.  Some who were presumptuous because of the grace of devotion within them, have destroyed themselves, because they would do more than they were able, not considering the measure of their own littleness, but rather following the impulse of the heart than the judgment of the reason.  And because they presumed beyond what was well-pleasing unto God, therefore they quickly lost grace.  They became poor and were left vile, who had built for themselves their nest in heaven; so that being humbled and stricken with poverty, they might learn not to fly with their own wings, but to put their trust under My feathers.  They who are as yet new and unskilled in the way of the Lord, unless they rule themselves after the counsel of the wise, may easily be deceived and led away. 3. "But if they wish to follow their own fancies rather than trust the experience of others, the result will be very dangerous to them if they still refuse to be drawn away from their own notion.  Those who are wise in their own conceits, seldom patiently endure to be ruled by others.  It is better to have a small portion of wisdom with humility, and a slender understanding, than great treasures of sciences with vain self-esteem.  It is better for thee to have less than much of what may make thee proud.  He doeth not very discreetly who giveth up himself entirely to joy, forgetting his former helplessness and the chaste fear of the Lord, which feareth to lose the grace offered.  Nor is he very wise, after a manly sort, who in time of adversity, or any trouble whatsoever, beareth himself too despairingly, and feeleth concerning Me less trustfully than he ought. 4. "He who in time of peace willeth to be oversecure shall be often found in time of war overdispirited and full of fears.  If thou knewest always how to continue humble and moderate in thyself, and to guide and rule thine own spirit well, thou wouldest not so quickly fall into danger and mischief.  It is good counsel that when fervour of spirit is kindled, thou shouldest meditate how it will be with thee when the light is taken away.  Which when it doth happen, remember that still the light may return again, which I have taken away for a time for a warning to thee, and also for mine own glory.  Such a trial is often more useful than if thou hadst always things prosperous according to thine own will. 5. "For merits are not to be reckoned by this, that a man hath many visions or consolations, or that he is skilled in the Scriptures, or that he is placed in a high situation; but that he is grounded upon true humility and filled with divine charity, that he always purely and uprightly seeketh the honour of God, that he setteth not by himself, but unfeignedly despiseth himself, and even rejoiceth to be despised and humbled by others more than to be honoured." (1) Jeremiah x. 23. CHAPTER VIII Of a low estimation of self in the sight of God I will speak unto my Lord who am but dust and ashes.  If I count myself more, behold Thou standest against me, and my iniquities bear true testimony, and I cannot gainsay it.  But if I abase myself, and bring myself to nought, and shrink from all self-esteem, and grind myself to dust, which I am, Thy grace will be favourable unto me, and Thy light will be near unto my heart; and all self-esteem, how little soever it be, shall be swallowed up in the depths of my nothingness, and shall perish for ever. There Thou showest to me myself, what I am, what I was, and whither I have come: so foolish was I and ignorant.(1)  If I am left to myself, behold I am nothing, I am all weakness; but if suddenly Thou look upon me, immediately I am made strong, and filled with new joy.  And it is great marvel that I am so suddenly lifted up, and so graciously embraced by Thee, since I am always being carried to the deep by my own weight. 2. This is the doing of Thy love which freely goeth before me and succoureth me in so many necessities, which guardeth me also in great dangers and snatcheth me, as I may truly say, from innumerable evils.  For verily, by loving myself amiss, I lost myself, and by seeking and sincerely loving Thee alone, I found both myself and Thee, and through love I have brought myself to yet deeper nothingness: because Thou, O most sweet Lord, dealest with me beyond all merit, and above all which I dare ask or think. 3. Blessed be Thou, O my God, because though I be unworthy of all Thy benefits, Thy bountiful and infinite goodness never ceaseth to do good even to ingrates and to those who are turned far from Thee.  Turn Thou us unto Thyself, that we may be grateful, humble, and godly, for Thou art our salvation, our courage, and our strength. (1) Psalm lxxiii. 22. CHAPTER IX That all things are to be referred to God, as the final end "My Son, I must be thy Supreme and final end, if thou desirest to be truly happy.  Out of such purpose thy affection shall be purified, which too often is sinfully bent upon itself and upon created things.  For if thou seekest thyself in any matter, straightway thou wilt fail within thyself and grow barren. Therefore refer everything to Me first of all, for it is I who gave thee all.  So look upon each blessing as flowing from the Supreme Good, and thus all things are to be attributed to Me as their source. 2. "From Me the humble and great, the poor and the rich, draw water as from a living fountain, and those who serve Me with a free and faithful spirit shall receive grace for grace.  But he who will glory apart from Me, or will be delighted with any good which lieth in himself, shall not be established in true joy, nor shall be enlarged in heart, but shall be greatly hindered and thrown into tribulation.  Therefore thou must not ascribe any good to thyself, nor look upon virtue as belonging to any man, but ascribe it all unto God, without whom man hath nothing. I gave all, I will receive all again, and with great strictness require I the giving of thanks. 3. "This is the Truth, and by it the vanity of boasting is put to flight.  And if heavenly grace and true charity shall enter into thee, there shall be no envy, nor straitening of the heart, nor shall any self-love take possession of thee.  For divine charity conquereth all things, and enlargeth all the powers of the soul. If thou art truly wise, thou wilt rejoice in Me alone, thou wilt hope in Me alone; for there is none good but one, that is God,(1) Who is to be praised above all things, and in all things to receive blessing." (1) Luke xviii. 19. CHAPTER X That it is sweet to despise the world and to serve God Now will I speak again, O my Lord, and hold not my peace; I will say in the ears of my God, my Lord, and my King, who is exalted above all, Oh how plentiful is Thy goodness which Thou hast laid up for them that fear Thee!(1)  But what art Thou to those who love Thee?  What to those who serve Thee with their whole heart? Truly unspeakable is the sweetness of the contemplation of Thee, which Thou bestowest upon those who love Thee.  In this most of all Thou hast showed me the sweetness of Thy charity, that when I was not, Thou madest me, and when I wandered far from Thee, Thou broughtest me back that I might serve Thee, and commandedst me to love Thee. 2. O Fountain of perpetual love, what shall I say concerning Thee?  How shall I be unmindful of Thee, who didst vouchsafe to remember me, even after I pined away and perished?  Thou hast had mercy beyond all hope upon Thy servant, and hast showed Thy grace and friendship beyond all deserving.  What reward shall I render Thee for this Thy grace?  For it is not given unto all to renounce this world and its affairs, and to take up a religious life.  For is it a great thing that I should serve Thee, whom every creature ought to serve?  It ought not to seem a great thing to me to serve Thee; but rather this appeareth to me a great and wonderful thing, that Thou vouchsafest to receive as Thy servant one so poor and unworthy, and to join him unto Thy chosen servants. 3. Behold all things which I have are Thine, and with them I serve Thee.  And yet verily it is Thou who servest me, rather than I Thee.  Behold the heaven and the earth which Thou hast created for the service of men; they are at Thy bidding, and perform daily whatsoever Thou dost command.  Yea, and this is little; for Thou hast even ordained the Angels for the service of man.  But it surpasseth even all these things, that Thou Thyself didst vouchsafe to minister unto man, and didst promise that Thou wouldest give Thyself unto him. 4. What shall I render unto Thee for all these Thy manifold mercies?  Oh that I were able to serve Thee all the days of my life!  Oh that even for one day I were enabled to do Thee service worthy of Thyself!  For verily Thou art worthy of all service, all honour, and praise without end.  Verily Thou art my God, and I am Thy poor servant, who am bound to serve Thee with all my strength, nor ought I ever to grow weary of Thy praise.  This is my wish, this is my exceeding great desire, and whatsoever is lacking to me, vouchsafe Thou to supply. 5. It is great honour, great glory to serve Thee, and to despise all for Thy sake.  For they shall have great grace who of their own will shall submit themselves to Thy most holy service.  They who for Thy love have cast away every carnal delight shall find the sweetest consolation of the Holy Ghost.  They who enter the narrow way of life for Thy Name's sake, and have put away all worldly cares, shall attain great liberty of spirit. 6. Oh grateful and delightsome service of God, whereby man is made truly free and holy!  Oh sacred condition of the religious servant, which maketh man equal to the Angels, well-pleasing unto God, terrible to evil spirits, and acceptable to all faithful ones!  Oh service to be embraced and ever desired, in which the highest good is promised, and joy is gained which shall remain for evermore! (1) Psalm xxxi. 21. CHAPTER XI That the desires of the heart are to be examined and governed "My Son, thou hast still many things to learn, which thou hast not well learned yet." 2. What are they, Lord? 3. "To place thy desire altogether in subjection to My good pleasure, and not to be a lover of thyself, but an earnest seeker of My will.  Thy desires often excite and urge thee forward; but consider with thyself whether thou art not more moved for thine own objects than for My honour.  If it is Myself that thou seekest, thou shalt be well content with whatsoever I shall ordain; but if any pursuit of thine own lieth hidden within thee, behold it is this which hindereth and weigheth thee down. 4. "Beware, therefore, lest thou strive too earnestly after some desire which thou hast conceived, without taking counsel of Me; lest haply it repent thee afterwards, and that displease thee which before pleased, and for which thou didst long as for a great good.  For not every affection which seemeth good is to be forthwith followed; neither is every opposite affection to be immediately avoided.  Sometimes it is expedient to use restraint even in good desires and wishes, lest through importunity thou fall into distraction of mind, lest through want of discipline thou become a stumbling-block to others, or lest by the resistance of others thou be suddenly disturbed and brought to confusion. 5. "Sometimes, indeed, it is needful to use violence, and manfully to strive against the sensual appetite, and not to consider what the flesh may or not will; but rather to strive after this, that it may become subject, however unwillingly, to the spirit.  And for so long it ought to be chastised and compelled to undergo slavery, even until it be ready for all things, and learn to be contented with little, to be delighted with things simple, and never to murmur at any inconvenience." CHAPTER XII Of the inward growth of patience, and of the struggle against evil desires O Lord God, I see that patience is very necessary unto me; for many things in this life fall out contrary.  For howsoever I may have contrived for my peace, my life cannot go on without strife and trouble. 2. "Thou speakest truly, My Son.  For I will not that thou seek such a peace as is without trials, and knoweth no adversities; but rather that thou shouldest judge thyself to have found peace, when thou art tried with manifold tribulations, and proved by many adversities.  If thou shalt say that thou art not able to bear much, how then wilt thou sustain the fire hereafter?  Of two evils we should always choose the less.  Therefore, that thou mayest escape eternal torments hereafter, strive on God's behalf to endure present evils bravely.  Thinkest thou that the children of this world suffer nought, or but little?  Thou wilt not find it so, even though thou find out the most prosperous. 3. "'But,' thou wilt say, 'they have many delights, and they follow their own wills, and thus they bear lightly their tribulations.' 4. "Be it so, grant that they have what they list; but how long, thinkest thou, will it last?  Behold, like the smoke those who are rich in this world will pass away, and no record shall remain of their past joys.  Yea, even while they yet live, they rest not without bitterness and weariness and fear.  For from the very same thing wherein they find delight, thence they oftentimes have the punishment of sorrow.  Justly it befalleth them, that because out of measure they seek out and pursue pleasures, they enjoy them not without confusion and bitterness.  Oh how short, how false, how inordinate and wicked are all these pleasures!  Yet because of their sottishness and blindness men do not understand; but like brute beasts, for the sake of a little pleasure of this corruptible life, they incur death of the soul.  Thou therefore, my son, go not after thy lusts, but refrain thyself from thine appetites.(1)  Delight thou in the Lord, and He shall give thee thy heart's desire.(2) 5. "For if thou wilt truly find delight, and be abundantly comforted of Me, behold in the contempt of all worldly things and in the avoidance of all worthless pleasures shall be thy blessing, and fulness of consolation shall be given thee.  And the more thou withdrawest thyself from all solace of creatures, the more sweet and powerful consolations shalt thou find.  But at the first thou shalt not attain to them, without some sorrow and hard striving.  Long-accustomed habit will oppose, but it shall be overcome by better habit.  The flesh will murmur again and again, but will be restrained by fervour of spirit.  The old serpent will urge and embitter thee, but will be put to flight by prayer; moreover, by useful labour his entrance will be greatly obstructed." (1) Ecclesiastes xviii. 30.   (2) Psalm xxxvii. 4. CHAPTER XIII Of the obedience of one in lowly subjection after the example of Jesus Christ "My Son, he who striveth to withdraw himself from obedience, withdraweth himself also from grace, and he who seeketh private advantages, loseth those which are common unto all.  If a man submit not freely and willingly to one set over him, it is a sign that his flesh is not yet perfectly subject to himself, but often resisteth and murmureth.  Learn therefore quickly to submit thyself to him who is over thee, if thou seekest to bring thine own flesh into subjection.  For the outward enemy is very quickly overcome if the inner man have not been laid low.  There is no more grievous and deadly enemy to the soul than thou art to thyself, if thou art not led by the Spirit.  Thou must not altogether conceive contempt for thyself, if thou wilt prevail against flesh and blood.  Because as yet thou inordinately lovest thyself, therefore thou shrinkest from yielding thyself to the will of others. 2. "But what great thing is it that thou, who art dust and nothingness, yieldest thyself to man for God's sake, when I, the Almighty and the Most High, who created all things out of nothing, subjected Myself to man for thy sake?  I became the most humble and despised of men, that by My humility thou mightest overcome thy pride.  Learn to obey, O dust!  Learn to humble thyself, O earth and clay, and to bow thyself beneath the feet of all.  Learn to crush thy passions, and to yield thyself in all subjection. 3. "Be zealous against thyself, nor suffer pride to live within thee, but so show thyself subject and of no reputation, that all may be able to walk over thee, and tread thee down as the clay in the streets.  What hast thou, O foolish man, of which to complain?  What, O vile sinner, canst thou answer those who speak against thee, seeing thou hast so often offended God, and many a time hast deserved hell?  But Mine eye hath spared thee, because thy soul was precious in My sight; that thou mightest know My love, and mightest be thankful for My benefits; and that thou mightest give thyself altogether to true subjection and humility, and patiently bear the contempt which thou meritest." CHAPTER XIV Of meditation upon the hidden judgments of God, that we may not be lifted up because of our well-doing Thou sendest forth Thy judgments against me, O Lord, and shakest all my bones with fear and trembling, and my soul trembleth exceedingly.  I stand astonished, and remember that the heavens are not clean in thy sight.(1)  If Thou chargest Thine angels with folly, and didst spare them not, how shall it be unto me? Stars have fallen from heaven, and what shall I dare who am but dust?  They whose works seemed to be praiseworthy, fell into the lowest depths, and they who did eat Angels' food, them have I seen delighted with the husks that the swine do eat. 2. There is therefore no holiness, if Thou O Lord, withdraw Thine hand.  No wisdom profiteth, if Thou leave off to guide the helm. No strength availeth, if Thou cease to preserve.  No purity is secure, if Thou protect it not.  No self-keeping availeth, if Thy holy watching be not there.  For when we are left alone we are swallowed up and perish, but when we are visited, we are raised up, and we live.  For indeed we are unstable, but are made strong through Thee; we grow cold, but are rekindled by Thee. 3. Oh, how humbly and abjectly must I reckon of myself, how must I weigh it as nothing, if I seem to have nothing good!  Oh, how profoundly ought I to submit myself to Thy unfathomable judgments, O Lord, when I find myself nothing else save nothing, and again nothing!  Oh weight unmeasurable, oh ocean which cannot be crossed over, where I find nothing of myself save nothing altogether!  Where, then, is the hiding-place of glory, where the confidence begotten of virtue?  All vain-glory is swallowed up in the depths of Thy judgments against me. 4. What is all flesh in Thy sight?  For how shall the clay boast against Him that fashioned it?(2)  How can he be lifted up in vain speech whose heart is subjected in truth to God?  The whole world shall not lift him up whom Truth hath subdued; nor shall he be moved by the mouth of all who praise him, who hath placed all his hope in God.  For they themselves who speak, behold, they are all nothing; for they shall cease with the sound of their words, but the truth of the Lord endureth for ever.(3) (1) Job xv. 15.   (2) Psalm xxix. 16.   (3) Psalm cxvii. 2. CHAPTER XV How we must stand and speak, in everything that we desire "My Son, speak thou thus in every matter, 'Lord, if it please Thee, let this come to pass.  Lord, if this shall be for Thine honour, let it be done in Thy Name.  Lord, if thou see it good for me, and approve it as useful, then grant me to use it for Thy honour.  But if thou knowest that it shall be hurtful unto me, and not profitable for the health of my soul, take the desire away from me'!  For not every desire is from the Holy Ghost, although it appear to a man right and good.  It is difficult to judge with certainty whether a good or an evil spirit move thee to desire this or that, or whether thou art moved by thine own spirit.  Many have been deceived at the last, who seemed at the beginning to be moved by a good spirit. 2. "Therefore, whatsoever seemeth to thee desirable, thou must always desire and seek after it with the fear of God and humility of heart, and most of all, must altogether resign thyself, and commit all unto Me and say, 'Lord, thou knowest what is best; let this or that be, according as Thou wilt.  Give what Thou wilt, so much as Thou wilt, when Thou wilt.  Do with me as Thou knowest best, and as best shall please Thee, and as shall be most to Thine honour.  Place me where Thou wilt, and freely work Thy will with me in all things.  I am in Thine hand, and turn me in my course.  Behold, I am Thy servant, ready for all things; for I desire to live not to myself but to Thee.  Oh, that I might live worthily and perfectly.'" 		A PRAYER TO BE ENABLED TO DO GOD'S WILL PERFECTLY 3. Grant me Thy grace, most merciful Jesus, that it may be with me, and work in me, and persevere with me, even unto the end. Grant that I may ever desire and wish whatsoever is most pleasing and dear unto Thee.  Let Thy will be mine, and let my will alway follow Thine, and entirely accord with it.  May I choose and reject whatsoever Thou dost; yea, let it be impossible for me to choose or reject except according to Thy will. 4. Grant that I may die to all worldly things, and for Thy sake love to be despised and unknown in this world.  Grant unto me, above all things that I can desire, to rest in Thee, and that in Thee my heart may be at peace.  Thou art the true peace of the heart, Thou alone its rest; apart from Thee all things are hard and unquiet.  In Thee alone, the supreme and eternal God, I will lay me down in peace and take my rest.(1)  Amen. (1) Psalm iv. 9. CHAPTER XVI That true solace is to be sought in God alone Whatsoever I am able to desire or to think of for my solace, I look for it not here, but hereafter.  For if I alone had all the solaces of this world, and were able to enjoy all its delights, it is certain that they could not endure long.  Wherefore, O my soul, thou canst be fully comforted and perfectly refreshed, only in God, the Comforter of the poor, and the lifter up of the humble.  Wait but a little while, my soul, wait for the Divine promise, and thou shalt have abundance of all good things in heaven.  If thou longest too inordinately for the things which are now, thou shalt lose those which are eternal and heavenly. Let temporal things be in the use, eternal things in the desire. Thou canst not be satisfied with any temporal good, for thou wast not created for the enjoyment of these. 2. Although thou hadst all the good things which ever were created, yet couldst not thou be happy and blessed; all thy blessedness and thy felicity lieth in God who created all things; not such felicity as seemeth good to the foolish lover of the world, but such as Christ's good and faithful servants wait for, and as the spiritual and pure in heart sometimes taste, whose conversation is in heaven.(1)  All human solace is empty and short-lived; blessed and true is that solace which is felt inwardly, springing from the truth.  The godly man everywhere beareth about with him his own Comforter, Jesus, and saith unto Him: "Be with me, Lord Jesus, always and everywhere.  Let it be my comfort to be able to give up cheerfully all human comfort. And if Thy consolation fail me, let Thy will and righteous approval be alway with me for the highest comfort.  For Thou wilt not always be chiding, neither keepest Thou Thine anger for ever."(2) (1) Philippians iii. 20.   (2) Psalm cii. 9. CHAPTER XVII That all care is to be cast upon God "My Son, suffer me to do with thee what I will; I know what is expedient for thee.  Thou thinkest as a man, in many things thou judgest as human affection persuadeth thee." 2. Lord, what Thou sayest is true.  Greater is Thy care for me than all the care which I am able to take for myself.  For too insecurely doth he stand who casteth not all his care upon Thee. Lord, so long as my will standeth right and firm in Thee, do with me what Thou wilt, for whatsoever Thou shalt do with me cannot be aught but good.  Blessed be Thou if Thou wilt leave me in darkness: blessed also be Thou if Thou wilt leave me in light. Blessed be Thou if Thou vouchsafe to comfort me, and always blessed be Thou if Thou cause me to be troubled. 3. "My Son! even thus thou must stand if thou desirest to walk with Me.  Thou must be ready alike for suffering or rejoicing. Thou must be poor and needy as willingly as full and rich." 4. Lord, I will willingly bear for Thee whatsoever Thou wilt have to come upon me.  Without choice I will receive from Thy hand good and evil, sweet and bitter, joy and sadness, and will give Thee thanks for all things which shall happen unto me.  Keep me from all sin, and I will not fear death nor hell.  Only cast me not away for ever, nor blot me out of the book of life.  Then no tribulation which shall come upon me shall do me hurt. CHAPTER XVIII That temporal miseries are to be borne patiently after the example of Christ "My Son!  I came down from heaven for thy salvation; I took upon Me thy miseries not of necessity, but drawn by love that thou mightest learn patience and mightest bear temporal miseries without murmuring.  For from the hour of My birth, until My death upon the Cross, I ceased not from bearing of sorrow; I had much lack of temporal things; I oftentimes heard many reproaches against Myself; I gently bore contradictions and hard words; I received ingratitude for benefits, blasphemies for My miracles, rebukes for My doctrine." 2. Lord, because Thou wast patient in Thy life, herein most of all fulfilling the commandment of Thy Father, it is well that I, miserable sinner, should patiently bear myself according to Thy will, and as long as Thou wilt have it so, should bear about with me for my salvation, the burden of this corruptible life.  For although the present life seemeth burdensome, it is nevertheless already made very full of merit through Thy grace, and to those who are weak it becometh easier and brighter through Thy example and the footsteps of Thy saints; but it is also much more full of consolation than it was of old, under the old Testament, when the gate of heaven remained shut; and even the way to heaven seemed more obscure when so few cared to seek after the heavenly kingdom.  But not even those who were then just and in the way of salvation were able, before Thy Passion and the ransom of Thy holy Death, to enter the kingdom of heaven. 3. Oh what great thanks am I bound to give Thee, who hast vouchsafed to show me and all faithful people the good and right way to Thine eternal kingdom, for Thy way is our way, and by holy patience we walk to Thee who art our Crown.  If Thou hadst not gone before and taught us, who would care to follow?  Oh, how far would they have gone backward if they had not beheld Thy glorious example!  Behold we are still lukewarm, though we have heard of Thy many signs and discourses; what would become of us if we had not such a light to help us follow Thee? CHAPTER XIX Of bearing injuries, and who shall be approved as truly patient "What sayest thou, My Son?  Cease to complain; consider My suffering and that of My saints.  Thou hast not yet resisted unto blood.(1)  It is little which thou sufferest in comparison with those who have suffered so many things, have been so strongly tempted, so grievously troubled, so manywise proved and tried. Thou oughtest therefore to call to mind the more grievous sufferings of others that thou mightest bear thy lesser ones more easily, and if they seem not to thee little, see that it is not thy impatience which is the cause of this.  But whether they be little or whether they be great, study to bear them all with patience. 2. "So far as thou settest thyself to bear patiently, so far thou dost wisely and art deserving of the more merit; thou shalt also bear the more easily if thy mind and habit are carefully trained hereunto.  And say not 'I cannot bear these things from such a man, nor are things of this kind to be borne by me, for he hath done me grievous harm and imputeth to me what I had never thought: but from another I will suffer patiently, such things as I see I ought to suffer.'  Foolish  is such a thought as this, for it considereth not the virtue of patience, nor by whom that virtue is to be crowned, but it rather weigheth persons and offences against self. 3. "He is not truly patient who will only suffer as far as seemeth right to himself and from whom he pleaseth.  But the truly patient man considereth not by what man he is tried, whether by one above him, or by an equal or inferior, whether by a good and holy man, or a perverse and unworthy; but indifferently from every creature, whatsoever or how often soever adversity happeneth to him, he gratefully accepteth all from the hand of God and counteth it great gain: for with God nothing which is borne for His sake, however small, shall lose its reward. 4. "Be thou therefore ready for the fight if thou wilt have the victory.  Without striving thou canst not win the crown of patience; if thou wilt not suffer thou refusest to be crowned. But if thou desirest to be crowned, strive manfully, endure patiently.  Without labour thou drawest not near to rest, nor without fighting comest thou to victory." 5. Make possible to me, O Lord, by grace what seemeth impossible to me by nature.  Thou knowest how little I am able to bear, and how quickly I am cast down when a like adversity riseth up against me.  Whatsoever trial of tribulation may come to me, may it become unto me pleasing and acceptable, for to suffer and be vexed for Thy sake is exceeding healthful to the soul. (1) Hebrews xii. 4. CHAPTER XX Of confession of our infirmity and of the miseries of this life I will acknowledge my sin unto Thee;(1) I will confess to Thee, Lord, my infirmity.  It is often a small thing which casteth me down and maketh me sad.  I resolve that I will act bravely, but when a little temptation cometh, immediately I am in a great strait.  Wonderfully small sometimes is the matter whence a grievous temptation cometh, and whilst I imagine myself safe for a little space; when I am not considering, I find myself often almost overcome by a little puff of wind. 2. Behold, therefore, O Lord, my humility and my frailty, which is altogether known to Thee.  Be merciful unto me, and draw me out of the mire that I sink not,(2) lest I ever remain cast down. This is what frequently throweth me backward and confoundeth me before Thee, that I am so liable to fall, so weak to resist my passions.  And though their assault is not altogether according to my will, it is violent and grievous, and it altogether wearieth me to live thus daily in conflict.  Herein is my infirmity made known to me, that hateful fancies always rush in far more easily than they depart. 3. Oh that Thou, most mighty God of Israel, Lover of all faithful souls, wouldst look upon the labour and sorrow of Thy servant, and give him help in all things whereunto he striveth. Strengthen me with heavenly fortitude, lest the old man, this miserable flesh, not being yet fully subdued to the spirit, prevail to rule over me; against which I ought to strive so long as I remain in this most miserable life.  Oh what a life is this, where tribulations and miseries cease not, where all things are full of snares and of enemies, for when one tribulation or temptation goeth, another cometh, yea, while the former conflict is yet raging others come more in number and unexpected. 4. And how can the life of man be loved, seeing that it hath so many bitter things, that it is subjected to so many calamities and miseries.  How can it be even called life, when it produces so many deaths and plagues?  The world is often reproached because it is deceitful and vain, yet notwithstanding it is not easily given up, because the lusts of the flesh have too much rule over it.  Some draw us to love, some to hate.  The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, these draw to love of the world; but the punishments and miseries which righteously follow these things, bring forth hatred of the world and weariness. 5. But, alas! an evil desire conquereth a mind given to the world, and thinketh it happiness to be under the nettles(3) because it savoureth not nor perceiveth the sweetness of God nor the inward gracefulness of virtue.  But they who perfectly despise the world and strive to live unto God in holy discipline, these are not ignorant of the divine sweetness promised to all who truly deny themselves and see clearly how grievously the world erreth, and in how many ways it is deceived. (1) Psalm xxxii. 5.   (2) Psalm lix. 16.   (3) Job xxx. 7. CHAPTER XXI That we must rest in God above all goods and gifts Above all things and in all things thou shalt rest alway in the Lord, O my soul, for he himself is the eternal rest of the saints.  Grant me, most sweet and loving Jesus, to rest in Thee above every creature, above all health and beauty, above all glory and honour, above all power and dignity, above all knowledge and skilfulness, above all riches and arts, above all joy and exultation, above all fame and praise, above all sweetness and consolation, above all hope and promise, above all merit and desire, above all gifts and rewards which Thou canst give and pour forth, above all joy and jubilation which the mind is able to receive and feel; in a word, above Angels and Archangels and all the army of heaven, above all things visible and invisible, and above everything which Thou, O my God, art not. 2. For Thou, O Lord, my God, art best above all things; Thou only art the Most High, Thou only the Almighty, Thou only the All-sufficient, and the Fulness of all things; Thou only the All-delightsome and the All-comforting; Thou alone the altogether lovely and altogether loving; Thou alone the Most Exalted and Most Glorious above all things; in Whom all things are, and were, and ever shall be, altogether and all-perfect.  And thus it falleth short and is insufficient whatsoever Thou givest to me without Thyself or whatsoever Thou revealest or dost promise concerning Thyself, whilst Thou art not seen or fully possessed: since verily my heart cannot truly rest nor be entirely content, except it rest in Thee, and go beyond all gifts and every creature. 3. O my most beloved Spouse, Jesus Christ, most holy lover of my soul, Ruler of this whole Creation, who shall give me the wings of true liberty, that I may flee to Thee and find rest?  Oh when shall it be given me to be open to receive Thee to the full, and to see how sweet Thou art, O Lord my God?  When shall I collect myself altogether in Thee, that because of Thy love I may not feel myself at all, but may know Thee only above every sense and measure, in measure not known to others.  But now I ofttimes groan, and bear my sad estate with sorrow; because many evils befall me in this vale of miseries which continually disturb and fill me with sorrow, and encloud me, continually hinder and fill me with care, allure and entangle me, that I cannot have free access to Thee, nor enjoy that sweet intercourse which is always near at hand to the blessed spirits.  Let my deep sighing come before Thee, and my manifold desolation on the earth. 4. O Jesus, Light of Eternal Glory, solace of the wandering soul, before Thee my mouth is without speech, and my silence speaketh to Thee.  How long will my Lord delay to come unto me?  Let Him come unto me, His poor and humble one, and make me glad.  Let Him put forth His hand, and deliver His holy one from every snare. Come, Oh come; for without Thee shall be no joyful day or hour, for Thou art my joy, and without Thee is my table empty.  I am miserable, and in a manner imprisoned and loaded with fetters, until Thou refresh me by the light of Thy presence, and give me liberty, and show Thy loving countenance. 5. Let others seek some other thing instead of Thee, whatsoever it shall please them; but for my part nothing else pleaseth or shall please, save Thou, my God, my hope, my eternal salvation. I will not hold my peace, nor cease to implore, until Thy grace return, and until Thou speak to me within. 6. "Behold, here I am!  Behold, I come to thee, for thou didst call Me.  Thy tears and the longing of thy soul, thy humbleness and contrition of heart have inclined Me, and brought Me to thee." 7. And I said Lord, I have called upon Thee, and I have longed to enjoy Thee, being ready to reject everything for Thy sake.  For Thou didst first move me to seek Thee.  Therefore, blessed be Thou, O Lord, who has wrought this good work upon Thy servant, according to the multitude of Thy mercy.  What then hath Thy servant to say in Thy presence, save to humble himself greatly before Thee, being alway mindful of his own iniquity and vileness. For there is none like unto Thee in all marvels of heaven and earth.  Excellent are Thy works, true are Thy judgments, and by Thy Providence are all things governed.  Therefore praise and glory be unto Thee, O Wisdom of the Father, let my mouth and my soul and all created things praise and bless Thee together. CHAPTER XXII Of the recollection of God's manifold benefits Open, O Lord, my heart in Thy law, and teach me to walk in the way of Thy commandments.  Grant me to understand Thy will and to be mindful of Thy benefits, both general and special, with great reverence and diligent meditation, that thus I may be able worthily to give Thee thanks.  Yet I know and confess that I cannot render Thee due praises for the least of Thy mercies.  I am less than the least of all the good things which Thou gavest me; and when I consider Thy majesty, my spirit faileth because of the greatness thereof. 2. All things which we have in the soul and in the body, and whatsoever things we possess, whether outwardly or inwardly, naturally or supernaturally, are Thy good gifts, and prove Thee, from whom we have received them all, to be good, gentle, and kind.  Although one receiveth many things, and another fewer, yet all are Thine, and without Thee not even the least thing can be possessed.  He who hath received greater cannot boast that it is of his own merit, nor lift himself up above others, nor contemn those beneath him; for he is the greater and the better who ascribeth least to himself, and in giving thanks is the humbler and more devout; and he who holdeth himself to be viler than all, and judgeth himself to be the more unworthy, is the apter for receiving greater things. 3. But he who hath received fewer gifts, ought not to be cast down, nor to take it amiss, nor to envy him who is richer; but rather ought he to look unto Thee, and to greatly extol Thy goodness, for Thou pourest forth Thy gifts so richly, so freely and largely, without respect of persons.  All things come of Thee; therefore in all things shalt thou be praised.  Thou knowest what is best to be given to each; and why this man hath less, and that more, is not for us but for Thee to understand, for unto Thee each man's deservings are fully known. 4. Wherefore, O Lord God, I reckon it even a great benefit, not to have many things, whence praise and glory may appear outwardly, and after the thought of men.  For so it is that he who considereth his own poverty and vileness, ought not only to draw therefrom no grief or sorrow, or sadness of spirit, but rather comfort and cheerfulness; because Thou, Lord, hast chosen the poor and humble, and those who are poor in this world, to be Thy friends and acquaintance.  So give all Thine apostles witness whom Thou hast made princes in all lands.  Yet they had their conversation in this world blameless, so humble and meek, without any malice or deceit, that they even rejoiced to suffer rebukes for Thy Name's sake,(1) and what things the world hateth, they embraced with great joy. 5. Therefore ought nothing so much to rejoice him who loveth Thee and knoweth Thy benefits, as Thy will in him, and the good pleasure of Thine eternal Providence, wherewith he ought to be so contented and comforted, that he would as willingly be the least as any other would be the greatest, as peaceable and contented in the lowest as in the highest place, and as willingly held of small and low account and of no name or reputation as to be more honourable and greater in the world than others.  For Thy will and the love of Thine honour ought to go before all things, and to please and comfort him more, than all benefits that are given or may be given to himself. (1) Acts v. 41. CHAPTER XXIII Of four things which bring great peace "My Son, now will I teach thee the way of peace and of true liberty." 2. Do, O my Lord, as Thou sayest, for this is pleasing unto me to hear. 3. "Strive, My Son, to do another's will rather than thine own. Choose always to have less rather than more.  Seek always after the lowest place, and to be subject to all.  Wish always and pray that the will of God be fulfilled in thee.  Behold, such a man as this entereth into the inheritance of peace and quietness." 4. O my Lord, this Thy short discourse hath in itself much of perfectness.  It is short in words but full of meaning, and abundant in fruit.  For if it were possible that I should fully keep it, disturbance would not so easily arise within me.  For as often as I feel myself disquieted and weighed down, I find myself to have gone back from this teaching.  But Thou, Who art Almighty, and always lovest progress in the soul, vouchsafe more grace, that I may be enabled to fulfil Thy exhortation, and work out my salvation. 		A PRAYER AGAINST EVIL THOUGHTS 5. O Lord my God, be not Thou far from me, my God, haste Thee to help me,(1) for many thoughts and great fears have risen up against me, afflicting my soul.  How shall I pass through them unhurt? how shall I break through them? 6. "I," saith He, "will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight."(2)  I will open the prison doors, and reveal to thee the secret places. 7. Do, Lord, as Thou sayest; and let all evil thoughts fly away before Thy face.  This is my hope and my only comfort, to fly unto Thee in all tribulation, to hope in Thee, to call upon Thee from my heart and patiently wait for Thy loving kindness. A PRAYER FOR ENLIGHTENMENT OF THE MIND 8. Enlighten me, Blessed Jesus, with the brightness of Thy inner light, and cast forth all darkness from the habitation of my heart.  Restrain my many wandering thoughts, and carry away the temptations which strive to do me hurt.  Fight Thou mightily for me, and drive forth the evil beasts, so call I alluring lusts, that peace may be within Thy walls and plenteousness of praise within Thy palaces,(3) even in my pure conscience.  Command Thou the winds and the storms, say unto the sea, "Be still," say unto the stormy wind, "Hold thy peace," so shall there be a great calm. 9. Oh send forth Thy light and Thy truth,(4) that they may shine upon the earth; for I am but earth without form and void until Thou give me light.  Pour forth Thy grace from above; water my heart with the dew of heaven; give the waters of devotion to water the face of the earth, and cause it to bring forth good and perfect fruit.  Lift up my mind which is oppressed with the weight of sins, and raise my whole desire to heavenly things; that having tasted the sweetness of the happiness which is from above, it may take no pleasure in thinking of things of earth. 10. Draw me and deliver me from every unstable comfort of creatures, for no created thing is able to satisfy my desire and to give me comfort.  Join me to Thyself by the inseparable bond of love, for Thou alone art sufficient to him that loveth Thee, and without Thee all things are vain toys. (1) Psalm lxxi. 12.   (2) Isaiah xlv. 2.   (3) Psalm cxxii. 7. (4) Psalm xliii. 3. CHAPTER XXIV Of avoiding of curious inquiry into the life of another "My Son, be not curious, nor trouble thyself with vain cares. What is that to thee?  Follow thou Me.(1)  For what is it to thee whether a man be this or that, or say or do thus or thus?  Thou hast no need to answer for others, but thou must give an answer for thyself.  Why therefore dost thou entangle thyself?  Behold, I know all men, and I behold all things which are done under the sun; and I know how it standeth with each one, what he thinketh, what he willeth, and to what end his thoughts reach.  All things therefore are to be committed to Me; watch thou thyself in godly peace, and leave him who is unquiet to be unquiet as he will. Whatsoever he shall do or say, shall come unto him, for he cannot deceive Me. 2. "Trouble not thyself about the shadow of a great name, nor about the friendship of many, nor about the love of men towards thee.  For these things beget distraction and great sorrows of heart.  My word should speak freely unto thee, and I would reveal secrets, if only thou didst diligently look for My appearing, and didst open unto Me the gates of thy heart.  Be sober and watch unto prayer,(2) and humble thyself in all things." (1) John xxi. 12.   (2) 1 Peter iv. 7. CHAPTER XXV Wherein firm peace of heart and true profit consist "My Son, I have said, Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you, not as the world giveth give I unto you.(1)  All men desire peace, but all do not care for the things which belong unto true peace.  My peace is with the humble and lowly in heart. Thy peace shall be in much patience.  If thou heardest Me, and didst follow My voice, thou shouldest enjoy much peace." 2. What then shall I do, Lord? 3. "In everything take heed to thyself what thou doest, and what thou sayest; and direct all thy purpose to this, that thou please Me alone, and desire or seek nothing apart from Me.  But, moreover, judge nothing rashly concerning the words or deeds of others, nor meddle with matters which are not committed to thee; and it may be that thou shalt be disturbed little or rarely.  Yet never to feel any disquiet, nor to suffer any pain of heart or body, this belongeth not to the present life, but is the state of eternal rest.  Therefore count not thyself to have found true peace, if thou hast felt no grief; nor that then all is well if thou hast no adversary; nor that this is perfect if all things fall out according to thy desire.  Nor then reckon thyself to be anything great, or think that thou art specially beloved, if thou art in a state of great fervour and sweetness of spirit; for not by these things is the true lover of virtue known, nor in them doth the profit and perfection of man consist." 4. In what then, Lord? 5. "In offering thyself with all thy heart to the Divine Will, in not seeking the things which are thine own, whether great or small, whether temporal or eternal; so that thou remain with the same steady countenance in giving of thanks between prosperity and adversity, weighing all things in an equal balance.  If thou be so brave and long-suffering in hope that when inward comfort is taken from thee, thou even prepare thy heart for the more endurance, and justify not thyself, as though thou oughtest not to suffer these heavy things, but dost justify Me in all things that I appoint, and dost bless My Holy Name, then dost thou walk in the true and right way of peace, and shalt have a sure hope that thou shalt again behold My face with joy.  For if thou come to an utter contempt of thyself, know that then thou shalt enjoy abundance of peace, as much as is possible where thou art but a wayfaring man." (1) John xiv. 27. CHAPTER XXVI Of the exaltation of a free spirit, which humble prayer more deserveth than doth frequent reading Lord, this is the work of a perfect man, never to slacken his mind from attention to heavenly things, and among many cares to pass along as it were without care, not after the manner of one indifferent, but rather with the privilege of a free mind, cleaving to no creature with inordinate affection. 2. I beseech Thee, my most merciful Lord God, preserve me from the cares of this life, lest I become too much entangled; from many necessities of the body, lest I be taken captive by pleasure; from all obstacles of the spirit, lest I be broken and cast down with cares.  I say not from those things which the vanity of the world goeth about after with all eagerness, but from those miseries, which by the universal curse of mortality weigh down and hold back the soul of thy servant in punishment, that it cannot enter into liberty of spirit, so often as it would. 3. O my God, sweetness unspeakable, turn into bitterness all my fleshly consolation, which draweth me away from the love of eternal things, and wickedly allureth toward itself by setting before me some present delight.  Let not, O my God, let not flesh and blood prevail over me, let not the world and its short glory deceive me, let not the devil and his craftiness supplant me. Give me courage to resist, patience to endure, constancy to persevere. Grant, in place of all consolations of the world, the most sweet unction of Thy Spirit, and in place of carnal love, pour into me the love of Thy Name. 4. Behold, food and drink and clothing, and all the other needs appertaining to the support of the body, are burdensome to the devout spirit.  Grant that I may use such things with moderation, and that I be not entangled with inordinate affection for them. To cast away all these things is not lawful, because nature must be sustained, but to require superfluities and things which merely minister delight, the holy law forbiddeth; for otherwise the flesh would wax insolent against the spirit.  In all these things, I beseech Thee, let Thy hand guide and teach me, that I in no way exceed. CHAPTER XXVII That personal love greatly hindereth from the highest good "My Son, thou must give all for all, and be nothing of thine own. Know thou that the love of thyself is more hurtful to thee than anything in the world.  According to the love and inclination which thou hast, everything more or less cleaveth to thee.  If thy love be pure, sincere, well-regulated, thou shalt not be in captivity to anything.  Do not covet what thou mayest not have; do not have what is able to hinder thee, and to rob thee of inward liberty.  It is wonderful that thou committest not thyself to Me from the very bottom of thy heart, with all things which thou canst desire or have. 2. "Why art thou consumed with vain sorrow?  Why art thou wearied with superfluous cares?  Stand thou by My good pleasure, and thou shalt suffer no loss.  If thou seekest after this or that, and wilt be here or there, according to thine own advantage or the fulfilling of thine own pleasure, thou shalt never be in quiet, nor free from care, because in everything somewhat will be found lacking, and everywhere there will be somebody who opposeth thee. 3. "Therefore it is not gaining or multiplying of this thing or that which advantageth thee, but rather the despising it and cutting it by the root out of thy heart; which thou must not only understand of money and riches, but of the desire after honour and vain praise, things which all pass away with the world.  The place availeth little if the spirit of devotion is wanting; nor shall that peace stand long which is sought from abroad, if the state of thy heart is without the true foundation, that is, if it abide not in Me.  Thou mayest change, but thou canst not better thyself; for when occasion ariseth and is accepted thou shalt find what thou didst fly from, yea more." A PRAYER FOR CLEANSING OF THE HEART AND FOR HEAVENLY WISDOM 4. Strengthen me, O God, by the grace of Thy Holy Spirit.  Give me virtue to be strengthened with might in the inner man, and to free my heart from all fruitless care and trouble, and that I be not drawn away by various desires after any things whatsoever, whether of little value or great, but that I may look upon all as passing away, and myself as passing away with them; because there is no profit under the sun, and all is vanity and vexation of spirit.(1)  Oh how wise is he that considereth thus! 5. Give me, O Lord, heavenly wisdom, that I may learn to seek Thee above all things and to find Thee; to relish Thee above all things and to love Thee; and to understand all other things, even as they are, according to the order of Thy wisdom.  Grant me prudently to avoid the flatterer, and patiently to bear with him that opposeth me; for this is great wisdom, not to be carried by every wind of words, nor to give ear to the wicked flattering Siren; for thus do we go safely on in the way we have begun. (1) Ecclesiastes ii. 11. CHAPTER XXVIII Against the tongues of detractors "My Son, take it not sadly to heart, if any think ill of thee, and say of thee what thou art unwilling to hear.  Thou oughtest to think worse of thyself, and to believe no man weaker than thyself.  If thou walkest inwardly, thou wilt not weigh flying words above their value.  It is no small prudence to keep silence in an evil time and to turn inwardly unto Me, and not to be troubled by human judgment. 2. "Let not thy peace depend upon the word of men; for whether they judge well or ill of thee, thou art not therefore any other man than thyself.  Where is true peace or true glory?  Is it not in Me?  And he who seeketh not to please men, nor feareth to displease, shall enjoy abundant peace.  From inordinate love and vain fear ariseth all disquietude of heart, and all distraction of the senses." CHAPTER XXIX How when tribulation cometh we must call upon and bless God Blessed be thy name, O Lord, for evermore, who hast willed this temptation and trouble to come upon me.  I cannot escape it, but have need to flee unto Thee, that Thou mayest succour me and turn it unto me for good.  Lord, now am I in tribulation, and it is not well within my heart, but I am sore vexed by the suffering which lieth upon me.  And now, O dear Father, what shall I say? I am taken among the snares.  Save me from this hour, but for this cause came I unto this hour,(1) that Thou mightest be glorified when I am deeply humbled and am delivered through Thee. Let it be Thy pleasure to deliver me;(2) for what can I do who am poor, and without Thee whither shall I go?  Give patience this time also.  Help me, O Lord my God, and I will not fear how much soever I be weighed down. 2. And now amid these things what shall I say?  Lord, Thy will be done.  I have well deserved to be troubled and weighed down. Therefore I ought to bear, would that it be with patience, until the tempest be overpast and comfort return.  Yet is Thine omnipotent arm able also to take this temptation away from me, and to lessen its power that I fall not utterly under it, even as many a time past thou has helped me, O God, my merciful God.  And as much as this deliverance is difficult to me, so much is it easy to Thee, O right hand of the most Highest. (1) John xii. 27.   (2) Psalm xl. 16. CHAPTER XXX Of seeking divine help, and the confidence of obtaining grace "My Son, I the Lord am a stronghold in the day of trouble.(1) Come unto Me, when it is not well with thee. "This it is which chiefly hindereth heavenly consolation, that thou too slowly betakest thyself unto prayer.  For before thou earnestly seekest unto Me, thou dost first seek after many means of comfort, and refresheth thyself in outward things: so it cometh to pass that all things profit thee but little until thou learn that it is I who deliver those who trust in Me; neither beside Me is there any strong help, nor profitable counsel, nor enduring remedy.  But now, recovering courage after the tempest, grow thou strong in the light of My mercies, for I am nigh, saith the Lord, that I may restore all things not only as they were at the first, but also abundantly and one upon another. 2. "For is anything too hard for Me, or shall I be like unto one who saith and doeth not?  Where is thy faith?  Stand fast and with perseverance.  Be long-suffering and strong.  Consolation will come unto thee in its due season.  Wait for Me; yea, wait; I will come and heal thee.  It is temptation which vexeth thee, and a vain fear which terrifieth thee.  What doth care about future events bring thee, save sorrow upon sorrow?  Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.(2)  It is vain and useless to be disturbed or lifted up about future things which perhaps will never come. 3. "But it is the nature of man to be deceived by fancies of this sort, and it is a sign of a mind which is still weak to be so easily drawn away at the suggestion of the enemy.  For he careth not whether he deceive and beguile by true means or false; whether he throw thee down by the love of the present or fear of the future.  Therefore let not thy heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.  Believe in Me, and put thy trust in My mercy.(3) When thou thinkest thyself far removed from Me, I am often the nearer.  When thou reckonest that almost all is lost, then often is greater opportunity of gain at hand.  All is not lost when something goeth contrary to thy wishes.  Thou oughtest not to judge according to present feeling, nor so to take or give way to any grief which befalleth thee, as if all hope of escape were taken away. 4. "Think not thyself totally abandoned, although for the time I have sent to thee some tribulation, or have even withdrawn some cherished consolation; for this is the way to the Kingdom of Heaven.  And without doubt it is better for thee and for all My other servants, that ye should be proved by adversities, than that ye should have all things as ye would.  I know thy hidden thoughts: and that it is very needful for thy soul's health that sometimes thou be left without relish, lest perchance thou be lifted up by prosperity, and desirous to please thyself in that which thou art not.  What I have given I am able to take away, and to restore again at My good pleasure. 5. "When I shall have given, it is Mine; when I shall have taken away, I have not taken what is thine; for every good gift and every perfect gift(4) is from me.  If I shall have sent upon thee grief or any vexation, be not angry, nor let thy heart be sad; I am able quickly to lift thee up and to change every burden into joy.  But I am just and greatly to be praised, when I do thus unto thee. 6. "If thou rightly consider, and look upon it with truth, thou oughtest never to be so sadly cast down because of adversity, but rather shouldst rejoice and give thanks; yea, verily to count it the highest joy that I afflict thee with sorrows and spare thee not.  As My Father hath loved Me, so love I you;(5) thus have I spoken unto My beloved disciples: whom I sent forth not unto worldly joys, but to great strivings; not unto honours, but unto contempt; not unto ease, but to labours; not unto rest, but to bring forth much fruit with patience.  My son, remember these words." (1) Nahum i. 7.   (2) Matthew vi. 34. (3) John xiv. 27; Psalm xiii. 5.   (4) James i. 17. (5) John xv. 9. CHAPTER XXXI Of the neglect of every creature, that the Creator may be found O Lord, I still need more grace, if I would arrive where neither man nor any other creature may hinder me.  For so long as anything keepeth me back, I cannot freely fly unto Thee.  He desired eagerly thus to fly, who cried, saying, Oh that I had wings like a dove, for then would I flee away and be at rest. What is more peaceful than the single eye?  And what more free than he that desireth nothing upon earth?  Therefore must a man rise above every creature, and perfectly forsake himself, and with abstracted mind to stand and behold that Thou, the Creator of all things, hast among Thy creatures nothing like unto Thyself.  And except a man be freed from all creatures, he will not be able to reach freely after Divine things.  Therefore few are found who give themselves to contemplation, because few know how to separate themselves entirely from perishing and created things. 2. For this much grace is necessary, which may lift up the soul and raise it above itself.  And except a man be lifted up in the spirit, and freed from all creatures, and altogether united to God, whatsoever he knoweth, whatsoever even he hath, it mattereth but little.  He who esteemeth anything great save the one only incomprehensible, eternal, good, shall long time be little and lie low.  For whatsoever is not God is nothing, and ought to be counted for nothing.  Great is the difference between a godly man, illuminated with wisdom, and a scholar learned in knowledge and given to books.  Far nobler is that doctrine which floweth down from the divine fulness above, than that which is acquired laboriously by human study. 3. Many are found who desire contemplation, but they do not strive to practice those things which are required thereunto.  It is also a great impediment, that much is made of symbols and external signs, and too little of thorough mortification.  I know not how it is, and by what spirit we are led, and what we who would be deemed spiritual are aiming at, that we give so great labour and so eager solicitude for transitory and worthless things, and scarcely ever gather our senses together to think at all of our inward condition. 4. Ah, me!  Forthwith after a little recollection we rush out of doors, and do not subject our actions to a strict examination. Where our affections are set we take no heed, and we weep not that all things belonging to us are so defiled.  For because all flesh had corrupted itself upon the earth, the great deluge came. Since therefore our inmost affections are very corrupt, it followeth of necessity that our actions also are corrupt, being the index of a deficient inward strength.  Out of a pure heart proceedeth the fruit of good living. 5. We demand, how much a man hath done; but from how much virtue he acted, is not so narrowly considered.  We ask if he be strong, rich, handsome, clever, whether he is a good writer, good singer, good workman; but how poor he may be in spirit, how patient and gentle, how devout and meditative, on these things many are silent.  Nature looketh upon the outward appearance of a man, grace turneth its thought to the heart.  The former frequently judgeth amiss; the latter trusteth in God, that it may not be deceived. CHAPTER XXXII Of self-denial and the casting away all selfishness "My Son, thou canst not possess perfect liberty unless thou altogether deny thyself.  All they are enslaved who are possessors of riches, they who love themselves, the selfish, the curious, the restless; those who ever seek after soft things, and not after the things of Jesus Christ; those who continually plan and devise that which will not stand.  For whatsoever cometh not of God shall perish.  Hold fast the short and complete saying, 'Renounce all things, and thou shalt find all things; give up thy lust, and thou shalt find rest.'  Dwell upon this in thy mind, and when thou art full of it, thou shalt understand all things." 2. O Lord, this is not the work of a day, nor children's play; verily in this short saying is enclosed all the perfection of the religious. 3. "My son, thou oughtest not to be turned aside, nor immediately cast down, because thou hast heard the way of the perfect. Rather oughtest thou to be provoked to higher aims, and at the least to long after the desire thereof.  Oh that it were so with thee, and that thou hadst come to this, that thou wert not a lover of thine own self, but wert ready always to My nod, and to his whom I have placed over thee as thy father.  Then shouldest thou please Me exceedingly, and all thy life should go on in joy and peace.  Thou hast still many things to renounce, which if thou resign not utterly to Me, thou shalt not gain what thou seekest. I counsel thee to buy of Me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich,(1) that is heavenly wisdom, which despiseth all base things.  Put away from thee earthly wisdom, and all pleasure, whether common to men, or thine own. 4. "I tell thee that thou must buy vile things with those which are costly and great in the esteem of men.  For wonderfully vile and small, and almost given up to forgetfulness, doth true heavenly wisdom appear, which thinketh not high things of itself, nor seeketh to be magnified upon the earth; many honour it with their lips, but in heart are far from it; it is indeed the precious pearl, which is hidden from many." (1) Revelation iii. 18. CHAPTER XXXIII Of instability of the heart, and of directing the aim towards God "My Son, trust not thy feeling, for that which is now will be quickly changed into somewhat else.  As long as thou livest thou art subject to change, howsoever unwilling; so that thou art found now joyful, now sad; now at peace, now disquieted; now devout, now indevout; now studious, now careless; now sad, now cheerful.  But the wise man, and he who is truly learned in spirit, standeth above these changeable things, attentive not to what he may feel in himself, or from what quarter the wind may blow, but that the whole intent of his mind may carry him on to the due and much-desired end.  For thus will he be able to remain one and the same and unshaken, the single eye of his desire being steadfastly fixed, through the manifold changes of the world, upon Me. 2. "But according as the eye of intention be the more pure, even so will a man make his way steadfastly through the manifold storms.  But in many the eye of pure intention waxeth dim; for it quickly resteth itself upon anything pleasant which occurreth, and rarely is any man found altogether free from the blemish of self-seeking.  So the Jews of old came to Bethany, to the house of Martha and Mary, that they might see not Jesus, but Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.(1)  Therefore must the eye of the intention be cleansed, that it may be single and right, and above all things which come in its way, may be directed unto Me." (1) John xii. 9. CHAPTER XXXIV That to him who loveth God is sweet above all things and in all things Behold, God is mine, and all things are mine!  What will I more, and what more happy thing can I desire?  O delightsome and sweet world! that is, to him that loveth the Word, not the world, neither the things that are in the world.(1)  My God, my all! To him that understandeth, that word sufficeth, and to repeat it often is pleasing to him that loveth it.  When Thou art present all things are pleasant; when Thou art absent, all things are wearisome.  Thou makest the heart to be at rest, givest it deep peace and festal joy.  Thou makest it to think rightly in every matter, and in every matter to give Thee praise; neither can anything please long without Thee but if it would be pleasant and of sweet savour, Thy grace must be there, and it is Thy wisdom which must give unto it a sweet savour. 2. To him who tasteth Thee, what can be distasteful?  And to him who tasteth Thee not, what is there which can make him joyous? But the worldly wise, and they who enjoy the flesh, these fail in Thy wisdom; for in the wisdom of the world is found utter vanity, and to be carnally minded is death.  But they who follow after Thee through contempt of worldly things, and mortification of the flesh, are found to be truly wise because they are carried from vanity to verity, from the flesh to the spirit.  They taste that the Lord is good, and whatsoever good they find in creatures, they count it all unto the praise of the Creator.  Unlike, yea, very unlike is the enjoyment of the Creator to enjoyment of the Creature, the enjoyment of eternity and of time, of light uncreated and of light reflected. 3. O Light everlasting, surpassing all created lights, dart down Thy ray from on high which shall pierce the inmost depths of my heart.  Give purity, joy, clearness, life to my spirit that with all its powers it may cleave unto Thee with rapture passing man's understanding.  Oh when shall that blessed and longed-for time come when Thou shalt satisfy me with Thy presence, and be unto me All in all?  So long as this is delayed, my joy shall not be full.  Still, ah me! the old man liveth in me: he is not yet all crucified, not yet quite dead; still he lusteth fiercely against the spirit, wageth inward wars, nor suffereth the soul's kingdom to be in peace. 4. But Thou who rulest the raging of the sea, and stillest the waves thereof when they arise, rise up and help me.  Scatter the people that delight in war.(2)  Destroy them by Thy power.  Show forth, I beseech Thee, Thy might, and let Thy right hand be glorified, for I have no hope, no refuge, save in Thee, O Lord my God. (1) 1 John ii. 15.   (2) Psalm lxviii. 30. CHAPTER XXXV That there is no security against temptation in this life "My Son, thou art never secure in this life, but thy spiritual armour will always be needful for thee as long as thou livest. Thou dwellest among foes, and art attacked on the right hand and on the left.  If therefore thou use not on all sides the shield of patience, thou wilt not remain long unwounded.  Above all, if thou keep not thy heart fixed upon Me with steadfast purpose to bear all things for My sake, thou shalt not be able to bear the fierceness of the attack, nor to attain to the victory of the blessed.  Therefore must thou struggle bravely all thy life through, and put forth a strong hand against those things which oppose thee.  For to him that overcometh is the hidden manna given,(1) but great misery is reserved for the slothful. 2. "If thou seek rest in this life, how then wilt thou attain unto the rest which is eternal?  Set not thyself to attain much rest, but much patience.  Seek the true peace, not in earth but in heaven, not in man nor in any created thing, but in God alone. For the love of God thou must willingly undergo all things, whether labours or sorrows, temptations, vexations, anxieties, necessities, infirmities, injuries, gainsayings, rebukes, humiliations, confusions, corrections, despisings; these things help unto virtue, these things prove the scholar of Christ; these things fashion the heavenly crown.  I will give thee an eternal reward for short labour, and infinite glory for transient shame. 3. "Thinkest thou that thou shalt always have spiritual consolations at thy will?  My Saints had never such, but instead thereof manifold griefs, and divers temptations, and heavy desolations.  But patiently they bore themselves in all, and trusted in God more than in themselves, knowing that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.(2)  Wouldst thou have that immediately which many have hardly attained unto after many tears and hard labours?  Wait for the Lord, quit thyself like a man and be strong; be not faint-hearted, nor go aside from Me, but constantly devote thy body and soul to the glory of God. I will reward thee plenteously, I will be with thee in trouble."(3) (1) Revelation ii. 17.   (2) Romans viii. 17. (3) Psalm xci. 15. CHAPTER XXXVI Against vain judgments of men "My Son, anchor thy soul firmly upon God, and fear not man's judgment, when conscience pronounceth thee pious and innocent. It is good and blessed thus to suffer; nor will it be grievous to the heart which is humble, and which trusteth in God more than in itself.  Many men have many opinions, and therefore little trust is to be placed in them.  But moreover it is impossible to please all.  Although Paul studied to please all men in the Lord, and to become all things to all men,(1) yet nevertheless with him it was a very small thing that he should be judged by man's judgment."(2) 2. He laboured abundantly, as much as in him lay, for the building up and the salvation of others; but he could not avoid being sometimes judged and despised by others.  Therefore he committed all to God, who knew all, and by patience and humility defended himself against evil speakers, or foolish and false thinkers, and those who accused him according to their pleasure. Nevertheless, from time to time he replied, lest his silence should become a stumbling-block to those who were weak. 3. "Who art thou, that thou shouldst be afraid of a man that shall die?  To-day he is, and to-morrow his place is not found. Fear God and thou shalt not quail before the terrors of men. What can any man do against thee by words or deeds?  He hurteth himself more than thee, nor shall he escape the judgment of God, whosoever he may be.  Have thou God before thine eyes, and do not contend with fretful words.  And if for the present thou seem to give way, and to suffer confusion which thou hast not deserved, be not angry at this, nor by impatience diminish thy reward; but rather look up to Me in heaven, for I am able to deliver thee from all confusion and hurt, and to render to every man according to his works." (1) 1 Corinthians ix. 22.   (2) 1 Corinthians iv. 3. CHAPTER XXXVII Of pure and entire resignation of self, for the obtaining liberty of heart "My Son, lose thyself and thou shalt find Me.  Stand still without all choosing and all thought of self, and thou shalt ever be a gainer.  For more grace shall be added to thee, as soon as thou resignest thyself, and so long as thou dost not turn back to take thyself again." 2. O Lord, how often shall I resign myself, and in what things shall I lose myself? 3. "Always; every hour: in that which is little, and in that which is great.  I make no exception, but will that thou be found naked in all things. Otherwise how canst thou be Mine and I thine, unless thou be inwardly and outwardly free from every will of thine own?  The sooner thou dost this, the better shall it be with thee; and the more fully and sincerely, the more thou shalt please Me, and the more abundantly shalt thou be rewarded. 4. "Some resign themselves, but with certain reservations, for they do not fully trust in God, therefore they think that they have some provision to make for themselves.  Some again at first offer everything; but afterwards being pressed by temptation they return to their own devices, and thus make no progress in virtue. They will not attain to the true liberty of a pure heart, nor to the grace of My sweet companionship, unless they first entirely resign themselves and daily offer themselves up as a sacrifice; without this the union which bringeth forth fruit standeth not nor will stand. 5. "Many a time I have said unto thee, and now say again, Give thyself up, resign thyself, and thou shalt have great inward peace.  Give all for all; demand nothing, ask nothing in return; stand simply and with no hesitation in Me, and thou shalt possess Me.  Thou shalt have liberty of heart, and the darkness shall not overwhelm thee.  For this strive thou, pray for it, long after it, that thou mayest be delivered from all possession of thyself, and nakedly follow Jesus who was made naked for thee; mayest die unto thyself and live eternally to Me.  Then shall all vain fancies disappear, all evil disturbings, and superfluous cares. Then also shall immoderate fear depart from thee, and inordinate love shall die." CHAPTER XXXVIII Of a good government in external things, and of having recourse to God in dangers "My Son, for this thou must diligently make thy endeavour, that in every place and outward action or occupation thou mayest be free within, and have power over thyself; and that all things be under thee, not thou under them; that thou be master and ruler of thy actions, not a slave or hireling, but rather a free and true Hebrew, entering into the lot and the liberty of the children of God, who stand above the present and look upon the eternal, who with the left eye behold things transitory, and with the right things heavenly; whom temporal things draw not to cleave unto, but who rather draw temporal things to do them good service, even as they were ordained of God to do, and appointed by the Master Workman, who hath left nought in His creation without aim and end. 2. "And if in any chance of life thou stand not in outward appearances, nor judgest things which are seen and heard by the fleshly sense, but straightway in every cause enterest with Moses into the tabernacle to ask counsel of God; thou shalt hear a divine response and come forth instructed concerning many things that are and shall be.  For always Moses had recourse to the tabernacle for the solving of all doubts and questionings; and fled to the help of prayer to be delivered from the dangers and evil deeds of men.  Thus also oughtest thou to fly to the secret chamber of thy heart, and earnestly implore the divine succour. For this cause we read that Joshua and the children of Israel were deceived by the Gibeonites, that they asked not counsel at the mouth of the Lord,(1) but being too ready to listen to fair speeches, were deceived by pretended piety." (1) Joshua ix. 14. CHAPTER XXXIX That man must not be immersed in business "My Son, always commit thy cause to Me; I will dispose it aright in due time.  Wait for My arrangement of it, and then thou shalt find it for thy profit." 2. O Lord, right freely I commit all things to Thee; for my planning can profit but little.  Oh that I did not dwell so much on future events, but could offer myself altogether to Thy pleasures without delay. 3. "My Son, a man often striveth vehemently after somewhat which he desireth; but when he hath obtained it he beginneth to be of another mind, because his affections towards it are not lasting, but rather rush on from one thing to another. Therefore it is not really a small thing, when in small things we resist self." 4. The true progress of man lieth in self-denial, and a man who denieth himself is free and safe.  But the old enemy, opposer of all good things, ceaseth not from temptation; but day and night setteth his wicked snares, if haply he may be able to entrap the unwary.  Watch and pray, saith the Lord, lest ye enter into temptation.(1) (1) Matthew xxvi. 41. CHAPTER XL That man hath no good in himself, and nothing whereof to glory Lord, what is man that Thou art mindful of him, or the son of man that Thou visitest him?(1)  What hath man deserved, that Thou shouldest bestow thy favour upon him?  Lord, what cause can I have of complaint, if Thou forsake me?  Or what can I justly allege, if Thou refuse to hear my petition?  Of a truth, this I may truly think and say, Lord, I am nothing, I have nothing that is good of myself, but I fall short in all things, and ever tend unto nothing.  And unless I am helped by Thee and inwardly supported, I become altogether lukewarm and reckless. 2. But Thou, O Lord, art always the same, and endurest for ever, always good, righteous, and holy; doing all things well, righteously, and holily, and disposing all in Thy wisdom.  But I who am more ready to go forward than backward, never continue in one stay, because changes sevenfold pass over me.  Yet it quickly becometh better when it so pleaseth Thee, and Thou puttest forth Thy hand to help me; because Thou alone canst aid without help of man, and canst so strengthen me that my countenance shall be no more changed, but my heart shall be turned to Thee, and rest in Thee alone. 3. Wherefore, if I but knew well how to reject all human consolations, whether for the sake of gaining devotion, or because of the necessity by which I was compelled to seek Thee, seeing there is no man who can comfort me; then could I worthily trust in Thy grace, and rejoice in the gift of new consolation. 4. Thanks be to Thee, from whom all cometh, whensoever it goeth well with me!  But I am vanity and nothing in Thy sight, a man inconstant and weak.  What then have I whereof to glory, or why do I long to be held in honour?  Is it not for nought?  This also is utterly vain.  Verily vain glory is an evil plague, the greatest of vanities, because it draweth us away from the true glory, and robbeth us of heavenly grace.  For whilst a man pleaseth himself he displeaseth Thee; whilst he gapeth after the praises of man, he is deprived of true virtues. 5. But true glory and holy rejoicing lieth in glorying in Thee and not in self; in rejoicing in Thy Name, not in our own virtue; in not taking delight in any creature, save only for Thy sake. Let thy Name, not mine be praised; let Thy work, not mine be magnified; let Thy holy Name be blessed, but to me let nought be given of the praises of men.  Thou art my glory, Thou art the joy of my heart.  In Thee will I make my boast and be glad all the day long, but for myself let me not glory save only in my infirmities.(2) 6. Let the Jews seek the honour which cometh from one another; but I will ask for that which cometh from God only.(3)  Truly all human glory, all temporal honour, all worldly exultation, compared to Thy eternal glory, is but vanity and folly.  O God my Truth and my Mercy, Blessed Trinity, to Thee alone be all praise, honour, power, and glory for ever and for ever.  Amen. (1) Psalm viii. 4.   (2) 2 Corinthians xii. 5. (3) John v. 44. CHAPTER XLI Of contempt of all temporal honour "My Son, make it no matter of thine, if thou see others honoured and exalted, and thyself despised and humbled.  Lift up thine heart to Me in heaven, and then the contempt of men upon earth will not make thee sad." 2. O Lord, we are in blindness, and are quickly seduced by vanity.  If I look rightly within myself, never was injury done unto me by any creature, and therefore I have nought whereof to complain before Thee.  But because I have many times and grievously sinned against Thee, all creatures do justly take arms against me.  Therefore to me confusion and contempt are justly due, but to Thee praise and honour and glory.  And except I dispose myself for this, namely, to be willing that every creature should despise and desert me, and that I should be esteemed altogether as nothing, I cannot be inwardly filled with peace and strength, nor spiritually enlightened, nor fully united to Thee. CHAPTER XLII That our peace is not to be placed in men "My Son, if thou set thy peace on any person because thou hast high opinion of him, and art familiar with him, thou shalt be unstable and entangled.  But if thou betake thyself to the ever-living and abiding Truth, the desertion or death of a friend shall not make thee sad.  In Me ought the love of thy friend to subsist, and for My sake is every one to be loved, whosoever he be, who appeareth to thee good, and is very dear to thee in this life.  Without Me friendship hath no strength or endurance, neither is that love true and pure, which I unite not.  Thou oughtest to be so dead to such affections of beloved friends, that as far as in thee lieth, thou wouldst rather choose to be without any companionship of men.  The nearer a man approacheth to God, the further he recedeth from all earthly solace.  The deeper also he descendeth into himself, and the viler he appeareth in his own eyes, the higher he ascendeth towards God. 2. "But he who attributeth anything good to himself, hindereth the grace of God from coming to him, because the grace of the Holy Ghost ever seeketh the humble heart.  If thou couldst make thyself utterly nothing, and empty thyself of the love of every creature, then should it be My part to overflow unto thee with great grace.  When thou settest thine eyes upon creatures, the face of the Creator is withdrawn from thee.  Learn in all things to conquer thyself for thy Creator's sake, then shalt thou be able to attain unto divine knowledge.  How small soever anything be, if it be loved and regarded inordinately, it holdeth us back from the highest good, and corrupteth." CHAPTER XLIII Against vain and worldly knowledge "My Son, let not the fair and subtle sayings of men move thee. For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.(1)  Give ear to My words, for they kindle the heart and enlighten the mind, they bring contrition, and they supply manifold consolations. Never read thou the word that thou mayest appear more learned or wise; but study for the mortification of thy sins, for this will be far more profitable for thee than the knowledge of many difficult questions. 2. "When thou hast read and learned many things, thou must always return to one first principle.  I am He that teacheth man knowledge,(2) and I give unto babes clearer knowledge than can be taught by man.  He to whom I speak will be quickly wise and shall grow much in the spirit.  Woe unto them who inquire into many curious questions from men, and take little heed concerning the way of My service.  The time will come when Christ will appear, the Master of masters, the Lord of the Angels, to hear the lessons of all, that is to examine the consciences of each one.  And then will He search Jerusalem with candles,(3) and the hidden things of darkness(4) shall be made manifest, and the arguings of tongues shall be silent. 3. "I am He who in an instant lift up the humble spirit, to learn more reasonings of the Eternal Truth, than if a man had studied ten years in the schools.  I teach without noise of words, without confusion of opinions, without striving after honour, without clash of arguments.  I am He who teach men to despise earthly things, to loathe things present, to seek things heavenly, to enjoy things eternal, to flee honours, to endure offences, to place all hope in Me, to desire nothing apart from Me, and above all things to love Me ardently. 4. "For there was one, who by loving Me from the bottom of his heart, learned divine things, and spake things that were wonderful; he profited more by forsaking all things than by studying subtleties.  But to some I speak common things, to others special; to some I appear gently in signs and figures, and again to some I reveal mysteries in much light.  The voice of books is one, but it informeth not all alike; because I inwardly am the Teacher of truth, the Searcher of the heart, the Discerner of the thoughts, the Mover of actions, distributing to each man, as I judge meet." (1) 1 Corinthians iv. 20.   (2) Psalm xciv. 10. (3) Zephaniah i. 12.   (4) 1 Corinthians iv. 5. CHAPTER XLIV Of not troubling ourselves about outward things "My Son, in many things it behoveth thee to be ignorant, and to esteem thyself as one dead upon the earth, and as one to whom the whole world is crucified.  Many things also thou must pass by with deaf ear, and must rather think upon those things which belong unto thy peace.  It is more profitable to turn away thine eyes from those things that displease, and to leave each man to his own opinion, than to give thyself to discourses of strife. If thou stand well with God and hast His judgment in thy mind, thou wilt verily easily bear to be as one conquered." 2. O Lord, to what have we come?  Behold a temporal loss is mourned over; for a trifling gain we labour and hurry; and spiritual loss passeth away into forgetfulness, and we rarely recover it.  That which profiteth little or nothing is looked after, and that which is altogether necessary is negligently passed by; because the whole man slideth away to outward things, and unless he quickly recovereth himself in outward things he willingly lieth down. CHAPTER XLV That we must not believe everyone, and that we are prone to fall in our words Lord, be thou my help in trouble, for vain is the help of man.(1) How often have I failed to find faithfulness, where I thought I possessed it.  How many times I have found it where I least expected.  Vain therefore is hope in men, but the salvation of the just, O God, is in Thee.  Blessed be thou, O Lord my God, in all things which happen unto us.  We are weak and unstable, we are quickly deceived and quite changed. 2. Who is the man who is able to keep himself so warily and circumspectly as not sometimes to come into some snare of perplexity?  But he who trusteth in Thee, O Lord, and seeketh Thee with an unfeigned heart, doth not so easily slip.  And if he fall into any tribulation, howsoever he may be entangled, yet very quickly he shall be delivered through Thee, or by Thee shall be comforted, because Thou wilt not forsake him that trusteth in Thee unto the end.  A friend who continueth faithful in all the distresses of his friend is rare to be found.  Thou, O Lord, Thou alone art most faithful in all things, and there is none other like unto Thee. 3. Oh, how truly wise was that holy soul which said, "My mind is steadfastly fixed, and it is grounded in Christ."(2)  If thus it were with me, the fear of man should not so easily tempt me, nor the arrows of words move me.  Who is sufficient to foresee all things, who to guard beforehand against future ills?  If even things which are foreseen sometimes hurt us, what can things which are not foreseen do, but grievously injure?  But wherefore have I not better provided for myself, miserable that I am?  Why, too, have I given such heed to others?  But we are men, nor are we other than frail men, even though by many we are reckoned and called angels.  Whom shall I trust, O Lord, whom shall I trust but Thee?  Thou art the Truth, and deceivest not, nor canst be deceived.  And on the other hand, Every man is a liar,(3) weak, unstable and frail, especially in his words, so that one ought scarcely ever to believe what seemeth to sound right on the face of it. 4. With what wisdom hast thou warned us beforehand to beware of men, and that a man's foes are they of his own household,(4) and that we must not believe if one say unto us Lo here, or Lo there.(5)  I have been taught by my loss, and O that I may prove more careful and not foolish hereby.  "Be cautious," saith some one: "be cautious, keep unto thyself what I tell thee."  And whilst I am silent and believe that it is hid with me, he himself cannot keep silence concerning it, but straightway betrayeth me and himself, and goeth his way.  Protect me, O Lord, from such mischief-making and reckless men; let me not fall into their hands, nor ever do such things myself.  Put a true and steadfast word into my mouth, and remove a deceitful tongue far from me. What I would not suffer, I ought by all means to beware of doing. 5. Oh, how good and peacemaking a thing it is to be silent concerning others, and not carelessly to believe all reports, nor to hand them on further; how good also to lay one's self open to few, to seek ever to have Thee as the beholder of the heart; not to be carried about with every wind of words, but to desire that all things inward and outward be done according to the good pleasure of Thy will!  How safe for the preserving of heavenly grace to fly from human approval, and not to long after the things which seem to win admiration abroad, but to follow with all earnestness those things which bring amendment of life and heavenly fervour!  How many have been injured by their virtue being made known and too hastily praised.  How truly profitable hath been grace preserved in silence in this frail life, which, as we are told, is all temptation and warfare. (1) Psalm lx. 11.   (2) St. Agatha. (3) Psalm cxvi. 11; Romans iii. 4.   (4) Matthew x. 17, 36. (5) Matthew xxiv. 23. CHAPTER XLVI Of having confidence in God when evil words are cast at us "My Son, stand fast and believe in Me.  For what are words but words?  They fly through the air, but they bruise no stone.  If thou are guilty, think how thou wouldst gladly amend thyself; if thou knowest nothing against thyself, consider that thou wilt gladly bear this for God's sake.  It is little enough that thou sometimes hast to bear hard words, for thou art not yet able to bear hard blows.  And wherefore do such trivial matters go to thine heart, except that thou art yet carnal, and regardest men more than thou oughtest?  For because thou fearest to be despised, thou art unwilling to be reproved for thy faults, and seekest paltry shelters of excuses. 2. "But look better into thyself, and thou shalt know that the world is still alive in thee, and the vain love of pleasing men. For when thou fleest away from being abased and confounded for thy faults, it is plain that thou art neither truly humble nor truly dead to the world, and that the world is not crucified to thee.  But hearken to My word, and thou shalt not care for ten thousand words of men.  Behold, if all things could be said against thee which the utmost malice could invent, what should it hurt thee if thou wert altogether to let it go, and make no more account of it than of a mote?  Could it pluck out a single hair of thy head? 3. "But he that hath no heart within him, and hath not God before his eyes, is easily moved by a word of reproach; but he who trusteth in Me, and seeketh not to abide by his own judgment, shall be free from the fear of men.  For I am the Judge and the Discerner of all secrets; I know how the thing hath been done; I know both the injurer and the bearer.  From Me went forth that word, by My permission this hath happened, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.(1)  I shall judge the guilty and the innocent; but beforehand I have willed to try them both by a secret judgment. 4. "The testimony of men often deceiveth.  My judgment is true; it will stand, and it shall not be overturned.  It commonly lieth hid, and only to few in certain cases is it made known; yet it never erreth, nor can err, although it seem not right to the eyes of foolish men.  To Me, therefore, must men have recourse in all judgment, and must not lean to their opinion.  For there shall no evil happen to the just,(2) whatsoever may be sent to him by God. Even though some unjust charge be brought against him, he will care little; nor, again, will he exult above measure, if through others he be clearly vindicated.  For he considereth that I am He who try the hearts and reins,(3) who judge not outwardly and according to human appearance; for often in Mine eyes that is found blameworthy which in the judgment of men is held worthy of praise." 5. O Lord God, O Judge, just, strong, and patient, who knowest the frailty and sinfulness of men, be Thou my strength and my whole confidence; for my own conscience sufficeth me not.  Thou knowest what I know not; and therefore ought I under all rebuke to humble myself, and to bear it meekly.  Therefore mercifully forgive me as often as I have not done this, and grant me the next time the grace of greater endurance.  For better unto me is Thine abundant pity for the attainment of Thy pardon, than the righteousness which I believe myself to have for defence against my conscience, which lieth wait against me.  Although I know nothing against myself, yet I am not hereby justified,(4) because if Thy mercy were removed away, in Thy sight should no man living be justified.(5) (1) Luke ii. 35.   (2) Proverbs xii. 21.   (3) Psalm vii. 9. (4) 1 Corinthians iv. 4.   (5) Psalm cxliii. 2. CHAPTER XLVII That all troubles are to be endured for the sake of eternal life "My Son, let not the labours which thou hast undertaken for Me break thee down, nor let tribulations cast thee down in any wise, but let my promise strengthen and comfort thee in every event.  I am sufficient to reward thee above all measure and extent.  Not long shalt thou labour here, nor always be weighed down with sorrows.  Wait yet a little while, and thou shalt see a speedy end of thine evils.  An hour shall come when all labour and confusion shall cease.  Little and short is all that passeth away with time. 2. "Do earnestly what thou dost; labour faithfully in My vineyard; I will be thy reward.  Write, read, sing, weep, be silent, pray, endure adversities manfully; eternal life is worthy of all these conflicts, yea, and of greater.  Peace shall come in one day which is known to the Lord; which shall be neither day nor night,(1) but light eternal, infinite clearness, steadfast peace, and undisturbed rest.  Thou shalt not say then, Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?(2) nor cry out, Woe is me, for my sojourning is prolonged,(3) because death will be utterly destroyed, and there shall be salvation which can never fail, no more anxiety, happy delight, sweet and noble society. 3. "Oh, if thou sawest the unfading crowns of the Saints in heaven, and with what great glory they now rejoice, who aforetime were reckoned by this world contemptibly and as it were unworthy of life, truly thou wouldst immediately humble thyself even to the earth, and wouldst desire rather to be in subjection to all, than to have authority over one; nor wouldst thou long for pleasant days of this life, but wouldst more rejoice to be afflicted for God's sake, and wouldst esteem it gain to be counted for nought amongst men. 4. "Oh, if these things were sweet to thy taste, and moved thee to the bottom of thine heart, how shouldst thou dare even once to complain?  Are not all laborious things to be endured for the sake of eternal life?  It is no small thing, the losing or gaining the Kingdom of God.  Lift up therefore thy face to heaven.  Behold, I and all My Saints with Me, who in this world had a hard conflict, now rejoice, are now comforted, are now secure, are now at peace, and shall remain with Me evermore in the Kingdom of My Father." (1) Zechariah xiv. 7.   (2) Romans vii. 24. (3) Psalm cxx. CHAPTER XLVIII Of the day of eternity and of the straitnesses of this life Oh most blessed mansion of the City which is above!  Oh most clear day of eternity which the night obscureth not, but the Supreme Truth ever enlighteneth!  Day always joyful, always secure and never changing its state into those which are contrary.  Oh would that this day might shine forth, and that all these temporal things would come to an end.  It shineth indeed upon the Saints, glowing with unending brightness, but only from afar and through a glass, upon those who are pilgrims on the earth. 2. The citizens of heaven know how glorious that day is; the exiled sons of Eve groan, because this is bitter and wearisome. The days of this life are few and evil, full of sorrows and straits, where man is defiled with many sins, ensnared with many passions, bound fast with many fears, wearied with many cares, distracted with many questionings, entangled with many vanities, compassed about with many errors, worn away with many labours, weighed down with temptations, enervated by pleasures, tormented by poverty. 3. Oh when shall there be an end of these evils?  When shall I be delivered from the wretched slavery of my sins?  When shall I be mindful, O Lord, of Thee alone?  When shall I rejoice in Thee to the full?  When shall I be in true liberty without any impediment, without any burden on mind or body?  When shall there be solid peace, peace immovable and secure, peace within and without, peace firm on every side?  Blessed Jesus, when shall I stand to behold Thee?  When shall I gaze upon the glory of Thy kingdom?  When shalt Thou be to me all in all?  Oh when shall I be with Thee in Thy Kingdom which Thou hast prepared from the foundation of the world for them that love Thee?  I am left destitute, an exile in a hostile land, where are daily wars and grievous misfortunes. 4. Console my exile, mitigate my sorrow, for towards Thee all my desire longeth.  For all is to me a burden, whatsoever this world offereth for consolation.  I yearn to enjoy Thee intimately, but I cannot attain unto it.  I long to cleave to heavenly things, but temporal things and unmortified passions press me down.  In my mind I would be above all things, but in my flesh I am unwillingly compelled to be beneath them.  So, wretched man that I am, I fight with myself, and am made grievous even unto myself, while the spirit seeketh to be above and the flesh to be beneath. 5. Oh how I suffer inwardly, while with the mind I discourse on heavenly things, and presently a crowd of carnal things rusheth upon me whilst I pray.  My God, be not Thou far from me, nor depart in wrath from Thy servant.  Cast forth Thy lightning and scatter them; send out Thine arrows,(1) and let all delusions of my enemy be confounded.  Recall my senses unto Thyself, cause me to forget all worldly things; grant me quickly to cast away and despise the imaginations of sin.  Succour me, O Eternal Truth, that no vanity may move me.  Come unto me, O Heavenly Sweetness, and let all impurity flee from before Thy face.  Pardon me also, and of Thy mercy deal gently with me, whensoever in prayer I think on anything besides Thee; for truly I confess that I am wont to be continually distracted.  For often and often, where in the body I stand or sit, there I myself am not; but rather am I there, whither I am borne by my thoughts.  Where my thought is, there am I; and there commonly is my thought where that which I love is.  That readily occurreth to me, which naturally delighteth, or pleaseth through custom. 6. Wherefore Thou, who art the Truth, hast plainly said, Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.(2)  If I love heaven, I gladly meditate on heavenly things.  If I love the world, I rejoice in the delights of the world, and am made sorry by its adversities.  If I love the flesh, I am continually imagining the things which belong to the flesh; if I love the spirit, I am delighted by meditating on spiritual things.  For whatsoever things I love, on these I readily converse and listen, and carry home with me the images of them.  But blessed is that man who for Thy sake, O Lord, is willing to part from all creatures; who doth violence to his fleshly nature and crucifieth the lusts of the flesh by the fervour of his spirit, so that with serene conscience he may offer unto Thee a pure prayer, and be made worthy to enter into the angelic choirs, having shut out from himself, both outwardly and inwardly, all worldly things. (1) Psalm lxxi. 12.   (2) Matthew vi. 21. CHAPTER XLIX Of the desire after eternal life, and how great blessings are promised to those who strive "My Son, when thou feelest the desire of eternal happiness to be poured into thee from above, and longest to depart from the tabernacle of this body, that thou mayest contemplate My glory without shadow of turning, enlarge thine heart, and take in this holy inspiration with all thy desire.  Give most hearty thanks to the Supreme Goodness, who dealeth with thee so graciously, visiteth thee so lovingly, stirreth thee up so fervently, raiseth thee so powerfully, lest thou sink down through thine own weight, to earthly things.  For not by thine own meditating or striving dost thou receive this gift, but by the sole gracious condescension of Supreme Grace and Divine regard; to the end that thou mayest make progress in virtue and in more humility, and prepare thyself for future conflicts, and cleave unto Me with all the affection of thy heart, and strive to serve Me with fervent will. 2. "My Son, often the fire burneth, but the flame ascendeth not without smoke.  So also the desires of some men burn towards heavenly things, and yet they are not free from the temptation of carnal affection.  Thus therefore they are not acting with an altogether simple desire for God's glory when they pray to Him so earnestly.  Such, too, is oftentimes thy desire, when thou hast imagined it to be so earnest.  For that is not pure and perfect which is tainted with thine own self-seeking. 3. "Seek thou not what is pleasant and advantageous to thyself, but what is acceptable and honourable unto Me; for if thou judgest rightly, thou must choose and follow after My appointment rather than thine own desire; yea, rather than anything that can be desired.  I know thy desire, and I have heard thy many groanings.  Already thou longest to be in the glorious liberty of the children of God; already the eternal home delighteth thee, and the heavenly country full of joy; but the hour is not yet come; there remaineth still another season, even a season of warfare, a season of labour and probation.  Thou desirest to be filled with the Chief Good, but thou canst not attain it immediately.  I AM that Good; wait for Me, until the Kingdom of God shall come. 4. "Thou must still be tried upon earth, and be exercised in many things.  Consolation shall from time to time be given thee, but abundant satisfying shall not be granted.  Be strong therefore, and be thou brave both in working and in suffering things which are against thy nature.  Thou must put on the new man, and be changed into another man.  Thou must often do what thou wouldst not; and thou must leave undone what thou wouldst do.  What pleaseth others shall have good success, what pleaseth thee shall have no prosperity.  What others say shall be listened to; what thou sayest shall receive no heed.  Others shall ask and receive; thou shalt ask and not obtain.  Others shall be great in the report of men, but about thee shall nothing be spoken.  To others this or that shall be entrusted; thou shalt be judged useful for nought. 5. "For this cause nature shall sometimes be filled with sadness; and it is a great thing if thou bear it silently.  In this and many like things the faithful servant of the Lord is wont to be tried, how far he is able to deny himself and bring himself into subjection in all things.  Scarcely is there anything in which thou hast need to mortify thyself so much as in seeing things which are adverse to thy will; especially when things are commanded thee to be done which seem to thee inexpedient or of little use to thee.  And because thou darest not resist a higher power, being under authority, therefore it seemeth hard for thee to shape thy course according to the nod of another, and to forego thine own opinion. 6. "But consider, My Son, the fruit of these labours, the swift end, and the reward exceeding great; and thou shalt find it no pain to bear them then, but rather the strongest solace of thy patience.  For even in exchange for this trifling desire which thou hast readily forsaken, thou shalt always have thy will in Heaven.  There verily thou shalt find all that thou wouldst, all that thou canst long for.  There thou shalt have all good within thy power without the fear of losing it.  There thy will, ever at one with Mine, shall desire nothing outward, nothing for itself. There no man shall withstand thee, none shall complain of thee, none shall hinder, nothing shall stand in thy path; but all things desired by thee shall be present together, and shall refresh thy whole affection, and fill it up even to the brim. There I will glory for the scorn suffered here, the garment of praise for sorrow, and for the lowest place a throne in the Kingdom, for ever.  There shall appear the fruit of obedience, the labour of repentance shall rejoice, and humble subjection shall be crowned gloriously. 7. "Now therefore bow thyself humbly under the hands of all men; nor let it trouble thee who said this or who ordered that; but take special heed that whether thy superior, thy inferior, or thy equal, require anything from thee, or even show a desire for it; take it all in good part, and study with a good will to fulfil the desire.  Let one seek this, another that; let this man glory in this, and that man in that, and be praised a thousand thousand times, but rejoice thou only in the contempt of thyself, and in Mine own good pleasure and glory.  This is what thou art to long for, even that whether by life or by death God may be ever magnified in thee."(1) (1) Philippians i. 20. CHAPTER L How a desolate man ought to commit himself into the hands of God O Lord, Holy Father, be Thou blessed now and evermore; because as Thou wilt so it is done, and what Thou doest is good.  Let Thy servant rejoice in Thee, not in himself, nor in any other; because Thou alone art the true joy, Thou art my hope and my crown, Thou art my joy and my honour, O Lord.  What hath Thy servant, which he received not from Thee, even without merit of his own?  Thine are all things which Thou hast given, and which Thou hast made.  I am poor and in misery even from my youth up,(1) and my soul is sorrowful unto tears, sometimes also it is disquieted within itself, because of the sufferings which are coming upon it. 2. I long after the joy of peace; for the peace of Thy children do I beseech, for in the light of Thy comfort they are fed by Thee.  If Thou give peace, if Thou pour into me holy joy, the soul of Thy servant shall be full of melody, and devout in Thy praise.  But if Thou withdraw Thyself as too often Thou art wont, he will not be able to run in the way of Thy commandments, but rather he will smite his breast and will bow his knees; because it is not with him as yesterday and the day before, when Thy candle shined upon his head,(2) and he walked under the shadow of Thy wings,(3) from the temptations which beset him. 3. O Father, righteous and ever to be praised, the hour cometh when Thy servant is to be proved.  O beloved Father, it is well that in this hour Thy servant suffer somewhat for Thy sake.  O Father, evermore to be adored, as the hour cometh which Thou foreknewest from everlasting, when for a little while Thy servant should outwardly bow down, but always live inwardly with Thee; when for a little while he should be little regarded, humbled, and fail in the eyes of men; should be wasted with sufferings and weaknesses, to rise again with Thee in the dawn of the new light, and be glorified in the heavenly places.  O Holy Father, thou hast ordained it so, and so hast willed it; and that is done which Thou Thyself hast commanded. 4. For this is Thy favour to Thy friend, that he should suffer and be troubled in the world for Thy love's sake, how often soever, and by whomsoever and whosoever Thou hast suffered it to be done.  Without Thy counsel and providence, and without cause, nothing cometh to pass on the earth.  It is good for me, Lord, that I had been in trouble, that I may learn Thy statutes,(4) and may cast away all pride of heart and presumption.  It is profitable for me that confusion hath covered my face, that I may seek to Thee for consolation rather than unto men.  By this also I have learned to dread Thine unsearchable judgment, who afflictest the just with the wicked, but not without equity and justice. 5. Thanks be unto Thee, because Thou hast not spared my sins, but hast beaten me with stripes of love, inflicting pains, and sending troubles upon me without and within.  There is none who can console me, of all things which are under heaven, but Thou only, O Lord my God, Thou heavenly Physician of souls, who dost scourge and hast mercy, who leadest down to hell and bringest up again.(5)  Thy discipline over me, and Thy rod itself shall teach me. 6. Behold, O beloved Father, I am in Thy hands, I bow myself under the rod of Thy correction.  Smite my back and my neck that I may bend my crookedness to Thy will.  Make me a pious and lowly disciple, as Thou wert wont to be kind, that I may walk according to every nod of Thine.  To Thee I commend myself and all that I have for correction; better is it to be punished here than hereafter.  Thou knowest all things and each of them; and nothing remaineth hid from Thee in man's conscience.  Before they are, thou knowest that they will be, and Thou needest not that any man teach Thee or admonish Thee concerning the things which are done upon the earth.  Thou knowest what is expedient for my profit, and how greatly trouble serveth unto the scrubbing off the rust of sin.  Do with me according to Thy desired good pleasure, and despise not my life which is full of sin, known to none so entirely and fully as to Thee alone. 7. Grant me, O Lord, to know that which ought to be known; to love that which ought to be loved; to praise that which pleaseth Thee most, to esteem that which is precious in Thy sight, to blame that which is vile in Thine eyes.  Suffer me not to judge according to the sight of bodily eyes, nor to give sentence according to the hearing of the ears of ignorant men; but to discern in true judgment between visible and spiritual things, and above all things to be ever seeking after the will of Thy good pleasure. 8. Oftentimes the senses of men are deceived in judging; the lovers of the world also are deceived in that they love only visible things.  What is a man better because by man he is reckoned very great?  The deceiver deceiveth the deceiver, the vain man the vain, the blind man the blind, the weak man the weak, when they exalt one another; and in truth they rather put to shame, while they foolishly praise.  For as humble St. Francis saith, "What each one is in Thine eyes, so much he is, and no more." (1) Psalm lxxxviii. 15.   (2) Job xxix. 3.   (3) Psalm xvii. 8. (4) Psalm cxix. 71.   (5) Job xiii. 2. CHAPTER LI That we must give ourselves to humble works when we are unequal to those that are lofty "My Son, thou art not always able to continue in very fervent desire after virtues, nor to stand fast in the loftier region of contemplation; but thou must of necessity sometimes descend to lower things because of thine original corruption, and bear about the burden of corruptible life, though unwillingly and with weariness.  So long as thou wearest a mortal body, thou shalt feel weariness and heaviness of heart.  Therefore thou oughtest to groan often in the flesh because of the burden of the flesh, inasmuch as thou canst not give thyself to spiritual studies and divine contemplation unceasingly. 2. "At such a time it is expedient for thee to flee to humble and external works, and to renew thyself with good actions; to wait for My coming and heavenly visitation with sure confidence; to bear thy exile and drought of mind with patience, until thou be visited by Me again, and be freed from all anxieties.  For I will cause thee to forget thy labours, and altogether to enjoy eternal peace. I will spread open before thee the pleasant pastures of the Scriptures, that with enlarged heart thou mayest begin to run in the way of My commandments.  And thou shalt say, 'The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.'"(1) (1) Romans viii. 18. CHAPTER LII That a man ought not to reckon himself worthy of consolation, but more worthy of chastisement O Lord, I am not worthy of Thy consolation, nor of any spiritual visitation; and therefore Thou dealest justly with me, when Thou leavest me poor and desolate.  For if I were able to pour forth tears like the sea, still should I not be worthy of Thy consolation.  Therefore am I nothing worthy save to be scourged and punished, because I have grievously and many a time offended Thee, and in many things have greatly sinned.  Therefore, true account being taken, I am not worthy even of the least of Thy consolations.  But Thou, gracious and merciful God, who willest not that Thy works should perish, to show forth the riches of Thy mercy upon the vessels of mercy,(1) vouchsafest even beyond all his own deserving, to comfort Thy servant above the measure of mankind.  For Thy consolations are not like unto the discoursings of men. 2. What have I done, O Lord, that Thou shouldst bestow any heavenly comfort upon me?  I remember not that I have done any good, but have been ever prone to sin and slow to amendment.  It is true and I cannot deny it.  If I should say otherwise, Thou wouldst rise up against me, and there would be none to defend me.  What have I deserved for my sins but hell and everlasting fire?  In very truth I confess that I am worthy of all scorn and contempt, nor is it fit that I should be remembered among Thy faithful servants.  And although I be unwilling to hear this, nevertheless I will for the Truth's sake, accuse myself of my sins, that the more readily I may prevail to be accounted worthy of Thy mercy. 3. What shall I say, guilty that I am and filled with confusion? I have no mouth to utter, unless it be this word alone, "I have sinned, Lord, I have sinned; have mercy upon me, forgive me." Let me alone, that I may take comfort a little before I go whence I shall not return even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death.(2)  What dost Thou so much require of a guilty and miserable sinner, as that he be contrite, and humble himself for his sins?  In true contrition and humiliation of heart is begotten the hope of pardon, the troubled conscience is reconciled, lost grace is recovered, a man is preserved from the wrath to come, and God and the penitent soul hasten to meet each other with a holy kiss.(3) 4. The humble contrition of sinners is an acceptable sacrifice unto Thee, O Lord, sending forth a smell sweeter far in Thy sight than the incense.  This also is that pleasant ointment which Thou wouldst have poured upon Thy sacred feet, for a broken and contrite heart Thou hast never despised.(4)  There is the place of refuge from the wrathful countenance of the enemy.  There is amended and washed away whatsoever evil hath elsewhere been contracted. (1) Romans ix. 23.   (2) Job x. 20, 21.   (3) Luke xv. 20. (4) Psalm li. 17. CHAPTER LIII That the Grace of God doth not join itself to those who mind earthly things "My Son, precious is My grace, it suffereth not itself to be joined with outward things, nor with earthly consolations. Therefore thou oughtest to cast away all things which hinder grace, if thou longest to receive the inpouring thereof.  Seek a secret place for thyself, love to dwell alone with thyself, desire the conversation of no one; but rather pour out thy devout prayer to God, that thou mayest possess a contrite mind and a pure conscience.  Count the whole world as nought; seek to be alone with God before all outward things.  For thou canst not be alone with Me, and at the same time be delighted with transitory things.  Thou oughtest to be separated from thy acquaintances and dear friends, and keep thy mind free from all worldly comfort. So the blessed Apostle Peter beseecheth, that Christ's faithful ones bear themselves in this world as strangers and pilgrims.(1) 2. "Oh how great a confidence shall there be to the dying man whom no affection to anything detaineth in the world?  But to have a heart so separated from all things, a sickly soul doth not yet comprehend, nor doth the carnal man know the liberty of the spiritual man.  But if indeed he desire to be spiritually minded, he must renounce both those who are far off, and those who are near, and to beware of no man more than himself.  If thou perfectly conquer thyself, very easily shalt thou subdue all things besides.  Perfect victory is the triumph over oneself. For whoso keepeth himself in subjection, in such manner that the sensual affections obey the reason, and the reason in all things obeyeth Me, he truly is conqueror of himself, and lord of the world. 3. "If thou desire to climb to this height, thou oughtest to start bravely, and to lay the axe to the root, to the end that thou mayest pull up and destroy the hidden inordinate inclination towards thyself, and towards all selfish and earthly good.  From this sin, that a man loveth himself too inordinately, almost everything hangeth which needeth to be utterly overcome: when that evil is conquered and put under foot, there shall be great peace and tranquillity continually.  But because few strive earnestly to die perfectly to themselves, and do not heartily go forth from themselves, therefore do they remain entangled in themselves, and cannot be raised in spirit above themselves.  But he who desireth to walk at liberty with Me, must of necessity mortify all his evil and inordinate affections, and must cling to no creature with selfish love." (1) 1 Peter ii. 11. CHAPTER LIV Of the diverse motions of Nature and of Grace "My Son, pay diligent heed to the motions of Nature and of Grace, because they move in a very contrary and subtle manner, and are hardly distinguished save by a spiritual and inwardly enlightened man.  All men indeed seek good, and make pretence of something good in all that they say or do; and thus under the appearance of good many are deceived. 2. "Nature is deceitful and draweth away, ensnareth, and deceiveth many, and always hath self for her end; but Grace walketh in simplicity and turneth away from every appearance of evil, maketh no false pretences, and doeth all entirely for the sake of God, in whom also she finally resteth. 3. "Nature is very unwilling to die, and to be pressed down, and to be overcome, and to be in subjection, and to bear the yoke readily; but Grace studieth self-mortification, resisteth sensuality, seeketh to be subdued, longeth to be conquered, and willeth not to use her own liberty.  She loveth to be held by discipline, and not to have authority over any, but always to live, to remain, to have her being under God, and for God's sake is ready to be humbly subject to every ordinance of man. 4. "Nature laboureth for her own advantage, and considereth what profit she may gain from another; but Grace considereth more, not what may be useful and convenient to self, but what may be profitable to the many. 5. "Nature willingly receiveth honour and reverence; but Grace faithfully ascribeth all honour and glory to God. 6. "Nature feareth confusion and contempt, but Grace rejoiceth to suffer shame for the name of Jesus. 7. "Nature loveth ease and bodily quiet; Grace cannot be unemployed, but gladly embraceth labour. 8. "Nature seeketh to possess things curious and attractive, and abhorreth those which are rough and cheap; Grace is delighted with things simple and humble, despiseth not those which are rough, nor refuseth to be clothed with old garments. 9. "Nature hath regard to things temporal, rejoiceth in earthly lucre, is made sad by loss, vexed by any little injurious word; but Grace reacheth after things eternal, cleaveth not to those which are temporal, is not perturbed by losses, nor embittered by any hard words, because she hath placed her treasure and joy in heaven where nought perisheth. 10. "Nature is covetous, and receiveth more willingly than she giveth, loveth things that are personal and private to herself; while Grace is kind and generous, avoideth selfishness, is contented with a little, believeth that it is more blessed to give than to receive. 11. "Nature inclineth thee to created things, to thine own flesh, to vanities and dissipation; but Grace draweth to God and to virtues, renounceth creatures, fleeth from the world, hateth the desires of the flesh, restraineth vagaries, blusheth to be seen in public. 12. "Nature is glad to receive some outward solace in which the senses may have delight; but Grace seeketh to be comforted in God alone, and to have delight in the chief good above all visible things. 13. "Nature doeth everything for her own gain and profit, can do nothing as a free favour, but hopeth to attain something as good or better, or some praise or favour for her benefits; and she loveth that her own deeds and gifts should be highly valued; but Grace seeketh nothing temporal, nor requireth any other gift of reward than God alone; neither longeth she for more of temporal necessities than such as may suffice for the attaining of eternal life. 14. "Nature rejoiceth in many friends and kinsfolk, she boasteth of noble place and noble birth, she smileth on the powerful, flattereth the rich, applaudeth those who are like herself; but Grace loveth even her enemies, and is not lifted up by the multitude of friends, setteth no store upon high place or high birth, unless there be greater virtue therewith; favoureth the poor man more than the rich, hath more sympathy with the innocent than with the powerful; rejoiceth with the truthful, not with the liar; always exhorteth the good to strive after better gifts of grace, and to become by holiness like unto the Son of God. 15. "Nature quickly complaineth of poverty and of trouble; Grace beareth want with constancy. 16. "Nature looketh upon all things in reference to herself; striveth and argueth for self; but Grace bringeth back all things to God from whom they came at the beginning; ascribeth no good to herself nor arrogantly presumeth; is not contentious, nor preferreth her own opinion to others, but in every sense and understanding submitteth herself to the Eternal wisdom and the Divine judgment. 17. "Nature is eager to know secrets and to hear new things; she loveth to appear abroad, and to make experience of many things through the senses; she desireth to be acknowledged and to do those things which win praise and admiration; but Grace careth not to gather up new or curious things, because all this springeth from the old corruption, whereas there is nothing new or lasting upon earth.  So she teacheth to restrain the senses, to shun vain complacency and ostentation, to hide humbly those things which merit praise and real admiration, and from everything and in all knowledge to seek after useful fruit, and the praise and honour of God.  She desireth not to receive praise for herself or her own, but longeth that God be blessed in all His gifts, who out of unmingled love bestoweth all things." 18. This Grace is a supernatural light, and a certain special gift of God, and the proper mark of the elect, and the pledge of eternal salvation; it exalteth a man from earthly things to love those that are heavenly; and it maketh the carnal man spiritual. So far therefore as Nature is utterly pressed down and overcome, so far is greater Grace bestowed and the inner man is daily created anew by fresh visitations, after the image of God. CHAPTER LV Of the corruption of Nature and the efficacy of Divine Grace O Lord my God, who hast created me after thine own image and similitude, grant me this grace, which Thou hast shown to be so great and so necessary for salvation, that I may conquer my wicked nature, which draweth me to sin and to perdition.  For I feel in my flesh the law of sin, contradicting the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the obedience of sensuality in many things; nor can I resist its passions, unless Thy most holy grace assist me, fervently poured into my heart. 2. There is need of Thy grace, yea, and of a great measure thereof, that my nature may be conquered, which hath alway been prone to evil from my youth.  For being fallen through the first man Adam, and corrupted through sin, the punishment of this stain descended upon all men; so that Nature itself, which was framed good and right by Thee, is now used to express the vice and infirmity of corrupted Nature; because its motion left unto itself draweth men away to evil and to lower things.  For the little power which remaineth is as it were one spark lying hid in the ashes.  This is Natural reason itself, encompassed with thick clouds, having yet a discernment of good and evil, a distinction of the true and the false, though it be powerless to fulfil all that it approveth, and possess not yet the full light of truth, nor healthfulness of its affections. 3. Hence it is, O my God, that I delight in Thy law after the inward man,(1) knowing that Thy commandment is holy and just and good; reproving also all evil, and the sin that is to be avoided: yet with the flesh I serve the law of sin, whilst I obey sensuality rather than reason.  Hence it is that to will to do good is present with me, but how to perform it I find not.(2) Hence I ofttimes purpose many good things; but because grace is lacking to help mine infirmities, I fall back before a little resistance and fail.  Hence it cometh to pass that I recognize the way of perfectness, and see very clearly what things I ought to do; but pressed down by the weight of my own corruption, I rise not to the things which are more perfect. 4. Oh how entirely necessary is Thy grace to me, O Lord, for a good beginning, for progress, and for bringing to perfection. For without it I can do nothing, but I can do all things through Thy grace which strengtheneth me.(3)  O truly heavenly grace, without which our own merits are nought, and no gifts of Nature at all are to be esteemed.  Arts, riches, beauty, strength, wit, eloquence, they all avail nothing before Thee, O Lord, without Thy grace.  For the gifts of Nature belong to good and evil alike; but the proper gift of the elect is grace--that is, love-- and they who bear the mark thereof are held worthy of everlasting life.  So mighty is this grace, that without it neither the gift of prophecy nor the working of miracles, nor any speculation, howsoever lofty, is of any value at all.  But neither faith, nor hope, nor any other virtue is accepted with Thee without love and grace. 5. O most blessed grace that makest the poor in spirit rich in virtues, and renderest him who is rich in many things humble in spirit, come Thou, descend upon me, fill me early with Thy consolation, lest my soul fail through weariness and drought of mind.  I beseech thee, O Lord, that I may find grace in Thy sight, for Thy grace is sufficient for me,(4) when I obtain not those things which Nature longeth for.  If I be tempted and vexed with many tribulations, I will fear no evil, while Thy grace remaineth with me.  This alone is my strength, this bringeth me counsel and help.  It is more powerful than all enemies, and wiser than all the wise men in the world. 6. It is the mistress of truth, the teacher of discipline, the light of the heart, the solace of anxiety, the banisher of sorrow, the deliverer from fear, the nurse of devotion, the drawer forth of tears.  What am I without it, save a dry tree, a useless branch, worthy to be cast away!  "Let Thy grace, therefore, O Lord, always prevent and follow me, and make me continually given to all good works, through Jesus Christ, Thy Son.  Amen." (1) Romans vii. 12, 22. 25.   (2) Romans vii. 18.   (3) Philippians iv. 13. (4) 2 Corinthians xii. 9. CHAPTER LVI That we ought to deny ourselves, and to imitate Christ by means of the Cross My Son, so far as thou art able to go out of thyself so far shalt thou be able to enter into Me.  As to desire no outward thing worketh internal peace, so the forsaking of self inwardly joineth unto God.  I will that thou learn perfect self-denial, living in My will without contradiction or complaint.  Follow Me: I am the way, the truth, and the life.(1)  Without the way thou canst not go, without the truth thou canst not know, without the life thou canst not live.  I am the Way which thou oughtest to follow; the Truth which thou oughtest to believe; the Life which thou oughtest to hope for.  I am the Way unchangeable; the Truth infallible; the Life everlasting.  I am the Way altogether straight, the Truth supreme, the true Life, the blessed Life, the uncreated Life.  If thou remain in My way thou shalt know the Truth, and the truth shall make thee free,(2) and thou shalt lay hold on eternal life. 2. "If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.(3)  If thou wilt know the truth, believe in Me.  If thou wilt be perfect, sell all that thou hast.  If thou wilt be My disciple, deny thyself.  If thou wouldst possess the blessed life, despise the life which now is.  If thou wilt be exalted in heaven, humble thyself in the world.  If thou wilt reign with Me, bear the cross with Me; for only the servants of the cross find the way of blessedness and of true light." 3. O Lord Jesu, forasmuch as Thy life was straitened and despised by the world, grant unto me to imitate Thee in despising the world, for the servant is not greater than his lord, nor the disciple above his master.(4)  Let Thy servant be exercised in Thy life, because there is my salvation and true holiness. Whatsoever I read or hear besides it, it refresheth me not, nor giveth me delight. 4. "My son, because thou knowest these things and hast read them all, blessed shalt thou be if thou doest them.  He who hath My commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me, and I will love him, and will manifest Myself to him,(5) and I will make him to sit down with Me in My Father's Kingdom." 5. O Lord Jesu, as Thou hast said and promised, even so let it be unto me, and grant me to prove worthy.  I have received the cross at Thy hand; I have carried it, and will carry it even unto death, as Thou hast laid it upon me.  Truly the life of a truly devoted servant is a cross, but it leadeth to paradise.  I have begun; I may not return back nor leave it. 6. Come, my brothers, let us together go forward.  Jesus shall be with us.  For Jesus' sake have we taken up this cross, for Jesus' sake let us persevere in the cross.  He will be our helper, who was our Captain and Forerunner.  Behold our King entereth in before us, and He will fight for us.  Let us follow bravely, let no man fear terrors; let us be prepared to die bravely in battle, and let us not so stain our honour,(6) as to fly from the cross. (1) John xiv. 6.   (2) John viii. 32.   (3) Matthew xix. 17, 21. (4) Matthew x. 24.   (5) John xiv. 21.   (6) 1 Mac. ix. 10. CHAPTER LVII That a man must not be too much cast down when he falleth into some faults "My Son, patience and humility in adversities are more pleasing to Me than much comfort and devotion in prosperity.  Why doth a little thing spoken against thee make thee sad?  If it had been more, thou still oughtest not to be moved.  But now suffer it to go by; it is not the first, it is not new, and it will not be the last, if thou live long.  Thou art brave enough, so long as no adversity meeteth thee.  Thou givest good counsel also, and knowest how to strengthen others with thy words; but when tribulation suddenly knocketh at thine own door, thy counsel and strength fail.  Consider thy great frailty, which thou dost so often experience in trifling matters nevertheless, for thy soul's health these things are done when they and such like happen unto thee. 2. "Put them away from thy heart as well as thou canst, and if tribulation hath touched thee, yet let it not cast thee down nor entangle thee long.  At the least, bear patiently, if thou canst not joyfully.  And although thou be very unwilling to hear it, and feel indignation, yet check thyself, and suffer no unadvised word to come forth from thy lips, whereby the little ones may be offended.  Soon the storm which hath been raised shall be stilled, and inward grief shall be sweetened by returning grace. I yet live, saith the Lord, ready to help thee, and to give thee more than wonted consolation if thou put thy trust in Me, and call devoutly upon Me. 3. "Be thou more calm of spirit, and gird thyself for greater endurance.  All is not frustrated, though thou find thyself very often afflicted or grievously tempted.  Thou art man, not God; thou art flesh, not an angel.  How shouldst thou be able to remain alway in the same state of virtue, when an angel in heaven fell, and the first man in paradise?  I am He who lifteth up the mourners to deliverance, and those who know their own infirmity I raise up to my own nature." 4. O Lord, blessed be Thy word, sweeter to my mouth than honey and the honeycomb.  What should I do in my so great tribulations and anxieties, unless Thou didst comfort me with Thy holy words? If only I may attain unto the haven of salvation, what matter is it what things or how many I suffer?  Give me a good end, give me a happy passage out of this world.  Remember me, O my God, and lead me by the right way unto Thy Kingdom.  Amen. CHAPTER LVIII Of deeper matters, and God's hidden judgments which are not to be inquired into "My Son, beware thou dispute not of high matters and of the hidden judgments of God; why this man is thus left, and that man is taken into so great favour; why also this man is so greatly afflicted, and that so highly exalted.  These things pass all man's power of judging, neither may any reasoning or disputation have power to search out the divine judgments.  When therefore the enemy suggesteth these things to thee, or when any curious people ask such questions, answer with that word of the Prophet, Just art Thou, O Lord, and true is Thy judgment,(1) and with this, The judgments of the Lord are true, and righteous altogether.(2)  My judgments are to be feared, not to be disputed on, because they are incomprehensible to human understanding. 2. "And be not given to inquire or dispute about the merits of the Saints, which is holier than another, or which is the greater in the Kingdom of Heaven.  Such questions often beget useless strifes and contentions: they also nourish pride and vain glory, whence envyings and dissensions arise, while one man arrogantly endeavoureth to exalt one Saint and another another.  But to wish to know and search out such things bringeth no fruit, but it rather displeaseth the Saints; for I am not the God of confusion but of peace;(3) which peace consisteth more in true humility than in self-exaltation. 3. "Some are drawn by zeal of love to greater affection to these Saints or those; but this is human affection rather than divine. I am He Who made all the Saints: I gave them grace, I brought them glory; I know the merits of every one; I prevented them with the blessings of My goodness.(4)  I foreknew my beloved ones from everlasting, I chose them out of the world;(5) they did not choose Me.  I called them by My grace, drew them by My mercy, led them on through sundry temptations.  I poured mighty consolations upon them, I gave them perseverance, I crowned their patience. 4. "I acknowledge the first and the last; I embrace all with inestimable love.  I am to be praised in all My Saints; I am to be blessed above all things, and to be honoured in every one whom I have so gloriously exalted and predestined, without any preceding merits of their own.  He therefore that shall despise one of the least of these My people, honoureth not the great; because I made both small and great.(6)  And he who speaketh against any of My Saints speaketh against Me, and against all others in the Kingdom of Heaven."    They are all one through the bond of charity; they think the same thing, will the same thing, and all are united in love one to another. 5. "But yet (which is far better) they love Me above themselves and their own merits.  For being caught up above themselves, and drawn beyond self-love, they go all straightforward to the love of Me, and they rest in Me in perfect enjoyment.  There is nothing which can turn them away or press them down; for being full of Eternal Truth, they burn with the fire of inextinguishable charity.  Therefore let all carnal and natural men hold their peace concerning the state of the Saints, for they know nothing save to love their own personal enjoyment.  They take away and add according to their own inclination, not as it pleaseth the Eternal Truth. 6. "In many men this is ignorance, chiefly is it so in those who, being little enlightened, rarely learn to love any one with perfect spiritual love.  They are still much drawn by natural affection and human friendship to these or to those: and as they reckon of themselves in lower matters, so also do they frame imaginations of things heavenly.  But there is an immeasurable difference between those things which they imperfectly imagine, and these things which enlightened men behold through supernatural revelation. 7. "Take heed, therefore, My son, that thou treat not curiously those things which surpass thy knowledge, but rather make this thy business and give attention to it, namely, that thou seek to be found, even though it be the least, in the Kingdom of God. And even if any one should know who were holier than others, or who were held greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven; what should that knowledge profit him, unless through this knowledge he should humble himself before Me, and should rise up to give greater praise unto My name?  He who considereth how great are his own sins, how small his virtues, and how far he is removed from the perfection of the Saints, doeth far more acceptably in the sight of God, than he who disputeth about their greatness or littleness. 8. "They are altogether well content, if men would learn to be content, and to refrain from vain babbling.  They glory not of their own merits, seeing they ascribe no good unto themselves, but all unto Me, seeing that I of my infinite charity have given them all things.  They are filled with so great love of the Divinity, and with such overflowing joy, that no glory is lacking to them, neither can any felicity be lacking.  All the Saints, the higher they are exalted in glory, the humbler are they in themselves, and the nearer and dearer are they unto Me.  And so thou hast it written that they cast their crowns before God and fell on their faces before the Lamb, and worshipped Him that liveth for ever and ever.(7) 9. "Many ask who is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven, who know not whether they shall be worthy to be counted among the least. It is a great thing to be even the least in Heaven, where all are great, because all shall be called, and shall be, the sons of God.  A little one shall become a thousand, but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed.  For when the disciples asked who should be the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven, they received no other answer than this, Except ye be converted and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.  But whosoever shall humble himself as this little child, the same shall be greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven."(8) 10. Woe unto them who disdain to humble themselves willingly with the little children; for the low gate of the kingdom of Heaven will not suffer them to enter in.  Woe also to them who are rich, who have their consolation here;(9) because whilst the poor enter into the kingdom of God, they shall stand lamenting without.  Rejoice ye humble, and exult ye poor, for yours is the kingdom of God if only ye walk in the truth. (1) Psalm cxix. 137.  (2) Psalm xix. 9. (3) Corinthians xiv. 33.   (4) Psalm xxi. 3.   (5) John xv. 19. (6) Wisd. vi. 8.   (7) Revelation iv. 10; v. 14. (8) Matthew xviii. 3.   (9) Philippians ii. 21. CHAPTER LIX That all hope and trust is to be fixed in God alone O Lord, what is my trust which I have in this life, or what is my greatest comfort of all the things which are seen under Heaven? Is it not Thou, O Lord my God, whose mercies are without number? Where hath it been well with me without Thee?  Or when could it be evil whilst Thou wert near?  I had rather be poor for Thy sake, than rich without Thee.  I choose rather to be a pilgrim upon the earth with Thee than without Thee to possess heaven. Where Thou art, there is heaven; and where Thou are not, behold there death and hell.  Thou art all my desire, and therefore must I groan and cry and earnestly pray after Thee.  In short I can confide fully in none to give me ready help in necessities, save in Thee alone, O my God.  Thou art my hope, Thou art my trust, Thou art my Comforter, and most faithful in all things. 2. All men seek their own;(1) Thou settest forward only my salvation and my profit, and turnest all things unto my good. Even though Thou dost expose me to divers temptations and adversities, Thou ordainest all this unto my advantage, for Thou are wont to prove Thy beloved ones in a thousand ways.  In which proving Thou oughtest no less to be loved and praised, than if Thou wert filling me full of heavenly consolations. 3. In Thee, therefore, O Lord God, I put all my hope and my refuge, on Thee I lay all my tribulation and anguish; because I find all to be weak and unstable whatsoever I behold out of Thee. For many friends shall not profit, nor strong helpers be able to succour, nor prudent counsellors to give a useful answer, nor the books of the learned to console, nor any precious substance to deliver, nor any secret and beautiful place to give shelter, if Thou Thyself do not assist, help, strengthen, comfort, instruct, keep in safety. 4. For all things which seem to belong to the attainment of peace and felicity are nothing when Thou art absent, and bring no felicity at all in reality.  Therefore art Thou the end of all good, and the fulness of Life, and the soul of eloquence; and to hope in Thee above all things is the strongest solace of Thy servants.  Mine eyes look unto Thee,(2) in Thee is my trust, O my God, Father of mercies. 5. Bless and sanctify my soul with heavenly blessing that it may become Thy holy habitation, and the seat of Thy eternal glory; and let nothing be found in the Temple of Thy divinity which may offend the eyes of Thy majesty.  According to the greatness of Thy goodness and the multitude of Thy mercies look upon me, and hear the prayer of Thy poor servant, far exiled from Thee in the land of the shadow of death.  Protect and preserve the soul of Thy least servant amid so many dangers of corruptible life, and by Thy grace accompanying me, direct it by the way of peace unto its home of perpetual light.  Amen. (1) Luke vi.   (2) Psalm cxli. 8. THE FOURTH BOOK OF THE SACRAMENT OF THE ALTAR A devout exhortation to the Holy Communion The Voice of Christ Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you,(1) saith the Lord.  The bread that I will give is My flesh which I give for the life of the world.(2)  Take, eat: this is My Body, which is given for you; this do in remembrance of Me.(3)  He that eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood dwelleth in Me and I in him.  The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.(4) (1) Matthew xi. 28   (2) John vi. 51. (3) Matthew xxi. 26; Luke xxii. 19.   (4) John vi. 51, 63. CHAPTER I With how great reverence Christ must be received The Voice of the Disciple These are Thy words, O Christ, Eternal Truth; though not uttered at one time nor written together in one place of Scripture. Because therefore they are Thy words and true, I must gratefully and faithfully receive them all.  They are Thine, and Thou hast uttered them; and they are mine also, because Thou didst speak them for my salvation.  Gladly I receive them from Thy mouth, that they may be more deeply implanted in my heart.  Words of such great grace arouse me, for they are full of sweetness and love; but my own sins terrify me, and my impure conscience driveth me away from receiving so great mysteries.  The sweetness of Thy words encourageth me, but the multitude of my faults presseth me down. 2. Thou commandest that I draw near to Thee with firm confidence, if I would have part with Thee, and that I receive the food of immortality, if I desire to obtain eternal life and glory.  Come unto Me, sayest Thou, all that labour and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you.  Oh, sweet and lovely word in the ear of the sinner, that Thou, O Lord my God, dost invite the poor and needy to the Communion of Thy most holy body and blood.  But who am I, O Lord, that I should presume to approach unto Thee?  Behold the heaven of heavens cannot contain Thee, and yet Thou sayest, Come ye all unto Me. 3. What meaneth this most gracious condescension, this most lovely invitation?  How shall I dare to come, who know no good thing of myself, whence I might be able to presume?  How shall I bring Thee within my house, seeing that I so often have sinned in Thy most loving sight?  Angels and Archangels stand in awe of Thee, the Saints and just men fear Thee, and Thou sayest, Come unto Me!  Except Thou, Lord, hadst said it, who should believe it true?  And except Thou hadst commanded, who should attempt to draw near? 4. Behold, Noah, that just man, laboured for a hundred years in building the ark, that he might be saved with the few; and I, how shall I be able in one hour to prepare myself to receive the Builder of the world with reverence?  Moses, Thy servant, Thy great and especial friend, made an ark of incorruptible wood, which also he covered with purest gold, that he might lay up in it the tables of the law, and I, a corruptible creature, shall I dare thus easily to receive Thee, the Maker of the Law and the Giver of life?  Solomon, the wisest of the kings of Israel, was seven years building his magnificent temple to the praise of Thy Name, and for eight days celebrated the feast of its dedication, offered a thousand peace offerings, and solemnly brought up the Ark of the Covenant to the place prepared for it, with the sound of trumpets and great joy, and I, unhappy and poorest of mankind, how shall I bring Thee into my house, who scarce know how to spend half an hour in devotion?  And oh that it were even one half hour worthily spent! 5. O my God, how earnestly these holy men strove to please Thee! And alas! how little and trifling is that which I do! how short a time do I spend, when I am disposing myself to Communion. Rarely altogether collected, most rarely cleansed from all distraction.  And surely in the saving presence of Thy Godhead no unmeet thought ought to intrude, nor should any creature take possession of me, because it is not an Angel but the Lord of the Angels, that I am about to receive as my Guest. 6. Yet there is a vast difference between the Ark of the Covenant with its relics, and Thy most pure Body with its ineffable virtues, between those sacrifices of the law, which were figures of things to come, and the true sacrifice of Thy Body, the completion of all the ancient sacrifices. 7. Wherefore then do I not yearn more ardently after Thy adorable presence?  Why do I not prepare myself with greater solicitude to receive Thy holy things, when those holy Patriarchs and Prophets of old, kings also and princes, with the whole people, manifested so great affection of devotion towards Thy Divine Service? 8. The most devout king David danced with all his might before the Ark of God, calling to mind the benefits granted to his forefathers in days past; he fashioned musical instruments of various sorts, put forth Psalms, and appointed them to be sung with joy, played also himself ofttimes on the harp, being inspired with the grace of the Holy Ghost; he taught the people of Israel to praise God with the whole heart, and with unity of voice to bless and praise Him every day.  If so great devotion was then exercised, and celebration of divine praise was carried on before the Ark of the Testimony, how great reverence and devotion ought now to be shown by me and all Christian people at the ministering of the Sacrament, at receiving the most precious Body and Blood of Christ. 9. Many run to diverse places to visit the memorials of departed Saints, and rejoice to hear of their deeds and to look upon the beautiful buildings of their shrines.  And behold, Thou art present here with me, O my God, Saint of Saints, Creator of men and Lord of the Angels.  Often in looking at those memorials men are moved by curiosity and novelty, and very little fruit of amendment is borne away, especially when there is so much careless trifling and so little true contrition.  But here in the Sacrament of the Altar, Thou art present altogether, My God, the Man Christ Jesus; where also abundant fruit of eternal life is given to every one soever that receiveth Thee worthily and devoutly.  But to this no levity draweth, no curiosity, nor sensuality, only steadfast faith, devout hope, and sincere charity. 10. O God, invisible Creator of the world, how wondrously dost Thou work with us, how sweetly and graciously Thou dealest with Thine elect, to whom Thou offerest Thyself to be received in this Sacrament!  For this surpasseth all understanding, this specially draweth the hearts of the devout and enkindleth their affections. For even thy true faithful ones themselves, who order their whole life to amendment, oftentimes gain from this most excellent Sacrament great grace of devotion and love of virtue. 11. Oh admirable and hidden grace of the Sacrament, which only Christ's faithful ones know, but the faithless and those who serve sin cannot experience!  In this Sacrament is conferred spiritual grace, and lost virtue is regained in the soul, and the beauty which was disfigured by sin returneth again.  So great sometimes is this grace that out of the fulness of devotion given, not only the mind but also the weak body feeleth that more strength is supplied unto it. 12. But greatly must we mourn and lament over our lukewarmness and negligence, that we are not drawn by greater affection to become partakers of Christ, in whom all the hope and the merit of those that are to be saved consist.  For He Himself is our sanctification and redemption.(1)  He is the consolation of pilgrims and the eternal fruition of the Saints.  Therefore it is grievously to be lamented that many so little consider this health-giving mystery, which maketh heaven glad and preserveth the whole world.  Alas for the blindness and hardness of man's heart, that he considereth not more this unspeakable gift, and even slippeth down through the daily use, into carelessness. 13. For if this most holy Sacrament were celebrated in one place only, and were consecrated only by one priest in the whole world, with what great desire thinkest thou, would men be affected towards that place and towards such a priest of God, that they might behold the divine mysteries celebrated?  But now are many men made priests and in many places the Sacrament is celebrated, that the grace and love of God towards men might the more appear, the more widely the Holy Communion is spread abroad over all the world.  Thanks be unto Thee, O good Jesus, Eternal Shepherd, who hast vouchsafed to refresh us, poor and exiled ones, with Thy precious Body and Blood, and to invite us to partake these holy mysteries by the invitation from Thine own mouth, saying, Come unto Me, ye who labour and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you. (1) 1 Corinthians i. 30. CHAPTER II That the greatness and charity of God is shown to men in the Sacrament The Voice of the Disciple Trusting in Thy goodness and great mercy, O Lord, I draw near, the sick to the Healer, the hungering and thirsting to the Fountain of life, the poverty-stricken to the King of heaven, the servant to the Lord, the creature to the Creator, the desolate to my own gentle Comforter.  But whence is this unto me, that Thou comest unto me?  Who am I that Thou shouldest offer me Thyself? How doth a sinner dare to appear before Thee?  And how dost thou vouchsafe to come to the sinner?  Thou knowest Thy servant, and Thou knowest that he hath in him no good thing for which Thou shouldest grant him this grace.  I confess therefore mine own vileness, I acknowledge Thy goodness, I praise Thy tenderness, and I give Thee thanks for Thine exceeding great love.  For Thou doest this for Thine own sake, not for my merits, that Thy goodness may be more manifest unto me, Thy charity more abundantly poured out upon me, and Thy humility more perfectly commended unto me.  Therefore because this pleaseth Thee and Thou hast commanded that thus it shall be, Thy condescension pleaseth me also; and oh that mine iniquity hinder it not. 2. O most sweet and tender Jesus, what reverence, what giving of thanks is due to Thee with perpetual praise for the receiving of Thy sacred Body and Blood, the dignity whereof no man is found able to express.  But what shall I think upon in this Communion in approaching my Lord, whom I am not able worthily to honour, and nevertheless whom I long devoutly to receive?  What shall be better and more healthful meditation for me, than utter humiliation of myself before Thee, and exaltation of Thine infinite goodness towards me?  I praise Thee, O my God, and exalt Thee for evermore.  I despise myself, and cast myself down before Thee into the deep of my vileness. 3. Behold, Thou art the Saint of saints and I the refuse of sinners; behold, Thou stoopest unto me who am not worthy to look upon Thee; behold, Thou comest unto me, Thou willest to be with me, Thou invitest me to Thy feast.  Thou willest to give me the heavenly food and bread of angels to eat; none other, in truth, than Thyself, The living bread, which didst descend from heaven; and givest life to the world.(1) 4. Behold, whence this love proceedeth! what manner of condescension shineth forth herein.  What great giving of thanks and praise is due unto Thee for these benefits!  Oh how salutary and profitable Thy purpose when Thou didst ordain this!  How sweet and pleasant the feast when Thou didst give Thyself for food!  Oh how admirable is thy working, O Lord, how mighty Thy power, how unspeakable Thy truth!  For Thou didst speak the word, and all things were made; and this is done which Thou hast commanded. 5. A thing wonderful, and worthy of faith, and surpassing all the understanding of man, that Thou, O Lord my God, very God and very man, givest Thyself altogether to us in a little bread and wine, and art so our inexhaustible food.  Thou, O Lord of all, who hast need of nothing, hast willed to dwell in us through Thy Sacrament.  Preserve my heart and my body undefiled, that with a joyful and pure conscience I may be able very often to [celebrate, and](2) receive to my perpetual health.  Thy mysteries, which Thou hast consecrated and instituted both for Thine own honour, and for a perpetual memorial. 6. Rejoice, O my soul, and give thanks unto God for so great a gift and precious consolation, left unto thee in this vale of tears.  For so oft as thou callest this mystery to mind and receivest the body of Christ, so often dost thou celebrate the work of thy redemption, and art made partaker of all the merits of Christ.  For the charity of Christ never groweth less, and the greatness of His propitiation is never exhausted.  Therefore, by continual renewal of thy spirit, thou oughtest to dispose thyself hereunto and to weigh the great mystery of salvation with attentive consideration.  So great, new, and joyful ought it to appear to thee when thou comest to communion, as if on this self-same day Christ for the first time were descending into the Virgin's womb and becoming man, or hanging on the cross, suffering and dying for the salvation of mankind. (1) John vi. 51. (2) The words in brackets are only suitable for a priest. CHAPTER III That it is profitable to Communicate often The Voice of the Disciple Behold I come unto Thee, O Lord, that I may be blessed through Thy gift, and be made joyful in Thy holy feast which Thou, O God, of Thy goodness hast prepared for the poor.(1)  Behold in Thee is all that I can and ought to desire, Thou art my salvation and redemption, my hope and strength, my honour and glory.  Therefore rejoice the soul of Thy servant this day, for unto Thee, O Lord Jesus, do I lift up my soul.(2)  I long now to receive Thee devoutly and reverently, I desire to bring Thee into my house, so that with Zacchaeus I may be counted worthy to be blessed by Thee and numbered among the children of Abraham.  My soul hath an earnest desire for Thy Body, my heart longeth to be united with Thee. 2. Give me Thyself and it sufficeth, for besides Thee no consolation availeth.  Without Thee I cannot be, and without Thy visitation I have no power to live.  And therefore I must needs draw nigh unto Thee often, and receive Thee for the healing of my soul, lest haply I faint by the way if I be deprived of heavenly food.  For so Thou, most merciful Jesus, preaching to the people and healing many sick, didst once say, I will not send them away fasting to their own homes, lest they faint by the way.(3)  Deal therefore now to me in like manner, for Thou left Thyself for the consolation of the faithful in the Sacrament.  For Thou art the sweet refreshment of the soul, and he who shall eat Thee worthily shall be partaker and inheritor of the eternal glory.  Necessary indeed it is for me, who so often slide backwards and sin, so quickly wax cold and faint, to renew, cleanse, enkindle myself by frequent prayers and penitences and receiving of Thy sacred Body and Blood lest haply by too long abstinence, I fall short of my holy resolutions. 3. For the imaginations of man's heart are evil from his youth,(4) and except divine medicine succour him, man slideth away continually unto the worse.  The Holy Communion therefore draweth us back from evil, and strengtheneth us for good.  For if I now be so negligent and lukewarm when I communicate [or celebrate], how should it be with me, if I receive not this medicine, and sought not so great a help?  [And though I am not every day fit nor well prepared to celebrate, I will nevertheless give diligent heed at due season, to receive the divine mysteries, and to become partaker of so great grace].  For this is the one principal consolation of a faithful soul, so long as it is absent from Thee in mortal body, that being continually mindful of its God, it receiveth its Beloved with devout spirit. 4. Oh wonderful condescension of Thy pity surrounding us, that Thou, O Lord God, Creator and Quickener of all spirits, deignest to come unto a soul so poor and weak, and to appease its hunger with Thy whole Deity and Humanity.  Oh happy mind and blessed soul, to which is granted devoutly to receive Thee its Lord God, and in so receiving Thee to be filled with all spiritual joy!  Oh how great a Lord doth it entertain, how beloved a Guest doth it bring in, how delightful a Companion doth it receive, how faithful a Friend doth it welcome, how beautiful and exalted a Spouse, above every other Beloved, doth it embrace, One to be loved above all things that can be desired!  Oh my most sweet Beloved, let heaven and earth and all the glory of them, be silent in Thy presence; seeing whatsoever praise and beauty they have it is of Thy gracious bounty; and they shall never reach unto the loveliness of Thy Name, Whose Wisdom is infinite.(5) (1) Psalm lxviii. 10.

CHAPTER IV That many good gifts are bestowed upon those who Communicate devoutly The Voice of the Disciple O Lord my God, prevent Thou Thy servant with the blessings of Thy sweetness, that I may be enabled to draw near worthily and devoutly to Thy glorious Sacrament.  Awaken my heart towards Thee, and deliver me from heavy slumber.  Visit me with Thy salvation that I may in spirit taste Thy sweetness, which plentifully lieth hid in this Sacrament as in a fountain. Lighten also mine eyes to behold this so great mystery, and strengthen me that I may believe it with undoubting faith.  For it is Thy word, not human power; it is Thy holy institution, not the invention of man.  For no man is found fit in himself to receive and to understand these things, which transcend even the wisdom of the Angels.  What portion then shall I, unworthy sinner, who am but dust and ashes, be able to search into and comprehend of so deep a Sacrament? 2. O Lord, in the simplicity of my heart, in good and firm faith, and according to Thy will, I draw nigh unto Thee with hope and reverence, and truly believe that Thou art here present in the Sacrament, God and man.  Thou willest therefore that I receive Thee and unite myself to Thee in charity.  Wherefore I beseech Thy mercy, and implore Thee to give me Thy special grace, to this end, that I may be wholly dissolved and overflow with love towards Thee, and no more suffer any other consolation to enter into me.  For this most high and most glorious Sacrament is the health of the soul and the body, the medicine of all spiritual sickness, whereby I am healed of my sins, my passions are bridled, temptations are conquered or weakened, more grace is poured into me, virtue begun is increased, faith is made firm, hope is strengthened, and charity is enkindled and enlarged. 3. For in this Sacrament Thou hast bestowed many good things and still bestowest them continually on Thine elect who communicate devoutly, O my God, Lifter up of my soul, Repairer of human infirmity, and Giver of all inward consolation.  For Thou pourest into them much consolation against all sorts of tribulation, and out of the deep of their own misery Thou liftest them up to the hope of Thy protection, and with ever new grace, dost inwardly refresh and enlighten them; so that they who felt themselves to be anxious and without affection before Communion, afterwards being refreshed with heavenly food and drink, find themselves changed for the better.  And even in such wise Thou dealest severally with Thine elect, that they may truly acknowledge and clearly make proof that they have nothing whatsoever of their own, and what goodness and grace come to them from Thee; because being in themselves cold, hard of heart, indevout, through Thee they become fervent, zealous, and devout.  For who is there coming humbly to the fountain of sweetness, carrieth not away thence at the least some little of that sweetness?  Or who standing by a large fire, feeleth not from thence a little of its heat?  And Thou art ever a full and overflowing fountain, a fire continually burning, and never going out. 4. Wherefore if it is not suffered to me to draw from the fulness of the fountain, nor to drink unto satisfying, yet will I set my lips to the mouth of the heavenly conduit, that at least I may receive a small drop to quench my thirst, that I dry not up within my heart.  And if I am not yet able to be altogether heavenly and so enkindled as the Cherubim and Seraphim, yet will I endeavour to give myself unto devotion, and to prepare my heart, that I may gain if it be but a little flame of the divine fire, through the humble receiving of the life-giving Sacrament. But whatsoever is wanting unto me, O merciful Jesus, Most Holy Saviour, do Thou of Thy kindness and grace supply, who hast vouchsafed to call all unto Thee, saying, Come unto me, all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will refresh you. 5. I indeed labour in the sweat of my face, I am tormented with sorrow of heart, I am burdened with sins, I am disquieted with temptations, I am entangled and oppressed with many passions, and there is none to help me, there is none to deliver and ease me, but Thou, O Lord God, my Saviour, to whom I commit myself and all things that are mine, that Thou mayest preserve me and lead me unto life eternal.    Receive me unto the praise and glory of Thy name, who hast prepared Thy Body and Blood to be my meat and drink.  Grant, O Lord God my Saviour, that with coming often to Thy mysteries the zeal of my devotion may increase. CHAPTER V Of the dignity of this Sacrament, and of the office of the priest The Voice of the Beloved If thou hadst angelic purity and the holiness of holy John the Baptist, thou wouldest not be worthy to receive or to minister this Sacrament.  For this is not deserved by merit of man that a man should consecrate and minister the Sacrament of Christ, and take for food the bread of Angels.  Vast is the mystery, and great is the dignity of the priests, to whom is given what is not granted to Angels.  For priests only, rightly ordained in the church, have the power of consecrating and celebrating the Body of Christ.  The priest indeed is the minister of God, using the Word of God by God's command and institution; nevertheless God is there the principal Author and invisible Worker, that to whom all that He willeth is subject, and all He commandeth is obedient. 2. Therefore thou must believe God Almighty in this most excellent Sacrament, more than thine own sense or any visible sign at all.  And therefore with fear and reverence is this work to be approached.  Take heed therefore and see what it is of which the ministry is committed to thee by the laying on of the Bishop's hand.  Behold thou art made a priest and art consecrated to celebrate.  See now that thou do it before God faithfully and devoutly at due time, and shew thyself without blame.  Thou hast not lightened thy burden, but art now bound with a straiter bond of discipline, and art pledged to a higher degree of holiness.  A priest ought to be adorned with all virtues and to afford to others an example of good life.  His conversation must not be with the popular and common ways of men, but with Angels in Heaven or with perfect men on earth. 3. A priest clad in holy garments taketh Christ's place that he may pray unto God with all supplication and humility for himself and for the whole people.  He must always remember the Passion of Christ.  He must diligently look upon Christ's footsteps and fervently endeavour himself to follow them.  He must bear meekly for God whatsoever ills are brought upon him by others.  He must mourn for his own sins, and for the sins committed by others, and may not grow careless of prayer and holy oblation, until he prevail to obtain grace and mercy.  When the priest celebrateth, he honoureth God, giveth joy to the Angels, buildeth up the Church, helpeth the living, hath communion with the departed, and maketh himself a partaker of all good things. CHAPTER VI An inquiry concerning preparation for Communion The Voice of the Disciple When I consider Thy dignity, O Lord, and mine own vileness, I tremble very exceedingly, and am confounded within myself.  For if I approach not, I fly from life; and if I intrude myself unworthily, I run into Thy displeasure.  What then shall I do, O my God, Thou helper and Counsellor in necessities. 2. Teach Thou me the right way; propound unto me some short exercise befitting Holy Communion.  For it is profitable to know how I ought to prepare my heart devoutly and reverently for Thee, to the intent that I may receive Thy Sacrament to my soul's health [or it may be also for the celebrating this so great and divine mystery]. CHAPTER VII Of the examination of conscience, and purpose of amendment The Voice of the Beloved Above all things the priest of God must draw nigh, with all humility of heart and supplicating reverence, with full faith and pious desire for the honour of God, to celebrate, minister, and receive this Sacrament.  Diligently examine thy conscience and with all thy might with true contrition and humble confession cleanse and purify it, so that thou mayest feel no burden, nor know anything which bringeth thee remorse and impedeth thy free approach.  Have displeasure against all thy sins in general, and specially sorrow and mourn because of thy daily transgressions. And if thou have time, confess unto God in the secret of thine heart, all miseries of thine own passion. 2. Lament grievously and be sorry, because thou art still so carnal and worldly, so unmortified from thy passions, so full of the motion of concupiscence, so unguarded in thine outward senses, so often entangled in many vain fancies, so much inclined to outward things, so negligent of internal; so ready to laughter and dissoluteness, so unready to weeping and contrition; so prone to ease and indulgence of the flesh, so dull to zeal and fervour; so curious to hear novelties and behold beauties, so loth to embrace things humble and despised; so desirous to have many things, so grudging in giving, so close in keeping; so inconsiderate in speaking, so reluctant to keep silence; so disorderly in manners, so inconsiderate in actions; so eager after food, so deaf towards the Word of God; so eager after rest, so slow to labour; so watchful after tales, so sleepy towards holy watchings; so eager for the end of them, so wandering in attention to them; so negligent in observing the hours of prayer, so lukewarm in celebrating, so unfruitful in communicating; so quickly distracted, so seldom quite collected with thyself; so quickly moved to anger, so ready for displeasure at others; so prone to judging, so severe at reproving; so joyful in prosperity, so weak in adversity; so often making many good resolutions and bringing them to so little effect. 3. When thou hast confessed and bewailed these and thy other shortcomings, with sorrow and sore displeasure at thine own infirmity, make then a firm resolution of continual amendment of life and of progress in all that is good.  Then moreover with full resignation and entire will offer thyself to the honour of My name on the altar of thine heart as a perpetual whole burnt-offering, even by faithfully presenting thy body and soul unto Me, to the end that thou mayest so be accounted worthy to draw near to offer this sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to God, and to receive the Sacrament of My Body and Blood to thy soul's health.  For there is no oblation worthier, no satisfaction greater for the destroying of sin, than that a man offer himself to God purely and entirely with the oblation of the Body and Blood of Christ in the Holy Communion.  If a man shall have done what in him lieth, and shall repent him truly, then how often soever he shall draw nigh unto Me for pardon and grace, As I live, saith the Lord, I have no pleasure in the death of a sinner, but rather that he should be converted, and live. All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him.(1) (1) Ezekiel xviii. 22, 23. CHAPTER VIII Of the oblation of Christ upon the cross, and of resignation of self The Voice of the Beloved As I of my own will offered myself unto God the Father on the Cross for thy sins with outstretched hands and naked body, so that nothing remained in Me that did not become altogether a sacrifice for the Divine propitiation; so also oughtest thou every day to offer thyself willingly unto Me for a pure and holy oblation with all thy strength and affections, even to the utmost powers of thine heart.  What more do I require of thee than thou study to resign thyself altogether unto Me?  Whatsoever thou givest besides thyself, I nothing care for, for I ask not thy gift, but thee. 2. As it would not be sufficient for thee if thou hadst all things except Me, even so whatsoever thou shalt give Me, if thou give Me not thyself, it cannot please Me.  Offer thyself to Me, and give thyself altogether for God, so shall thy offering be accepted.  Behold I offered Myself altogether to the Father for thee, I give also My whole body and blood for food, that thou mightest remain altogether Mine and I thine.  But if thou stand in thyself, and offer not thyself freely to My will, thy offering is not perfect, neither shall the union betwixt us be complete. Therefore ought the freewill offering of thyself into the hands of God to go before all thy works, if thou wilt attain liberty and grace.  For this is the cause that so few are inwardly enlightened and made free, that they know not how to deny themselves entirely.  My word standeth sure, Except a man forsake all, he cannot be My disciple.(1)  Thou therefore, if thou wilt be My disciple, offer thyself to Me with all thy affections. (1) Luke xiv. 33. CHAPTER IX That we ought to offer ourselves and all that is ours to God, and to pray for all The Voice of the Disciple Lord, all that is in the heaven and in the earth is Thine.(1)  I desire to offer myself up unto thee as a freewill offering, and to continue Thine for ever.  Lord, in the uprightness of mine heart I willingly offer(2) myself to Thee to-day to be Thy servant for ever, in humble submission and for a sacrifice of perpetual praise.  Receive me with this holy Communion of Thy precious Body, which I celebrate before Thee this day in the presence of the Angels invisibly surrounding, that it may be for the salvation of me and of all Thy people. 2. Lord, I lay before Thee at this celebration all my sins and offences which I have committed before Thee and Thy holy Angels, from the day whereon I was first able to sin even unto this hour; that Thou mayest consume and burn them every one with the fire of Thy charity, and mayest do away all the stains of my sins, and cleanse my conscience from all offence, and restore me to Thy favour which by sinning I have lost, fully forgiving me all, and mercifully admitting me to the kiss of peace. 3. What can I do concerning my sins, save humbly to confess and lament them and unceasingly to beseech Thy propitiation?  I beseech Thee, be propitious unto me and hear me, when I stand before Thee, O my God.  All my sins displease me grievously: I will never more commit them; but I grieve for them and will grieve so long as I live, steadfastly purposing to repent me truly, and to make restitution as far as I can.  Forgive, O God, forgive me my sins for Thy holy Name's sake; save my soul, which Thou hast redeemed with Thy precious blood.  Behold I commit myself to Thy mercy, I resign myself to Thy hands.  Deal with me according to Thy loving-kindness, not according to my wickedness and iniquity. 4. I offer also unto Thee all my goodness, though it is exceedingly little and imperfect, that Thou mayest mend and sanctify it, that Thou mayest make it well pleasing and acceptable in Thy sight, and ever draw it on towards perfection; and furthermore bring me safely, slothful and useless poor creature that I am, to a happy and blessed end. 5. Moreover I offer unto Thee all pious desires of the devout, necessities of parents, friends, brothers, sisters, and all who are dear to me, and of those who have done good to me, or to others for Thy love; and those who have desired and besought my prayers for themselves and all belonging to them; that all may feel themselves assisted by Thy grace, enriched by consolation, protected from dangers, freed from pains; and that being delivered from all evils they may joyfully give Thee exceeding thanks. 6. I offer also to Thee prayers and Sacramental intercessions for those specially who have injured me in aught, made me sad, or spoken evil concerning me, or have caused me any loss or displeasure; for all those also whom I have at any time made sad, disturbed, burdened, and scandalized, by words or deeds, knowingly or ignorantly; that to all of us alike, Thou mayest equally pardon our sins and mutual offences.  Take away, O Lord, from our hearts all suspicion, indignation, anger, and contention, and whatsoever is able to injure charity and diminish brotherly love.  Have mercy, have mercy, Lord, on those who entreat Thy mercy; give grace to the needy; and make us such that we may be worthy to enjoy Thy grace, and go forward to the life eternal.  Amen. (1) 1 Chronicles xxix. 11.   (2) 1 Chronicles xxix. 17. CHAPTER X That Holy Communion is not lightly to be omitted The Voice of the Beloved Thou must frequently betake thee to the Fountain of grace and divine mercy, to the Fountain of goodness and all purity; to the end that thou mayest obtain the healing of thy passions and vices, and mayest be made stronger and more watchful against all temptations and wiles of the devil.  The enemy, knowing what profit and exceeding strong remedy lieth in the Holy Communion, striveth by all means and occasions to draw back and hinder the faithful and devout, so far as he can. 2. For when some set about to prepare themselves for Holy Communion, they suffer from the more evil suggestions of Satan. The very evil spirit himself (as is written in Job), cometh among the sons of God that he may trouble them by his accustomed evil dealing, or make them over timid and perplexed; to the intent that he may diminish their affections, or take away their faith by his attacks, if haply he may prevail upon them to give up Holy Communion altogether, or to come thereto with lukewarm hearts. But his wiles and delusions must not be heeded, howsoever wicked and terrible they be; but all his delusion must be cast back upon his own head.  The wretch must be despised and laughed to scorn: neither must Holy Communion be omitted because of his insults and the inward troubles which he stirreth up. 3. Often also too much carefulness or some anxiety or other touching confession hindereth from obtaining devotion.  Do thou according to the counsel of wise men, and lay aside anxiety and scruple, because it hindereth the grace of God and destroyeth devotion of mind.  Because of some little vexation or trouble do not thou neglect Holy Communion, but rather hasten to confess it, and forgive freely all offences committed against thee. And if thou hast offended any man, humbly beg for pardon, and God shall freely forgive thee. 4. What profiteth it to put off for long time the confession of thy sins, or to defer Holy Communion?  Cleanse thyself forthwith, spit out the poison with all speed, hasten to take the remedy, and thou shalt feel thyself better than if thou didst long defer it.  If to-day thou defer it on one account, to-morrow perchance some greater obstacle will come, and so thou mayest be long time hindered from Communion and become more unfit.  As soon as thou canst, shake thyself from thy present heaviness and sloth, for it profiteth nothing to be long anxious, to go long on thy way with heaviness of heart, and because of daily little obstacles to sever thyself from divine things: nay it is exceeding hurtful to defer thy Communion long, for this commonly bringeth on great torpor.  Alas! there are some, lukewarm and undisciplined, who willingly find excuses for delaying repentance, and desire to defer Holy Communion, lest they should be bound to keep stricter watch upon themselves. 5. Alas! how little charity, what flagging devotion, have they who so lightly put off Holy Communion.  How happy is he, how acceptable to God, who so liveth, and in such purity of conscience keepeth himself, that any day he could be ready and well inclined to communicate, if it were in his power, and might be done without the notice of others.  If a man sometimes abstaineth for the sake of humility or some sound cause, he is to be commended for his reverence.  But if drowsiness have taken hold of him, he ought to rouse himself and to do what in him lieth; and the Lord will help his desire for the good will which he hath, which God specially approveth. 6. But when he is hindered by sufficient cause, yet will he ever have a good will and pious intention to communicate; and so he shall not be lacking in the fruit of the Sacrament.  For any devout man is able every day and every hour to draw near to spiritual communion with Christ to his soul's health and without hindrance.  Nevertheless on certain days and at the appointed time he ought to receive the Body and Blood of his Redeemer with affectionate reverence, and rather to seek after the praise and honour of God, than his own comfort.  For so often doth he communicate mystically, and is invisibly refreshed, as he devoutly calleth to mind the mystery of Christ's incarnation and His Passion, and is inflamed with the love of Him. 7. He who only prepareth himself when a festival is at hand or custom compelleth, will too often be unprepared.  Blessed is he who offereth himself to God for a whole burnt-offering, so often as he celebrateth or communicateth!  Be not too slow nor too hurried in thy celebrating, but preserve the good received custom of those with whom thou livest.  Thou oughtest not to produce weariness and annoyance in others, but to observe the received custom, according to the institution of the elders; and to minister to the profit of others rather than to thine own devotion or feeling. CHAPTER XI That the Body and Blood of Christ and the Holy Scriptures are most necessary to a faithful soul The Voice of the Disciple O most sweet Lord Jesus, how great is the blessedness of the devout soul that feedeth with Thee in Thy banquet, where there is set before it no other food than Thyself its only Beloved, more to be desired than all the desires of the heart?  And to me it would verily be sweet to pour forth my tears in Thy presence from the very bottom of my heart, and with the pious Magdalene to water Thy feet with my tears.  But where is this devotion?  Where the abundant flowing of holy tears?  Surely in Thy presence and in the presence of the holy Angels my whole heart ought to burn and to weep for joy; for I have Thee in the Sacrament verily present, although hidden under other form. 2. For in Thine own Divine brightness, mine eyes could not endure to behold Thee, neither could the whole world stand before the splendour of the glory of Thy Majesty.  In this therefore Thou hast consideration unto my weakness, that Thou hidest Thyself under the Sacrament.  I verily possess and adore Him whom the Angels adore in heaven; I yet for a while by faith, but they by sight and without a veil.  It is good for me to be content with the light of true faith, and to walk therein until the day of eternal brightness dawn, and the shadows of figures flee away.(1) But when that which is perfect is come, the using of Sacraments shall cease, because the Blessed in heavenly glory have no need of Sacramental remedy.  For they rejoice unceasingly in the presence of God, beholding His glory face to face, and being changed from glory to glory(2) of the infinite God, they taste the Word of God made flesh, as He was in the beginning and remaineth for everlasting. 3. When I think on these wondrous things, even spiritual comfort whatsoever it be becometh sore weariness to me; for so long as I see not openly my Lord in His own Glory, I count for nothing all which I behold and hear in the world.  Thou, O God, art my witness that nothing is able to comfort me, no creature is able to give me rest, save Thou, O my God, whom I desire to contemplate everlastingly.  But this is not possible, so long as I remain in this mortal state.  Therefore ought I to set myself unto great patience, and submit myself unto Thee in every desire. For even Thy Saints, O Lord, who now rejoice with Thee in the kingdom of heaven, waited for the coming of Thy glory whilst they lived here, in faith and great glory.  What they believed, that believe I; what they hoped, I hope; whither they have attained to, thither through Thy grace hope I to come.  I will walk meanwhile in faith, strengthened by the examples of the Saints. I will have also holy books for comfort and for a mirror of life, and above them all Thy most holy Body and Blood shall be for me a special remedy and refuge. 4. For two things do I feel to be exceedingly necessary to me in this life, without which this miserable life would be intolerable to me; being detained in the prison of this body, I confess that I need two things, even food and light.  Thou hast therefore given to me who am so weak, Thy sacred Body and Blood, for the refreshing of my soul and body, and hast set Thy Word for a lantern to my feet.(3)  Without these two I could not properly live; for the Word of God is the light of my soul, and Thy Sacrament the bread of life.  These may also be called the two tables, placed on this side and on that, in the treasury of Thy holy Church.  One table is that of the Sacred Altar, bearing the holy bread, that is the precious Body and Blood of Christ; the other is the table of the Divine Law, containing holy doctrine, teaching the true faith, and leading steadfastly onwards even to that which is within the veil, where the Holy of Holies is. 5. Thanks be unto Thee, O Lord Jesus, Light of Light everlasting, for that table of holy doctrine which Thou has furnished unto us by Thy servants the Prophets and Apostles and other teachers. Thanks be to Thee, O Creator and Redeemer of men, who to make known Thy love to the whole world has prepared a great supper, in which Thou hast set forth for good not the typical lamb, but Thine own most Holy Body and Blood; making all Thy faithful ones joyful with this holy banquet and giving them to drink the cup of salvation, wherein are all the delights of Paradise, and the holy Angels do feed with us, and with yet happier sweetness. 6. Oh how great and honourable is the office of the priests, to whom it is given to consecrate the Sacrament of the Lord of majesty with holy words, to bless it with the lips, to hold it in their hands, to receive it with their own mouth, and to administer it to others!  Oh how clean ought those hands to be, how pure the mouth, how holy the body, how unspotted the heart of the priest, to whom so often the Author of purity entereth in! From the mouth of the priest ought naught to proceed but what is holy, what is honest and profitable, because he so often receiveth the Sacrament of Christ. 7. His eyes ought to be single and pure, seeing they are wont to look upon the Body of Christ; the hands should be pure and lifted towards heaven, which are wont to hold within them the Creator of heaven and earth.  To priests is it specially said in the Law, Be ye holy, for I the Lord your God am holy.(4) 8. Assist us with Thy grace, O Almighty God, that we who have taken upon us the priestly office, may be able to converse worthily and devoutly with Thee in all purity and good conscience.  And if we are not able to have our conversation in such innocency of life as we ought, yet grant unto us worthily to lament the sins which we have committed, and in the spirit of humility and full purpose of a good will, to serve Thee more earnestly for the future. (1) Cant. ii. 17.   (2) 2 Corinthians iii. 18. (3) Psalm cxix. 105.   (4) Leviticus xix. 2. CHAPTER XII That he who is about to Communicate with Christ ought to prepare himself with great diligence The Voice of the Beloved I am the Lover of purity, and Giver of sanctity. I seek a pure heart, and there is the place of My rest.  Prepare for Me the larger upper room furnished, and I will keep the Passover at thy house with my disciples.(1)  If thou wilt that I come unto thee and abide with thee, purge out the old leaven,(2) and cleanse the habitation of thy heart.  Shut out the whole world, and all the throng of sins; sit as a sparrow alone upon the house-top,(3) and think upon thy transgressions with bitterness of thy soul.  For everyone that loveth prepareth the best and fairest place for his beloved, because hereby the affection of him that entertaineth his beloved is known. 2. Yet know thou that thou canst not make sufficient preparation out of the merit of any action of thine, even though thou shouldest prepare thyself for a whole year, and hadst nothing else in thy mind.  But out of My tenderness and grace alone art thou permitted to draw nigh unto My table; as though a beggar were called to a rich man's dinner, and had no other recompense to offer him for the benefits done unto him, but to humble himself and to give him thanks.  Do therefore as much as lieth in thee, and do it diligently, not of custom, nor of necessity, but with fear, reverence, and affection, receive the Body of thy beloved Lord God, who vouchsafeth to come unto thee.  I am He who hath called thee; I commanded it to be done; I will supply what is lacking to thee; come and receive Me. 3. When I give the grace of devotion, give thanks unto thy God; it is not because thou art worthy, but because I had mercy on thee.  If thou hast not devotion, but rather feelest thyself dry, be instant in prayer, cease not to groan and knock; cease not until thou prevail to obtain some crumb or drop of saving grace. Thou hast need of Me, I have no need of thee.  Nor dost thou come to sanctify Me, but I come to sanctify thee and make thee better. Thou comest that thou mayest be sanctified by Me, and be united to Me; that thou mayest receive fresh grace, and be kindled anew to amendment of life.  See that thou neglect not this grace, but prepare thy heart with all diligence, and receive thy Beloved unto thee. 4. But thou oughtest not only to prepare thyself for devotion before Communion, thou must also keep thyself with all diligence therein after receiving the Sacrament; nor is less watchfulness needed afterwards, than devout preparation beforehand: for good watchfulness afterwards becometh in turn the best preparation for the gaining more grace.  For hereby is a man made entirely indisposed to good, if he immediately return from Communion to give himself up to outward consolations.  Beware of much speaking; remain in a secret place, and hold communion with thy God; for thou hast Him whom the whole world cannot take away from thee.  I am He to whom thou oughtest wholly to give thyself; so that now thou mayest live not wholly in thyself, but in Me, free from all anxiety. (1) Mark xiv. 14, 15.   (2) 1 Corinthians v. 7. (3) Psalm cii. 7. CHAPTER XIII That the devout soul ought with the whole heart to yearn after union with Christ in the Sacrament The Voice of the Disciple Who shall grant unto me, O Lord, that I may find Thee alone, and open all my heart unto Thee, and enjoy Thee as much as my soul desireth; and that no man may henceforth look upon me, nor any creature move me or have respect unto me, but Thou alone speak unto me and I unto Thee, even as beloved is wont to speak unto beloved, and friend to feast with friend?  For this do I pray, this do I long for, that I may be wholly united unto Thee, and may withdraw my heart from all created things, and by means of Holy Communion and frequent celebration may learn more and more to relish heavenly and eternal things.  Ah, Lord God, when shall I be entirely united and lost in Thee, and altogether forgetful of myself?  Thou in me, and I in Thee;(1) even so grant that we may in like manner continue together in one. 2. Verily Thou art my Beloved, the choicest among ten thousand,(2) in whom my soul delighteth to dwell all the days of her life.  Verily Thou art my Peacemaker, in Whom is perfect peace and true rest, apart from Whom is labour and sorrow and infinite misery.  Verily Thou art a God that hidest Thyself, and Thy counsel is not with the wicked, but Thy Word is with the humble and the simple.  O how sweet, O Lord, is Thy spirit, who that Thou mightest manifest Thy sweetness towards Thy children, dost vouchsafe to refresh them with the bread which is full of sweetness, which cometh down from heaven.  Verily there is no other nation so great, which hath its gods drawing nigh to them, as Thou, our God, art present unto all Thy faithful ones,(3) unto whom for their daily solace, and for lifting up their heart unto heaven, Thou givest Thyself for their food and delight. 3. For what other nation is there so renowned as the Christian people?  Or what creature is so beloved under heaven as the devout soul to which God entereth in, that he may feed it with His glorious flesh?  O unspeakable grace!  O wonderful condescension!  O immeasurable love specially bestowed upon men! But what reward shall I give unto the Lord for this grace, for charity so mighty?  There is nothing which I am able to present more acceptable than to give my heart altogether unto God, and to join it inwardly to Him.  Then all my inward parts shall rejoice, when my soul shall be perfectly united unto God.  Then shall He say unto me, "If thou wilt be with Me, I will be with thee."  And I will answer Him, "Vouchsafe, O Lord, to abide with me, I will gladly be with Thee; this is my whole desire, even that my heart be united unto Thee." (1) John xv. 4.   (2) Cant. v. 10.   (3) Deuteronomy iv. 7. CHAPTER XIV Of the fervent desire of certain devout persons to receive the Body and Blood of Christ The Voice of the Disciple O how great is the abundance of Thy sweetness, O Lord, which Thou hast laid up for them that fear Thee.  When I call to mind some devout persons who draw nigh to Thy Sacrament, O Lord, with the deepest devotion and affection, then very often I am confounded in myself and blush for shame, that I approach Thine altar and table of Holy Communion so carelessly and coldly, that I remain so dry and without affection, that I am not wholly kindled with love before Thee, my God, nor so vehemently drawn and affected as many devout persons have been, who out of the very earnest desire of the Communion, and tender affection of heart, could not refrain from weeping, but as it were with mouth of heart and body alike panted inwardly after Thee, O God, O Fountain of Life, having no power to appease or satiate their hunger, save by receiving Thy Body with all joyfulness and spiritual eagerness. 2. O truly ardent faith of those, becoming a very proof of Thy Sacred Presence!  For they verily know their Lord in the breaking of bread, whose heart so ardently burneth within them(1) when Jesus walketh with them by the way.  Ah me! far from me for the most part is such love and devotion as this, such vehement love and ardour.  Be merciful unto me, O Jesus, good, sweet, and kind, and grant unto Thy poor suppliant to feel sometimes, in Holy Communion, though it be but a little, the cordial affection of Thy love, that my faith may grow stronger, my hope in Thy goodness increase, and my charity, once kindled within me by the tasting of the heavenly manna, may never fail. 3. But Thy mercy is able even to grant me the grace which I long for, and to visit me most tenderly with the spirit of fervour when the day of Thy good pleasure shall come.  For, although I burn not with desire so vehement as theirs who are specially devout towards Thee, yet, through Thy grace, I have a desire after that greatly inflamed desire, praying and desiring to be made partaker with all those who so fervently love Thee, and to be numbered among their holy company. (1) Luke xxiv. 32. CHAPTER XV That the grace of devotion is acquired by humility and self-denial The Voice of the Beloved Thou oughtest to seek earnestly the grace of devotion, to ask it fervently, to wait for it patiently and faithfully, to receive it gratefully, to preserve it humbly, to work with it diligently, and to leave to God the time and manner of heavenly visitation until it come.  Chiefly oughtest thou to humble thyself when thou feelest inwardly little or no devotion, yet not to be too much cast down, nor to grieve out of measure.  God ofttimes giveth in one short moment what He hath long time denied; He sometimes giveth at the end what at the beginning of prayer He hath deferred to give. 2. If grace were always given immediately, and were at hand at the wish, it would be hardly bearable to weak man.  Wherefore the grace of devotion is to be waited for with a good hope and with humble patience.  Yet impute it to thyself and to thy sins when it is not given, or when it is mysteriously taken away.  It is sometimes a small thing which hindereth and hideth grace; (if indeed that ought to be called small and not rather great, which hindereth so great a good); but if thou remove this, be it small or great, and perfectly overcome it, thou wilt have what thou hast asked. 3. For immediately that thou hast given thyself unto God with all thine heart, and hast sought neither this nor that according to thine own will and pleasure, but hast altogether settled thyself in Him, thou shalt find thyself united and at peace; because nothing shall give thee so sweet relish and delight, as the good pleasure of the Divine will.  Whosoever therefore shall have lifted up his will unto God with singleness of heart, and shall have delivered himself from every inordinate love or dislike of any created thing, he will be the most fit for receiving grace, and worthy of the gift of devotion.  For where the Lord findeth empty vessels,(1) there giveth He His blessing.  And the more perfectly a man forsaketh things which cannot profit, and the more he dieth to himself, the more quickly doth grace come, the more plentifully doth it enter in, and the higher doth it lift up the free heart. 4. Then shall he see, and flow together, and wonder, and his heart shall be enlarged within him,(2) because the hand of the Lord is with him, and he hath put himself wholly in His hand, even for ever.  Lo, thus shall the man be blessed, that seeketh God with all his heart, and receiveth not his soul in vain.  This man in receiving the Holy Eucharist obtaineth the great grace of Divine Union; because he hath not regard to his own devotion and comfort, but, above all devotion and comfort, to the glory and honour of God. (1) 2 Kings iv.   (2) Isaiah lx. 5. CHAPTER XVI That we ought to lay open our necessities to Christ and to require His Grace The Voice of the Disciple O most sweet and loving Lord, whom now I devoutly desire to receive, Thou knowest my infirmity and the necessity which I suffer, in what evils and vices I lie; how often I am weighed down, tempted, disturbed, and defiled.  I come unto Thee for remedy, I beseech of Thee consolation and support.  I speak unto Thee who knowest all things, to whom all my secrets are open, and who alone art able perfectly to comfort and help me.  Thou knowest what good thing I most stand in need of, and how poor I am in virtues. 2. Behold, I stand poor and naked before Thee, requiring grace, and imploring mercy.  Refresh the hungry suppliant, kindle my coldness with the fire of Thy love, illuminate my blindness with the brightness of Thy presence.  Turn thou all earthly things into bitterness for me, all grievous and contrary things into patience, all things worthless and created into contempt and oblivion.  Lift up my heart unto Thee in Heaven, and suffer me not to wander over the earth.  Be Thou alone sweet unto me from this day forward for ever, because Thou alone art my meat and drink, my love and joy, my sweetness and my whole good. 3. Oh that Thou wouldest altogether by Thy presence, kindle, consume, and transform me into Thyself; that I may be made one spirit with Thee, by the grace of inward union, and the melting of earnest love!  Suffer me not to go away from Thee hungry and dry; but deal mercifully with me, as oftentimes Thou hast dealt wondrously with Thy saints.  What marvel if I should be wholly kindled from Thee, and in myself should utterly fail, since Thou art fire always burning and never failing, love purifying the heart and enlightening the understanding. CHAPTER XVII Of fervent love and vehement desire of receiving Christ The Voice of the Disciple With the deepest devotion and fervent love, with all affection and fervour of heart, I long to receive Thee, O Lord, even as many Saints and devout persons have desired Thee in communicating, who were altogether well pleasing to Thee by their sanctity of life, and dwelt in all ardent devotion.  O my God, Eternal Love, my whole Good, Happiness without measure, I long to receive Thee with the most vehement desire and becoming reverence which any Saint ever had or could have. 2. And although I be unworthy to have all those feelings of devotion, yet do I offer Thee the whole affection of my heart, even as though I alone had all those most grateful inflamed desires.  Yea, also, whatsoever things a pious mind is able to conceive and long for, all these with the deepest veneration and inward fervour do I offer and present unto Thee.  I desire to reserve nothing unto myself, but freely and entirely to offer myself and all that I have unto Thee for a sacrifice.  O Lord my God, my Creator and Redeemer! with such affection, reverence, praise, and honour, with such gratitude, worthiness, and love, with such faith, hope, and purity do I desire to receive Thee this day, as Thy most blessed Mother, the glorious Virgin Mary, received and desired Thee, when she humbly and devoutly answered the Angel who brought unto her the glad tidings of the mystery of the Incarnation.  Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word.(1) 3. And as Thy blessed forerunner, the most excellent of Saints, John Baptist, being full of joy in Thy presence, leapt while yet in the womb of his mother, for joy in the Holy Ghost; and afterwards discerning Jesus walking amongst men, humbled himself exceedingly, and said, with devout affection, The friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice;(2) even so I wish to be inflamed with great and holy desires, and to present myself unto Thee with my whole heart.  Whence also, on behalf of myself and of all commended to me in prayer, I offer and present unto Thee the jubilation of all devout hearts, their ardent affections, their mental ecstasies, and supernatural illuminations and heavenly visions, with all the virtues and praises celebrated and to be celebrated by every creature in heaven and earth; to the end that by all Thou mayest worthily be praised and glorified for ever. 4. Receive my prayers, O Lord my God, and my desires of giving Thee infinite praise and unbounded benediction, which, according to the multitude of Thine unspeakable greatness, are most justly due unto Thee.  These do I give Thee, and desire to give every day and every moment; and with beseechings and affectionate desires I call upon all celestial spirits and all Thy faithful people to join with me in rendering Thee thanks and praises. 5. Let all peoples, nations, and tongues praise Thee, and magnify Thy holy and sweet-sounding Name, with highest jubilations and ardent devotion.  And let all who reverently and devoutly celebrate Thy most high Sacrament, and receive it with full assurance of faith, be accounted worthy to find grace and mercy with Thee, and intercede with all supplication for me a sinner; and when they shall have attained unto their wished-for devotion and joyous union with Thee, and shall depart full of comfort and wondrously refreshed from Thy holy, heavenly table, let them vouchsafe to be mindful of me, for I am poor and needy. (1) Luke i. 38.   (2) John iii. 29. CHAPTER XVIII That a man should not be a curious searcher of the Sacrament, but a humble imitator of Christ, submitting his sense to holy faith The Voice of the Beloved Thou must take heed of curious and useless searching into this most profound Sacrament, if thou wilt not be plunged into the abyss of doubt.  He that is a searcher of Majesty shall be oppressed by the glory thereof.(1)  God is able to do more than man can understand.  A pious and humble search after truth is to be allowed, when it is always ready to be taught, and striving to walk after the wholesome opinions of the fathers. 2. Blessed is the simplicity which leaveth alone the difficult paths of questionings, and followeth the plain and firm steps of God's commandments.  Many have lost devotion whilst they sought to search into deeper things.  Faith is required of thee, and a sincere life, not loftiness of intellect, nor deepness in the mysteries of God.  If thou understandest not nor comprehendest the things which are beneath thee, how shalt thou comprehend those which are above thee?  Submit thyself unto God, and humble thy sense to faith, and the light of knowledge shall be given thee, as shall be profitable and necessary unto thee. 3. There are some who are grievously tempted concerning faith and the Sacrament; but this is not to be imputed to themselves but rather to the enemy.  Care not then for this, dispute not with thine own thoughts, nor make answer to the doubts which are cast into thee by the devil; but believe the words of God, believe His Saints and Prophets, and the wicked enemy shall flee from thee. Often it profiteth much, that the servant of God endureth such things.  For the enemy tempteth not unbelievers and sinners, because he already hath secure possession of them; but he tempteth and harasseth the faithful and devout by various means. 4. Go forward therefore with simple and undoubting faith, and draw nigh unto the Sacrament with supplicating reverence.  And whatsoever thou art not enabled to understand, that commit without anxiety to Almighty God.  God deceiveth thee not; he is deceived who believeth too much in himself.  God walketh with the simple, revealeth Himself to the humble, giveth understanding to babes, openeth the sense to pure minds, and hideth grace from the curious and proud.  Human reason is weak and may be deceived; but true faith cannot be deceived. 5. All reason and natural investigation ought to follow faith, not to precede, nor to break it.  For faith and love do here especially take the highest place, and work in hidden ways in this most holy and exceeding excellent Sacrament.  God who is eternal and incomprehensible, and of infinite power, doth great and inscrutable things in heaven and in earth, and His wonderful works are past finding out.  If the works of God were of such sort that they might easily be comprehended by human reason, they should no longer be called wonderful or unspeakable. (1) Proverbs xxv. 27 (Vulg.).

Come, masters, I think it be past five a clock; is it not time we were at work: my old Master he'll be stirring anon. FIRST SMITH. I cannot tell whether my old master will be stirring or no:  but I am sure I can hardly take my afternoon's nap, for my young Master Thomas, he keeps such a quile in his study, with the Sun, and the Moon, and the seven stars, that I do verily think he'll read out his wife. HODGE. He skill of the stars! there's good-man Car of Fulhum, he that carried us to the strong Ale, where goody Trundell had her maid got with child:  O he knows the stars.  He'll tickle you Charles Waine in nine degrees. That same man will tell you goody Trundell when her Ale shall miscarry, only by the stars. SECOND SMITH. Aye, that's a great virtue; indeed I think Thomas be no body in comparison to him. FIRST SMITH. Well, masters, come, shall we to our hammers? HODGE. Aye, content; first let's take our morning's draught, and then to work roundly. SECOND SMITH. Aye, agreed; go in, Hodge. [Exit omnes.] ACT I. SCENE II. The same. [Enter young Cromwell.] CROMWELL. Good morrow, morn, I do salute thy brightness. The night seems tedious to my troubled soul, Whose black obscurity binds in my mind A thousand sundry cogitations: And now Aurora, with a lively dye, Adds comfort to my spirit that mounts on high-- Too high indeed, my state being so mean. My study, like a mineral of gold, Makes my heart proud, wherein my hopes enrolled; My books is all the wealth I do possess. [Here within they must beat with their hammers.] And unto them I have engaged my heart. O learning, how divine thou seems to me: Within whose arms is all felicity. Peace with your hammers! leave your knocking there: You do disturb my study and my rest. Leave off, I say, you mad me with the noise. [Enter Hodge and the two Men.] HODGE. Why, how now, Master Thomas, how now?  Will you not let us work for you? CROMWELL. You fret my heart, with making of this noise. HODGE. How, fret your heart?  Aye, but Thomas, you'll fret your father's purse if you let us from working. SECOND SMITH. Aye, this tis for him to make him a gentleman.  Shall we leave work for your musing? that's well, I faith; But here comes my old master now. [Enter Old Cromwell.] OLD CROMWELL. You idle knaves, what, are you loitering now? No hammers walking and my work to do! What, not a heat among your work to day? HODGE. Marry, sir, your son Thomas will not let us work at all. OLD CROMWELL. Why, knave, I say, have I thus carked & car'd And all to keep thee like a gentleman; And dost thou let my servants at their work, That sweat for thee, knave, labour thus for thee? CROMWELL. Father, their hammers do offend my study. OLD CROMWELL. Out of my doors, knave, if thou likest it not. I cry you mercy! is your ears so fine? I tell thee, knave, these get when I do sleep; I will not have my Anvil stand for thee. CROMWELL. There's money, father, I will pay your men. [He throws money among them.] OLD CROMWELL. Have I thus brought thee up unto my cost, In hope that one day thou wouldst relieve my age, And art thou now so lavish of thy coin, To scatter it among these idle knaves. CROMWELL. Father, be patient, and content your self. The time will come I shall hold gold as trash: And here I speak with a presaging soul, To build a palace where now this cottage stands, As fine as is King Henry's house at Sheene. OLD CROMWELL. You build a house! you knave, you'll be a beggar. Now, afore God, all is but cast away, That is bestowed upon this thriftless lad. Well, had I bound him to some honest trade, This had not been, but it was his mother's doing, To send him to the University. How? build a house where now this cottage stands, As fair as that at Sheene!--[Aside.]  He shall not hear me. A good boy Tom!  I con thee thank Tom! Well said Tom! gramarcies Tom!-- Into your work, knaves; hence, you saucy boy. [Exit all but young Cromwell.] CROMWELL. Why should my birth keep down my mounting spirit? Are not all creatures subject unto time: To time, who doth abuse the world, And fills it full of hodge-podge bastardy? There's legions now of beggars on the earth, That their original did spring from Kings: And many Monarchs now whose fathers were The riffe-raffe of their age:  for Time and Fortune Wears out a noble train to beggary, And from the hunghill minions do advance To state and mark in this admiring world. This is but course, which in the name of Fate Is seen as often as it whirls about: The River Thames, that by our door doth pass, His first beginning is but small and shallow: Yet keeping on his course, grows to a sea. And likewise Wolsey, the wonder of our age, His birth as mean as mine, a Butcher's son, Now who within this land a greater man? Then, Cromwell, cheer thee up, and tell thy soul, That thou maist live to flourish and control. [Enter Old Cromwell.] OLD CROMWELL. Tom Cromwell! what, Tom, I say! CROMWELL. Do you call, sir. OLD CROMWELL. Here is master Bowser come to know if you have dispatched his petition for the Lords of the counsel or no. CROMWELL. Father, I have; please you to call him in. OLD CROMWELL. That's well said, Tom; a good lad, Tom. [Enter Master Bowser.] BOWSER. Now, Master Cromwell, have you dispatched this petition? CROMWELL. I have, sir; here it is:  please you peruse it. BOWSER. It shall not need; we'll read it as we go by water: And, Master Cromwell, I have made a motion May do you good, and if you like of it. Our Secretary at Antwerp, sir, is dead, And the Merchants there hath sent to me, For to provide a man fit for the place: Now I do know none fitter than your self, If with your liking it stand, master Cromwell. CROMWELL. With all my heart, sir, and I much am bound, In love and duty for your kindness shown. OLD CROMWELL. Body of me, Tom, make haste, least some body get between thee and home, Tom.  I thank you, good master Bowser, I thank you for my boy; I thank you always, I thank you most heartily, sir. Ho, a cup of Beer there for master Bowser. BOWSER. It shall not need, sir.  Master Cromwell, will you go? CROMWELL. I will attend you, sir. OLD CROMWELL. Farewell, Tom; God bless thee, Tom; God speed thee, good Tom. [Exit omnes.] ACT I. SCENE III. London.  A street before Frescobald's house. [Enter Bagot, a Broker, solus.] BAGOT. I hope this day is fatal unto some, And by their loss must Bagot seek to gain. This is the lodging of master Friskiball, A liberal Merchant, and a Florentine, To whom Banister owes a thousand pound, A Merchant Banckrout, whose Father was my master. What do I care for pity or regard? He once was wealthy, but he now is fallen, And this morning have I got him arrested, At the suit of master Friskiball, And by this means shall I be sure of coin, For doing this same good to him unknown: And in good time, see where the merchant comes. [Enter Friskiball.] BAGOT. Good morrow to kind master Friskiball. FRISKIBALL. Good morrow to your self, good master Bagot, And what's the news, you are so early stirring: It is for gain, I make no doubt of that. BAGOT. It is for the love, sir, that I bear to you. When did you see your debtor Banister? FRISKIBALL. I promise you, I have not seen the man This two months day; his poverty is such, As I do think he shames to see his friends. BAGOT. Why, then, assure your self to see him straight, For at your suit I have arrested him, And here they will be with him presently. FRISKIBALL. Arrest him at my suit? you were to blame. I know the man's misfortune to be such, As he's not able for to pay the debt, And were it known to some he were undone. BAGOT. This is your pitiful heart to think it so, But you are much deceived in Banister. Why such as he will break for fashion sake, And unto those they owe a thousand pound, Pay scarce a hundred.  O, sir, beware of him. The man is lewdly given to Dice and Drabs, Spends all he hath in harlots' companies; It is no mercy for to pity him. I speak the truth of him, for nothing else, But for the kindness that I bear to you. FRISKIBALL. If it be so, he hath deceived me much, And to deal strictly with such a one as he-- Better severe than too much lenity. But here is Master Banister himself, And with him, as I take, the officers. [Enter Banister, his wife, and two officers.] BANISTER. O master Friskiball, you have undone me. My state was well nigh overthrown before, Now altogether down-cast by your means. MISTRESS BANISTER. O master Friskiball, pity my husband's case. he is a man hath lived as well as any, Till envious fortune and the ravenous sea Did rob, disrobe, and spoil us of our own. FRISKIBALL. Mistress Banister, I envy not your husband, Nor willingly would I have used him thus, But that I hear he is so lewdly given, Haunts wicked company, and hath enough To pay his debts, yet will not be known thereof. BANISTER. This is that damned Broker, that same Bagot, Whom I have often from my Frencher fed. Ingrateful Villain for to use me thus! BAGOT. What I have said to him is naught but truth. MISTRESS BANISTER. What thou hast said springs from an envious heart. A Cannibal that doth eat men alive! But here upon my knee, believe me, sir, And what I speak, so help me God, is true: We scarce have meat to feed our little babes. Most of our Plate is in that Broker's hand, Which, had we money to defray our debt, O think,. we would not bide that penury. Be merciful, kind master Friskiball. My husband, children, and my self will eat But one meal a day, the other will We keep and sell As part to pay the debt we owe to you: If ever tears did pierce a tender mind, Be pitiful, let me some favour find. BAGOT. Be not you so mad, sir, to believe her tears. FRISKIBALL. Go to, I see thou art an envious man. Good mistress Banister, kneel not to me; I pray rise up, you shall have your desire. Hold; officers, be gone, there's for your pains.-- You know you owe to me a thousand pound: Here, take my hand; if ear God make you able, And place you in your former state again, Pay me:  but if still your fortune frown, Upon my faith I'll never ask you crown: I never yet did wrong to men in thrall, For God doth know what to my self may fall. BANISTER. This unexpected favour, undeserved, Doth make my heart bleed inwardly with joy. Ne'er may ought prosper with me is my own, If I forget this kindness you have shown. MISTRESS BANISTER. My children in their prayers, both night and day, For your good fortune and success shall pray. FRISKIBALL. I thank you both; I pray, do dine with me. Within these three days, if God give me leave, I will to Florence, to my native home. Bagot, hold; there's a Portague to drink, Although you ill deserved it by your merit. Give not such cruel scope unto your heart; Be sure the ill you do will be requited. Remember what I say, Bagot; farewell. Come, Master Banister; you shall with me. My fare is but simple, but welcome heartily. [Exit all but Bagot.] BAGOT. A plague go with you; would you had eat your last! Is this the thanks I have for all my pains? Confusion light upon you all for me. Where he had wont to give a score of crowns, Doth he now foist me with a Portague? Well, I will be revenged upon this Banister. I'll to his creditors, buy all the debts he owes, As seeming that I do it for good will. I am sure to have them at an easy rate, And when tis done, in christendom he stays not, But I'll make his heart to ache with sorrow: And if that Banister become my debtor, By heaven and earth I'll make his plague the greater. [Exit Bagot.] ACT II. [Enter Chorus.] CHORUS. Now, gentlemen, imagine that young Cromwell is In Antwerp ledger for the English Merchants: And Banister, to shun this Bagot's hate, Hearing that he hath got some of his debts, Is fled to Antwerp, with his wife and children; Which Bagot hearing is gone after them: And thither sends his bills of debt before, To be revenged on wretched Banister. What doth fall out, with patience sit and see, A just requital of false treachery. [Exit.] ACT II. SCENE I. Antwerp. [Cromwell in his study with bags of money before him casting of account.] CROMWELL. Thus far my reckoning doth go straight & even, But, Cromwell, this same ployding fits not thee: Thy mind is altogether set on travel, And not to live thus cloistered like a Nun. It is not this same trash that i regard, Experience is the jewel of my heart. [Enter a Post.] POST. I pray, sir, are you ready to dispatch me? CROMWELL. Yes; here's those sums of money you must carry; You go so far as Frankford, do you not? POST. I do, sir. CROMWELL. Well, prithee make all the hate thou canst, For there be certain English gentlemen Are bound for Venice, and my happily want, And if that you should linger by the way: But in hope that you'll make good speed, There's two Angels to buy you spurs and wands. POST. I thank you, sir; this will add wings indeed. [Exit Post.] CROMWELL. Gold is of power would make an Eagle speed. [Enter Mistress Banister.] What gentlewoman is this that grieves so much? It seems she doth address her self to me. MISTRESS BANISTER. God save you, sir, sir; pray, is your name master Cromwell? CROMWELL. My name is Thomas Cromwell, gentlewoman. MISTRESS BANISTER. Know you not one Bagot, sir, that's come to Antwerp? CROMWELL. No, trust me, I never saw the man, But here are bills of debt I have received, Against one Banister, a Merchant fallen into decay. MISTRESS BANISTER. Into decay, indeed, long of that wretch. I am the wife to woeful Banister: And by that bloody villain am pursued From London here to Antwerp. My husband he is in the governour's hands, And God no doubt will treble bless your gain. CROMWELL. Good mistress Banister, what I can, I will, In any thing that lies within my power. MISTRESS BANISTER. O speak to Bagot, that same wicked wretch, An Angel's voice may move a damned devil. CROMWELL. Why, is he come to Antwerp, as you here? MISTRESS BANISTER. I heard he landed some two hours since. CROMWELL. Well, mistress Banister, assure your self. I'll speak to Bagot in your own behalf, And win him to all the pity that I can. Mean time, to comfort you in your distress, Receive these Angels to relieve your need, And be assured that what I can effect To do you good, no way I will neglect. MISTRESS BANISTER. That mighty God, that knows each mortal's heart, Keep you from trouble, sorrow, grief, and smart. [Exit Mistress Banister.] CROMWELL. Thanks, courteous woman, for thy hearty prayer. It grieves my soul to see her misery, But we that live under the work of fate, May hope the best, yet knows not to what state Our stars and destinies hath us assigned. Fickle is fortune and her face is blind. [Exit.] ACT II. SCENE II. A street in Antwerp. [Enter Bagot solus.] BAGOT. So all goes well; it is as I would have it. Banister he is with the Governour And shortly shall have guives upon his heels. It glads my heart to think upon the slave; I hope to have his body rot in prison, And after here his wife to hang her self, And all his children die for want of food. The Jewels that I have brought to Antwerp Are recond to be worth five thousand pound, Which scarcely stood me in three hundreth pound. I bought them at an easy kind of rate; I care not which way they came by them That sold them me, it comes not near my heart: And least thy should be stolen--as sure they are-- I thought it meet to sell them here in Antwerp, And so have left them in the Governour's hand, Who offers me within two hundreth pound Of all my price.  But now no more of that: I must go see and if my bills be safe, The which I sent to master Cromwell, That if the wind should keep me on the sea, He might arrest him here before I came: [Enter Cromwell.] And in good time, see where he is.  God save you sir. CROMWELL. And you:  pray pardon me, I know you not. BAGOT. It may be so, sir, but my name is Bagot, The man that sent to you the bills of debt. CROMWELL. O, the man that pursues Banister. Here are the bills of debt you sent to me: As for the man, you know best where he is. It is reported you have a flinty heart, A mind that will not stoop to any pity, An eye that knows not how to shed a tear, A hand that's always open for reward; But, master Bagot, would you be ruled by me, You should turn all these to the contrary. Your heart should still have feeling of remorse, Your mind according to your state be liberal To those that stand in need and in distress; Your hand to help them that do stand in want, Rather than with your poise to hold them down; For every ill turn show your self more kind; Thus should I do; pardon, I speak my mind. BAGOT. Aye, sir, you speak to hear what I would say, But you must live, I know, as well as I: I know this place to be extortion, And tis not for a man to keep him, But he must lie, cog with his dearest friend, And as for pity, scorn it, hate all conscience. But yet I do commend your wit in this, To make a show of what I hope you are not; But I commend you and tis well done: This is the only way to bring your gain. CROMWELL. My gain!  I had rather chain me to an oar, And like a slave there toil out all my life, Before I'd live so base a slave as thou: I, like an hypocrite, to make a show Of seeming virtue and a devil within! No, Bagot, would thy conscience were as clear: Poor Banister ne'er had been troubled here. BAGOT. Nay, good master Cromwell; be not angry, sir. I know full well you are no such man; But if your conscience were as white as Snow, It will be thought that you are other wise. CROMWELL. Will it be thought that I am other wise? Let them that think so know they are deceived. Shall Cromwell live to have his faith misconstered? Antwerp, for all the wealth within thy Town, I will not stay here not two hours longer. As good luck serves, my accounts are all made even; Therefore I'll straight unto the treasurer. Bagot, I know you'll to the governour; Commend me to him, say I am bound to travail, To see the fruitful parts of Italy, And as you ever bore a Christian mind, Let Banister some favour of you find. BAGOT. For your sake, sir, I'll help him all I can-- [Aside.] To starve his heart out ere he get a groat. So, master Cromwell, do I take my leave, For I must straight unto the governour. [Exit Bagot.] CROMWELL. Farewell, sir; pray you remember what I said.-- No, Cromwell, no; thy heart was ne'er so base, To live by falsehood or by brokery! But 't falles out well, I little it repent; Hereafter, time in travel shall be spent. [Enter Hodge, his father's man.] HODGE. Your son Thomas, quoth you:  I have been Thomast! I had thought it had been no such matter to a gone by water:  for at Putney I'll go you to Parish-garden for two pence, sit as still as may be, without any wagging or jolting in my guts, in a little boat too:  here we were scarce four mile in the great green water, but I--thinking to go to my afternoon's urgings, as twas my manner at home--but I felt a kind of rising in my guts.  At last one a the Sailors spying of me, be a good cheer, says he, set down thy victuals, and up with it, thou hast nothing but an Eel in thy belly.  Well toot went I, to my victuals went the Sailors, and thinking me to be a man of better experience than any in the ship, asked me what Wood the ship was made of:  they all swore I told them as right as if I had been acquainted with the Carpenter that made it.  At last we grew near land, and I grew villainous hungry, went to my bag:  the devil a bit there was.  The Sailors had tickled me; yet I cannot blame them:  it was a part of kindness, for I in kindness told them what Wood the ship was made of, and they in kindness eat up my victuals, as indeed one good turn asketh another.  Well, would I could find my master Thomas in this Dutch Town; he might put some English Beer into my belly. CROMWELL. What, Hodge, my father's man? by my hand, welcome! How doth my father? what's the news at home? HODGE. Master Thomas, O God, master Thomas, your hand, glove and all.  This is to give you to understanding that your father is in health, and Alice Downing here hath sent you a Nutmeg, & Bess Makewater a race of Ginger; my fellow Will & Tom hath between them sent you a dozen of points, & good man Tolle of the Goat a pair of mittens; my self came in person:  and this is all the news. CROMWELL. Gramarcy, good Hodge, and thou art welcome to me, But in as ill a time thou comest as may be: For I am travelling into Italy. What sayest thou, Hodge? wilt thou bear me company? HODGE. Will I bear thee company, Tom?  What tell'st me of Italy? were it to the furthest part of Flanders, I would go with thee, Tom.  I am thine in all weal and woe, thy own to command.  What, Tom!  I have passed the rigorous waves of Neptune's blasts; I tell you, Thomas, I have been in the danger of the floods; and when I have seen Boreas begin to play the Ruffin with us, then would I down of my knees and call upon Vulcan. CROMWELL. And why upon him? HODGE. Because, as this same fellow Neptune is God of the Seas, so Vulcan is Lord over the Smiths, and therefore, I, being a Smith, thought his Godhead would have some care yet of me. CROMWELL. A good conceit, but tell me, hast thou dined yet? HODGE. Thomas, to speak the truth, not a bit yet I. CROMWELL. Come, go with me; thou shalt have cheer good store. And farewell, Antwerp, if I come no more. HODGE. I follow thee, sweet Tom, I follow thee. [Exit omnes.] ACT II. SCENE III. Another street in the same. [Enter the Governour of the English house, Bagot, Banister, his wife, and two officers.] GOVERNOUR. Is Cromwell gone then, say you, master Bagot? What dislike, I pray? what was the cause? BAGOT. To tell you true, a wild brain of his own; Such youth as they cannot see when they are well: He is all bent to travail, that's his reason, And doth not love to eat his bread at home. GOVERNOUR. Well, good fortune with him, if the man be gone. We hardly shall find such a one as he, To fit our turns; his dealings were so honest. But now, sir, for your Jewels that I have, What do you say? will you take my prise? BAGOT. O, sir, you offer too much underfoot. GOVERNOUR. Tis but two hundred pound between us, man. What's that in payment of five thousand pound? BAGOT. Two hundred pound! birlady, sir, tis great: Before I got so much, it made me sweat. GOVERNOUR. Well, Master Bagot, I'll profer you fairly. You see this Merchant, master Banister, Is going now to prison at your suit. His substance all is gone; what would you have? Yet in regard I knew the man of wealth-- Never dishonest dealing, but such mishaps Hath fallen on him, may light on me or you-- There is two hundred pound between us; We will divide the same:  I'll give you one, On that condition you will set him free: His state is nothing, that you see your self, And where naught is, the King must lose his right. BAGOT. Sir, sir, you speak out of your love, Tis foolish love, sir, sure, to pity him: Therefore, content your self; this is my mind: To do him good I will not bate a penny. BANISTER. This is my comfort:  though thou doost no good, A mighty ebb follows a mighty flood. MISTRESS BANISTER. O thou base wretch, whom we have fostered Even as a Serpent for to poison us, If God did ever right a woman's wrong, To that same God I bend and bow my heart, To let his heavy wrath fall on thy head, By whom my hopes and joys are butchered. BAGOT. Alas, fond woman, I pray thee, pray thy worst; The Fox fares better still when he is curst. [Enter Master Bowser, a Merchant.] GOVERNOUR. Master Bowser! you're welcome, sir, from England. What's the best news? how doth all our friends? BOWSER. They are all well and do commend them to you: There's letters from your brother and your son: So fair you well, sir; I must take my leave. My haste and business doth require such. GOVERNOUR. Before you dine, sir?  What, go you out of town? BOWSER. Aye, faith, unless I hear some news in town, I must away; there is no remedy. GOVERNOUR. Master Bowser, what is your business? may I know it? BOWSER. You may, sir, and so shall all the City. The King of late hath had his treasury robbed, And of the choicest jewels that he had: The value of them was some seven thousand pound. The fellow that did steal these jewels, he is hanged, And did confess that for three hundred pound He sold them to one Bagot dwelling in London: Now Bagot's fled, and, as we hear, to Antwerp, And hither am I come to seek him out; And they that first can tell me of his news Shall have a hundred pound for their reward. BANISTER. How just is God to right the innocent. GOVERNOUR. Master Bowser, you come in happy time: Here is the villain Bagot that you seek, And all those jewels have I in my hands. Officers, look to him, hold him fast. BAGOT. The devil ought me a shame, and now hath paid it. BOWSER. Is this that Bagot? fellows, bear him hence. We will not now stand for his reply. Lade him with Irons; we will have him tried In England, where his villainies are known. BAGOT. Mischief, confusion, light upon you all! O hang me, drown me, let me kill my self! Let go my arms; let me run quick to hell. BOWSER. Away, bear him away; stop the slave's mouth. [They carry him away.] MISTRESS BANISTER. Thy works are infinite, great God of heaven. GOVERNOUR. I heard this Bagot was a wealthy fellow. BOWSER. He was indeed, for when his goods were seized, Of Jewels, coin, and Plate within his house, Was found the value of five thousand pound; His furniture fully worth half so much, Which being all strained for, for the King, He frankly gave it to the Antwerp merchants, And they again, out of their bounteous mind, Hath to a brother of their company, A man decayed by fortune of the Seas, Given Bagot's wealth, to set him up again, And keep it for him:  his name is Banister. GOVERNOUR. Master Bowser, with this happy news You have revived two from the gates of death: This is that Banister, and this his wife. BOWSER. Sir, I am glad my fortune is so good, To bring such tidings as may comfort you. BANISTER. You have given life unto a man deemed dead, For by these news, my life is newly bred. MISTRESS BANISTER. Thanks to my God, next to my Sovereign King, And last to you that these good hopes doth bring. GOVERNOUR. The hundred pound I must receive as due For finding Bagot, I freely give to you. BOWSER. And, Master Banister, if so you please, I'll bear you company, when you cross the Seas. BANISTER. If it please you, sir; my company is but mean. Stands with your liking, I'll wait on you. GOVERNOUR. I am glad that all things do accord so well: Come, Master Bowser, let us in to dinner: And, Mistress Banister, be merry, woman! Come, after sorrow now let's cheer your spirit; Knaves have their due, and you but what you merit. [Exit omnes.] ACT III. SCENE I. The principal bridge at Florence. [Enter Cromwell and Hodge in their shirts, and without Hats.] HODGE. Call ye this seeing of fashions?  Marry, would I had stayed at Putney still.  O, Master Thomas, we are spoiled, we are gone. CROMWELL. Content thee, man, this is but fortune. HODGE. Fortune; a plague of this Fortune makes me go wetshod; the rogues would not leave me a shoe to my feet.  For my hose, they scorned them with their heels; but for my Doublet and Hat, O Lord, they embraced me, and unlaced me, and took away my clothes, and so disgraced me. CROMWELL. Well, Hodge, what remedy?  What shift shall we make now? HODGE. Nay, I know not.  For begging I am naught, for stealing worse: by my troth, I must even fall to my old trade, to the Hammer and the Horse heels again:  but now the worst is, I am not acquainted with the humor of the horses in this country, whether they are not coltish, given much to kicking, or no; for when I have one leg in my hand, if he should up and lay tother on my chops, I were gone:  there lay I, there lay Hodge. CROMWELL. Hodge, I believe thou must work for us both. HODGE. O, Master Thomas, have not I told you of this? have not I many a time and often said, Tom, or Master Thomas, learn to make a Horse-shoe, it will be your own another day:  this was not regarded.  Hark you, Thomas, what do you call the fellows that robbed us? CROMWELL. The Bandetti. HODGE. The Bandetti, do you call them?  I know not what they are called here, but I am sure we call them plain thieves in England.  O Thomas, that we were now at Putney, at the ale there. CROMWELL. Content thee, man; here set up these two bills, And let us keep our standing on the bridge: The fashion of this country is such, If any stranger be oppressed with want, To write the manner of his misery, And such as are disposed to succour him, Will do it.  What, hast thou set them up? HODGE. Aye, they're up; God send some to read them, and not only to read them, but also to look on us; and not altogether to look on us, [One stands at one end, and one at tother.] But to relieve us.  O cold, cold, cold. [Enter Friskiball, the Merchant, and reads the bills.] FRISKIBALL. What's here? two Englishmen robbed by the Bandetti! One of them seems to be a gentleman. Tis pity that his fortune was so hard, To fall into the desperate hands of thieves. I'll question him of what estate he is. God save you, sir; are you an Englishman? CROMWELL. I am, sir, a distress Englishman. FRISKIBALL. And what are you, my friend? HODGE. Who?  I, sir? by my troth, I do not know my self what I am now, but, sir, I was a smith, sir, a poor Farrier of Putney.  That's my master, sir, yonder.  I was robbed for his sake, sir. FRISKIBALL. I see you have been met by the Bandetti, And therefore need not ask how you came thus. But, Friskiball, why doost thou question them Of their estate and not relieve their need? Sir, the coin I have about me is not much: There's sixteen Ducats for to clothe your selves, There's sixteen more to buy your diet with, And there's sixteen to pay for your horse hire: Tis all the wealth, you see, my purse possesses, But if you please for to enquire me out, You shall not want for ought that I can do. My name is Friskiball, a Florence Merchant, A man that always loved your nation. CROMWELL. This unexpected favour at your hands, Which God doth know if ever I shall requite it-- Necessity makes me to take your bounty, And for your gold can yield you naught but thanks. Your charity hath helped me from despair; Your name shall still be in my hearty prayer. FRISKIBALL. It is not worth such thanks.  Come to my house; Your want shall better be relieved then thus. CROMWELL. I pray, excuse me; this shall well suffice To bear my charges to Bononia, Whereas a noble Earl is much distressed: An Englishman, Russell, the Earl of Bedford, Is by the French King sold unto his death: It may fall out, that I may do him good; To save his life, I'll hazard my heart blood. Therefore, kind sir, thanks for your liberal gift; I must be gone to aide him; there's no shift. FRISKIBALL. I'll be no hinderer to so good an act. Heaven prosper you in that you go about! If Fortune bring you this way back again, Pray let me see you:  so I take my leave; All good a man can wish, I do bequeath. [Exit Friskiball.] CROMWELL. All good that God doth send light on your head; There's few such men within our climate bred. How say you now, Hodge? is not this good fortune? HODGE. How say you?  I'll tell you what, master Thomas; if all men be of this Gentleman's mind, let's keep our standings upon this Bridge:  we shall get more here with begging in one day, than I shall with making Horseshoes in a whole year. CROMWELL. No Hodge, we must begone unto Bononia, There to relieve the noble Earl of Bedford: Where, if I fail not in my policy, I shall deceive their subtle treachery. HODGE. Nay, I'll follow you.  God bless us from the thieving Bandettoes again. [Exit omnes.] ACT III. SCENE II. A room in an hotel. [Enter Bedford and his Host.] BEDFORD. Am I betrayed? was Bedford born to die By such base slaves in such a place as this? Have I escaped so many times in France, So many battles have I over passed, And made the French stir when they heard my name; And am I now betrayed unto my death? Some of their hearts' blood first shall pay for it. HOST. They do desire, my Lord, to speak with you. BEDFORD. The traitors do desire to have my blood, But by my birth, my honour, and my name, By all my hopes, my life shall cost them dear. Open the door; I'll venture out upon them, And if I must die, then I'll die with honour. HOST. Alas, my Lord, that is a desperate course; They have begirt you round about the house; Their meaning is to take you prisoner, And so to send your body unto France. BEDFORD. First shall the Ocean be as dry as sand, Before alive they send me unto France: I'll have my body first bored like a Sieve, And die as Hector, gainst the Mirmidons, Ere France shall boast Bedford's their prisoner. Treacherous France, that, gainst the law of arms, Hath here betrayed thy enemy to death. But be assured, my blood shall be revenged Upon the best lives that remains in France.-- [Enter a Servant.] Stand back, or else thou run'st upon thy death. MESSENGER. Pardon, my Lord; I come to tell your honour, That they have hired a Neopolitan, Who by his Oratory hath promised them, Without the shedding of one drop of blood, Into their hands safe to deliver you, And therefore craves none but himself may enter And a poor swain that attends on him. [Exit servant.] BEDFORD. A Neopolitan? bid him come in. Were he as cunning in his Eloquence As Cicero, the famous man of Rome, His words would be as chaff against the wind. Sweet tongued Ulysses that made Ajax mad, Were he and his tongue in this speaker's head, Alive he wins me not; then, tis no conquest dead. [Enter Cromwell like a Neopolitan, and Hodge with him.] CROMWELL. Sir, are you the master of the house? HOST. I am, sir. CROMWELL. By this same token you must leave this place, And leave none but the Earl and I together, And this my Peasant here to tend on us. HOST. With all my heart.  God grant, you do some good. [Exit Host.  Cromwell shuts the door.] BEDFORD. Now, sir, what's you will with me? CROMWELL. Intends your honour not to yield your self? BEDFORD. No, good man goose, not while my sword doth last. Is this your eloquence for to persuade me? CROMWELL. My Lord, my eloquence is for to save you. I am not, as you judge, a Neopolitan, But Cromwell, your servant, and an Englishman. BEDFORD. How?  Cromwell? not my Farrier's son? CROMWELL. The same, sir, and am come to succour you. HODGE. Yes, faith, sir; and I am Hodge, your poor Smith. Many a time and oft have I shoed your Dapper Gray. BEDFORD. And what avails it me that thou art here? CROMWELL. It may avail, if you'll be ruled by me. My Lord, you know the men of Mantua And these Bononians are at deadly strife, And they, my Lord, both love and honour you. Could you but get out of the Mantua port, Then were you safe despite of all their force. BEDFORD. Tut, man, thou talkest of things impossible. Dost thou not see that we are round beset? How, then, is it possible we should escape? CROMWELL. By force we cannot, but by policy. Put on the apparel here that Hodge doth wear, And give him yours--the States, they know you not, For, as I think, they never saw your face-- And at a watch-word must I call them in, And will desire, that we safe may pass To Mantua, where I'll say my business lies. How doth your Honor like of this devise? BEDFORD. O wondrous good!  But wilt thou venter, Hodge? HODGE. Will I?-- O noble Lord, I do accord, In anything I can, And do agree, to set thee free, Do fortune what she can. BEDFORD. Come, then, let's change our apparel straight. CROMWELL. Go, Hodge; make haste, least they chance to call. HODGE. I warrant you I'll fit him with a suit. [Exit Earl & Hodge.] CROMWELL. Heavens grant this policy doth take success, And that the Earl may safely scape away. And yet it grieves me for this simple wretch, For fear they should offer him violence: But of two evils, tis best to shun the greatest, And better is it that he lives in thrall, Than such a Noble Earl as he should fall. Their stubborn hearts, it may be, will relent, Since he is gone to whom their hate is bent.-- My Lord, have you dispatched? [Enter Bedford like the Clown, and Hodge in his cloak and his Hat.] BEDFORD. How doost thou like us, Cromwell? is it well? CROMWELL. O, my Lord, excellent:  Hodge, how doost feel thy self? HODGE. How do I feel my self? why, as a Noble man should do. O, how I feel honor come creeping on!  My Nobility is wonderful melancholy:  Is it not most Gentlemen like to be melancholy? CROMWELL. Yes, Hodge; now go sit down in his study, and take state upon thee. HODGE. I warrant you, my Lord; let me alone to take state upon me:  but hark you, my Lord, do you feel nothing bite about you? BEDFORD. No, trust me, Hodge. HODGE. Aye, they know they want their pasture; it's a strange thing of this vermine, they dare not meddle with Nobility. CROMWELL. Go, take thy place, Hodge; I'll call them in.-- [Hodge sits in the study, and Cromwell calls in the States.] All is done, enter and if you please. [Enter the States and Officers, with Halberts.] GOVERNOUR. What, have you won him? will he yield himself? CROMWELL. I have, an't please you, and the quiet Earl Doth yield himself to be disposed by you. GOVERNOUR. Give him the money that we promised him; So let him go, whether it please himself. CROMWELL. My business, sir, lies unto Mantua, Please you to give me safe conduct thether. GOVERNOUR. Go and conduct him to the Mantua Port, And see him safe delivered presently. [Exit Cromwell and Bedford.] Go draw the curtains, let us see the Earl.-- O, he is writing; stand apart awhile. HODGE. Fellow William, I am not as I have been:  I went from you a Smith, I write to you as a Lord.  I am, at this present writing, among the Polonian Sasiges. I do commend my Lordship to Raphe & to Roger, to Bridget & to Doritie, & so to all the youth of Putney. GOVERNOUR. Sure, these are the names of English Noblemen, Some of his special friends, to whom he writes: But stay, he doth address himself to sing. [Here he sings a song.] My Lord, I am glad you are so frolic and so blithe: Believe me, noble Lord, if you knew all, You'd change your merry vein to sudden sorrow. HODGE. I change my merry vein? no, thou Bononian, no. I am a Lord--and therefore let me go-- And do defy thee and thy Sasigis; Therefore stand off, and come not near my honor. GOVERNOUR. My Lord, this jesting cannot serve your turn. HODGE. Doost think, thou black Bononian beast, That I do flout, do gibe, or jest, No, no, thou Beer-pot, know that I, A noble Earl, a Lord pardie-- [A Trumpet sounds.] GOVERNOUR. What means this Trumpet's sound? [Enter a Messenger.] CITIZEN. One come from the States of Mantua. GOVERNOUR. What would you with us? speak, thou man of Mantua. MESSENGER. Men of Bononia, this my message is: To let you know the Noble Earl of Bedford Is safe within the town of Mantua, And wills you send the peasant that you have, Who hath deceived your expectation; Or else the States of Mantua have vowed They will recall the truce that they have made, And not a man shall stir from forth your town, That shall return, unless you send him back. GOVERNOUR. O this misfortune, how it mads my heart! The Neopolitan hath beguiled us all. Hence with this fool! what shall we do with him, The Earl being gone? a plague upon it all. HODGE. No, I'll assure you, I am no Earl, but a smith, sir; One Hodge, a smith at Putney, sir; One that hath gulled you, that hath bored you, sir. GOVERNOUR. Away with him! take hence the fool you came for. HODGE. Aye, sir, and I'll leave the greater fool with you. MESSENGER. Farewell, Bononians.  Come, friend, a long with me. HODGE. My friend, afore; my Lordship will follow thee. [Exit.] GOVERNOUR. Well, Mantua, since by thee the Earl is lost, Within few days I hope to see thee crossed. [Exit omnes.] [Enter Chorus.] CHORUS. Thus far you see how Cromwell's fortune passed. The Earl of Bedford, being safe in Mantua, Desires Cromwell's company into France, To make requital for his courtesy: But Cromwell doth deny the Earl his suit, And tells him that those parts he meant to see, he had not yet set footing on the land, And so directly takes his way to Spain: The Earl to France, and so they both do part. Now let your thoughts, as swift as is the wind, Skip some few years, that Cromwell spent in travel, And now imagine him to be in England, Servant unto the master of the Rules, Where in short time he there began to flourish. An hour shall show you what few years did cherish. [Exit.] ACT III. SCENE III. London. A room in Sir Christopher Hales's house. [The Music plays, they bring out the banquet.  Enter Sir Christopher Hales, and Cromwell, and two servants.] HALES. Come, sirs, be careful of your master's credit, And as our bounty now exceeds the figure Of common entertainment:  so do you With looks as free as is your master's soul, Give formal welcome to the thronged tables, That shall receive the Cardinal's followers And the attendants of the Lord Chancellor. But all my care, Cromwell, depends on thee. Thou art a man differing from vulgar form, And by how much thy spirit is ranked bove these In rules of Art, by so much it shines brighter By travel whose observance pleads his merit, In a most learned, yet unaffecting spirit, Good Cromwell, cast an eye of fair regard Bout all my house, and what this ruder flesh, Through ignorance, or wine, do miscreate, Salve thou with courtesy:  if welcome want, Full bowls and ample banquets will seem scant. CROMWELL. Sir, what soever lies in me, Assure you, I will shew my utmost duty. [Exit Cromwell.] HALES. About it, then; the Lords will straight be here.-- Cromwell, thou hast those parts would rather suit The service of the state, than of my house. I look upon thee with a loving eye, That one day will prefer thy destiny. [Enter Messenger.] MESSENGER. Sir, the Lords be at hand. HALES. They are welcome; bid Cromwell straight attend us, And look you all things be in perfect readiness. [The Music plays.  Enter Cardinal Wolsey, Sir Thomas More and Gardiner.] WOLSEY. O, sir Christopher, You are too liberal.  What, a banket to? HALES. My Lords, if words could show the ample welcome, That my free heart affords you, I could then Become a prater, but I now must deal Like a feast Politician with your Lordships; Defer your welcome till the banket end, That it may then salve our defect of fair: Yet Welcome now and all that tend on you. WOLSEY. Thanks to the kind master of the Rules. Come and sit down; sit down, sir Thomas More. Tis strange, how that we and the Spaniard differ. Their dinner is our banquet after dinner, And they are men of active disposition. This I gather:  that by their sparing meat Their body is more fitter for the wars, And if that famine chance to pinch their maws, Being used to fast it breeds less pain. HALES. Fill me some Wine:  I'll answer Cardinal Wolsey. My Lord, we English are of more freer souls Than hungerstarved and ill complexioned spaniards. They that are rich in Spain spare belly food, To deck their backs with an Italian hood, And Silks of Civil:  And the poorest Snake, That feeds on Lemons, Pilchers, and near heated His pallet with sweet flesh, will bear a case More fat and gallant than his starved face. Pride, the Inquisition, and this belly evil, Are, in my judgement, Spain's three headed devil. MORE. Indeed it is a plague unto their nation, Who stagger after in blind imitation. HALES. My Lords, with welcome, I present your Lordships A solemn health. MORE. I love health well, but when as healths do bring Pain to the head and bodies sufeiting, Then cease I healths.-- Nay, spill not, friend, for though the drops be small, Yet have they force, to force men to the wall. WOLSEY. Sir Christopher, is that your man? HALES. And like your grace; he is a Scholar and A Lingest, one that hath travelled many parts Of Christendom, my Lord. WOLSEY. My friend, come nearer; have you been a traveller? CROMWELL. My Lord, I have added to my knowledge the low Countries, France, Spain, Germany, and Italy: And though small gain of profit I did find, Yet did it please my eye, content my mind. WOLSEY. What do you think of the several states And princes' Courts as you have travelled? CROMWELL. My Lord, no Court with England may compare, Neither for state nor civil government: Lust dwells in France, in Italy, and Spain, From the poor peasant to the Prince's train, In Germany and Holland riot serves, And he that most can drink, most he deserves: England I praise not, for I here was borne, But that she laugheth the others unto scorn. WOLSEY. My Lord, there dwells within that spirit More than can be discerned by outward eye. Sir Christopher, will you part with your man? HALES. I have sought to profer him to your Lordship, And now I see he hath prefered himself. WOLSEY. What is thy name? CROMWELL. Cromwell, my Lord. WOLSEY. Then, Cromwell, here we make thee Solicitor of our causes, and nearest next our self.  Gardiner give you kind welcome to the man. [Gardiner embraces him.] MORE. My Lord, you are a royal Winer, Have got a man besides your bounteous dinner. Well, Knight, pray we come no more: If we come often, thou maist shut thy door. WOLSEY. Sir Christopher, hadst thou given me half thy lands, Thou couldest not have pleased me so much as with This man of thine.  My infant thoughts do spell: Shortly his fortune shall be lifted higher; True industry doth kindle honour's fire. And so, kind master of the Rules, farewell. HALES. Cromwell, farewell. CROMWELL. Cromwell takes his leave of you, That near will leave to love and honour you. [Exit omnes.  The Music plays, as they go in.] ACT IV. [Enter Chorus.] CHORUS. Now Cromwell's highest fortunes doth begin. Wolsey, that loved him as he did his life, Committed all his treasure to his hands. Wolsey is dead, and Gardiner, his man, Is now created Bishop of Winchester: Pardon if we omit all Wolsey's life, Because our play depends on Cromwell's death. Now sit and see his highest state of all; His haight of rising and his sudden fall. Pardon the errors is all ready past, And live in hope the best doth come at last: My hope upon your favour doth depend, And look to have your liking ere the end. [Exit.] ACT IV. SCENE I. The same. A public walk. [Enter Gardiner Bishop of Winchester, The Dukes of Norfolk, and of Suffolk, Sir Thomas More, Sir Christopher Hales, and Cromwell.] NORFOLK. Master Cromwell, since Cardinal Wolsey's death, His majesty is given to understand There's certain bills and writings in your hand, That much concerns the state of England. My Lord of Winchester, is it not so? GARDINER. My Lord of Norfolk, we two wear whilom fellows; And, master Cromwell, though our master's love Did bind us, while his love was to the King, It is not boot now to deny these things, Which may be prejudicial to the state: And though that God hath raised my fortune higher Than any way I looked for or deserved, Yet my life no longer with me dwell, Than I prove true unto my Sovereign: What say you, master Cromwell? have you those    writings? Aye, or no? CROMWELL. Here are the writings, and upon my knees, I give them up unto the worthy Dukes Of Suffolk and of Norfolk:  he was my Master, And each virtuous part, That lived in him, I tendered with my heart; But what his head complotted gainst the state My country's love commands me that to hate. His sudden death I grieve for, not his fall, Because he sought to work my country's thrall. SUFFOLK. Cromwell, the King shall hear of this thy duty, Whom I assure my self will well reward thee; My Lord let's go unto his Majesty, And show these writings which he longs to see. [Exit Norfolk and Suffolk.] [Enter Bedford hastily.] BEDFORD. How now, who's this? Cromwell, by my soul! welcome to England: Thou once didst save my life, didst not Cromwell? CROMWELL. If I did so, 'tis greater glory for me, That you remember it, than of my self Vainly to report it. BEDFORD. Well, Cromwell, now is the time, I shall commend thee to my Sovereign: Cheer up thy self, for I will raise thy state. A Russell yet was never found ingrate. [Exit.] HALES. O how uncertain is the wheel of state. Who lately greater than the Cardinal, For fear, and love? and now who lower lies? Gay honours are but Fortune's flatteries, And whom this day pride and promotion swells, To morrow envy and ambition quells. MORE. Who sees the Cob-web intangle the poor Fly, May boldly say the wretches death is nigh. GARDINER. I knew his state and proud ambition Was too too violent to last over-long. HALES. Who soars too near the sun with golden wings, Melts them, to ruin his own fortune brings. [Enter the Duke of Suffolk.] SUFFOLK. Cromwell, kneel down in King Henry's name.-- Arise sir Thomas Cromwell; thus begins thy fame. [Enter the Duke of Norfolk.] NORFOLK. Cromwell, the majesty of England, For the good liking he conceives of thee, Makes thee master of the jewel house, Chief Secretary to himself, and with all, Creates thee one of his highness' privy Counsel. [Enter the Earl of Bedford.] BEDFORD. Where is sir Thomas Cromwell? is he knighted? SUFFOLK. He is, my Lord. BEDFORD. Then to add honour to his name, The King creates him Lord keeper of His privy Seal, and master of the Rules, Which you sir Christopher do now enjoy; The King determines higher place for you. CROMWELL. My Lords, These honors are too high for my desert. MORE. O content thee, man; who would not choose it? Yet thou art wise in seeming to refuse it. GARDINER. Here's honors, titles, and promotions: I fear this climbing will have a sudden fall. NORFOLK. Then come, my Lords; let's altogether bring This new made Counselor to England's King. [Exit all but Gardiner.] GARDINER. But Gardiner means his glory shall be dimmed. Shall Cromwell live a greater man than I? My envy with his honour now is bred; I hope to shorten Cromwell by the head. [Exit.] ACT IV. SCENE II. London. A street before Cromwell's house. [Enter Friskiball very poor.] FRISKIBALL. O Friskiball, what shall become of thee? Where shalt thou go, or which way shalt thou turn Fortune, that turns her too unconstant wheel, Hath turned thy wealth and riches in the Sea. All parts abroad where ever I have been Grows weary of me, and denies me succour; My debtors, they that should relieve my want, Forswears my money, says they owe me none: They know my state too mean to bear out law, And here in London, where I oft have been, And have done good to many a wretched man, I am now most wretched here, despised my self. In vain it is, more of their hearts to try; Be patient, therefore, lay thee down and die. [He lies down.] [Enter good man Seely, and his wife Joan.] SEELY. Come, Joan, come; let's see what he'll do for us now.  Iwis we have done for him, when many a time and often he might have gone a hungry to bed. WIFE. Alas, man, now he is made a Lord, he'll never look upon us; he'll fulfill the old Proverb:  Set beggars a horse-back, and they'll ride.--A, welliday for my Cow! such as he hath made us come behind hand:  we had never pawned our Cow else to pay our rent. SEELY. Well, Joan, he'll come this way:  and by God's dickers, I'll tell him roundly of it, and if he were ten Lords:  a shall know that I had not my Cheese and my Bacon for nothing. WIFE. Do you remember, husband, how he would mooch up my Cheese cakes? he hath forgot this now, but we'll remember him. SEELY. Aye, we shall have now three flaps with a Fox tail; but, I faith, I'll gibber a joint, but I'll tell him his own.  Stay, who comes here?  O stand up; here he comes; stand up. [Enter Hodge very fine with a Tipstaff; Cromwell, the Mace carried before him; Norfolk, and Suffolk, and attendants.] HODGE. Come, away with these beggars here; rise up, sirra. Come, out the good people:  run afore there, ho! [Friskiball riseth, and stands a far off.] SEELY. Aye, we are kicked away, now we come for our own; the time hath been he would a looked more friendly upon us.  And you, Hodge, we know you well enough, though you are so fine. CROMWELL. Come hither, sirrah.--Stay, what men are these? My honest Host of Hounslow and his wife! I owe thee money, father, do I not? SEELY. Aye, by the body of me, dooest thou.  Would thou wouldest pay me:  good four pound it is, I have a the post at home. CROMWELL. I know tis true.  Sirra, give him ten Angels: And look your wife and you do stay to dinner: And while you live, I freely give to you Four pound a year, for the four pound I ought you. SEELY. Art not changed, art old Tom still!  Now God bless the good Lord Tom.  Home, Joan, home; I'll dine with my Lord Tom to day, and thou shalt come next week.  Fetch my Cow; home, Joan, home. WIFE. Now God bless thee, my good Lord Tom; I'll fetch my cow presently. [Exit Wife.] [Enter Gardiner.] CROMWELL. Sirra, go to yon stranger; tell him I Desire him stay at dinner.  I must speak With him. GARDINER. My Lord of Norfolk, see you this same bubble, That same puff? but mark the end, my Lord, Mark the end. NORFOLK. I promise you, I like not something he hath done, But let that pass; the King doth love him well. CROMWELL. God morrow to my Lord of Winchester. I know you bear me hard about the Abbey lands. GARDINER. Have I not reason, when religion is wronged? You had no colour for what you have done. CROMWELL. Yes; the abolishing of Antichrist, And of this Popish order from our Realm. I am no enemy to religion, But what is done, it is for England's good. What did they serve for but to feed a sort Of lazy Abbots and of full fed Friars? They neither plow, nor sow, and yet they reap The fat of all the Land, and suck the poor: Look, what was theirs, is in King Henry's hands; His wealth before lay in the Abbey lands. GARDINER. Indeed these things you have alleged, my Lord, When God doth know the infant yet unborn Will curse the time the Abbeys were pulled down. I pray, now where is hospitality? Where now may poor distressed people go, For to relieve their need, or rest their bones, When weary travel doth oppress their limbs? And where religious men should take them in, Shall now be kept back with a Mastiff do, And thousand thousand-- NORFOLK. O, my Lord, no more:  things past redress Tis bootless to complain. CROMWELL. What, shall we to the Convocation house? NORFOLK. We'll follow you, my Lord; pray, lead the way. [Enter Old Cromwell like a Farmer.] OLD CROMWELL. How? one Cromwell made Lord Keeper since I    left Putney And dwelt in Yorkshire.  I never heard better news: I'll see that Cromwell, or it shall go hard. CROMWELL. My aged father! state set aside, Father, on my knee I crave your blessing: One of my servants go and have him in; At better leisure will we talk with him. OLD CROMWELL. Now if I die, how happy were the day! To see this comfort rains forth showers of joy. [Exit Old Cromwell.] NORFOLK. This duty in him shows a kind of grace. CROMWELL. Go on before, for time draws on apace. [Exit all buy Friskiball.] FRISKIBALL. I wonder what this Lord would have with me. His man so strictly gave me charge to stay: I never did offend him to my knowledge. Well, good or bad, I mean to bide it all; Worse than I am now never can befall. [Enter Banister and his wife.] BANISTER. Come, wife, I take it be almost dinner time, For master Newton, and master Crosby sent To me last night, they would come dine with me, And take their bond in:  I pray thee, hie thee home, And see that all things be in readiness. MISTRESS BANISTER. They shall be welcome, husband; I'll go before.-- But is not that man master Friskiball? [She runs and embraces him.] BANISTER. O heavens, it is kind master Friskiball! Say sir, what hap hath brought you to this pass? FRISKIBALL. The same that brought you to your misery. BANISTER. Why would you not acquaint me with your state? Is Banister your poor friend quite forgot: Whose goods, whose love, whose life and all is yours? FRISKIBALL. I thought your usage would be as the rest, That had more kindness at my hands than you, Yet looked askance, when as they saw me poor. MISTRESS BANISTER. If Banister should bear so base a heart, I never would look my husband in the face, But hate him as I would a Cockatrise. BANISTER. And well thou mightest, should Banister deal so. Since that I saw you, sir, my state is mended: And for the thousand pound I owe to you, I have it ready for you, sir, at home; And though I grieve your fortune is so bad, Yet that my hap's to help you make me glad. And now, sir, will it please you walk with me? FRISKIBALL. Not yet I cannot, for the Lord Chancellor Hath here commanded me to wait on him, For what I know not:  pray God tis for my good. BANISTER. never make doubt of that; I'll warrant you, He is as kind a noble gentleman As ever did possess the place he hath. MISTRESS BANISTER. Sir, my brother is his steward; if you please, We'll go along and bear you company: I know we shall not want for welcome there. FRISKIBALL. With all my heart:  but what's become of Bagot? BANISTER. He is hanged, for buying jewels of the King's. FRISKIBALL. A just reward for one so impious. The time draws on, sir; will you go along? BANISTER. I'll follow you, kind master Friskiball. [Exit Omnes.] ACT IV. SCENE III. The same. Another street. [Enter two Merchants.] FIRST MERCHANT. Now, master Crosby, I see you have a care, To keep your word, in payment of your money. SECOND MERCHANT. By my faith, I have reason upon a bond; Three thousand pound is too much to forfeit. Yet I doubt not Master Banister. FIRST MERCHANT. By my faith, your sum is more than mine, And yet i am not much behind you too, Considering that to day I paid at court. SECOND MERCHANT. Mass, and well remembered, What's the reason the Lord Cromwell's men Wear such long skirts upon their coats. They reach almost down to their very ham. FIRST MERCHANT. I will resolve you, sir; and thus it is: The Bishop of Winchester, that loves not Cromwell, As great men are envied, as well as less-- A while ago there was a jar between them, And it was brought to my Lord Cromwell's ear, That Bishop Gardiner would sit on his skirt; Upon which word, he made his men long Blue coats, And in the Court wore one of them himself: And meeting with the Bishop, quoth he, 'My Lord, Here's skirt enough now for your Grace to sit on;' Which vexed the Bishop to the very heart. This is the reason why they wear long coats. SECOND MERCHANT. Tis always seen, and mark it for a rule, That one great man will envy still another: But tis a thing that nothing concerns me. What, shall we now to Master Banister's? FIRST MERCHANT. Aye, come, we'll pay him royally for our dinner. [Exit.] ACT IV. SCENE IV. The same. A room in Cromwell's house. [Enter the Usher and the Shewer, the meat goes over the stage.] USHER. Uncover there, Gentlemen. [Enter Cromwell, Bedford, Suffolk, Old Cromwell, Friskiball, goodman Seely, and attendants.] CROMWELL. My noble Lords of Suffolk and of Bedford, Your honors' welcome to poor Cromwell's house. Where is my father? nay, be covered, Father. Although that duty to these noble men Doth challenge it, yet I'll make bold with them. Your head doth bear the calendar of care. What, Cromwell covered and his Father bare! It must not be.  Now, sir, to you.  Is not Your name Friskiball and a Florentine? FRISKIBALL. My name was Friskiball, till cruel fate Did rob me of my name and of my state. CROMWELL. What fortune brought you to this country now? FRISKIBALL. All other parts hath left me succourless, Save only this.  Because of debts I have, I hope to gain for to relieve my want. CROMWELL. Did you not once, upon your Florence bridge, Help two distressed men, robbed by the Bandetti?-- His name was Cromwell. FRISKIBALL. I never made my brain a calendar Of any good I did; I always loved this nation with my heart. CROMWELL. I am that Cromwell that you there relieved. Sixteen Ducats you gave me for to clothe me, Sixteen to bear my charges by the way, And sixteen more I had for my horse hire: There be those several sums justly returned, Yet with injustice, serving at my need, And to repay them without interest. Therefore receive of me these four several bags; In each of them there is four hundred mark; And bring me the names of all your debitors, And if they will not see you paid, I will: O God forbid, that I should see him fall, That helped me in my greatest need of all. Here stands my Father that first gave me life, Alas, what duty is too much for him? This man in time of need did save my life, And therefore I cannot do too much for him. By this old man I often times was fed, Else might I have gone supperless to bed. Such kindness have I had of these three men, That Cromwell no way can repay again. Now in to dinner, for we stay too long, And to good stomachs is no greater wrong. [Exit omnes.] ACT IV. SCENE V. The same. A room in the Bishop of Winchester's house. [Enter Gardiner in his study, and his man.] GARDINER. Sirra, where be those men I caused to stay? SERVANT. They do attend your pleasure, sir, within. GARDINER. Bid them come hither, and stay you without:-- For by those men, the Fox of this same land, That makes a Goose of better than himself, We'll worry him unto his latest home, Or Gardiner will fail in his intent. As for the Dukes of Suffolk and Norfolk, Whom I have sent for to come speak with me, Howsoever, outwardly they shadow it, Yet in their hearts I know they love him not: As for the Earl of Bedford, he is but one, And dares not gainsay what we do set down. [Enter the two witnesses.] Now, my friends, you know I saved your lives, When by the law you had deserved death, And then you promised me upon your oaths, To venture both your lives to do me good. BOTH WITNESSES. We swore no more than that we will perform. GARDINER. I take your words; and that which you must do Is service for your God, and for your King: To root a rebel from this flourishing land, One that's an enemy unto the Church: And therefore must you take your solemn oaths, That you heard Cromwell, the Lord Chancellor, Did wish a dagger at King Henry's heart. Fear not to swear it, for I heard him speak it; Therefore we'll shield you from ensuing harms. SECOND WITNESS. If you will warrant us the deed is good, We'll undertake it. GARDINER. Kneel down, and I will here absolve you both. This Crucifix I lay upon your head, And sprinkle holy-water on your brows. The deed is meritorious that you do, And by it shall you purchase grace from heaven. FIRST WITNESS. Now, sir, we'll undertake it, by our souls. SECOND WITNESS. For Cromwell never loved none of our sort. GARDINER. I know he doth not, and for both of you, I will prefer you to some place of worth: Now get you in, until I call for you, For presently the Dukes means to be here. [Exit witnesses.] Cromwell, sit fast, thy time's not long to reign. The Abbeys that were pulled down by thy means Is now a mean for me to pull thee down: Thy pride also thy own head lights upon, For thou art he hath changed religion:-- But now no more, for here the Dukes are come. [Enter Suffolk, Norfolk, and the Earl of Bedford.] SUFFOLK. Goodden to my Lord Bishop. NORFOLK. How fares my Lord? what, are you all alone? GARDINER. No, not alone, my Lords; my mind is troubled; I know your honours muse wherefore I sent, And in such haste.  What, came you from the King? NORFOLK. We did, and left none but Lord Cromwell with him. GARDINER. O, what a dangerous time is this we live in! There's Thomas Wolsey, he's already gone, And Thomas More, he followed after him: Another Thomas yet there doth remain, That is far worse than either of those twain, And if with speed, my Lords, we not pursue it, I fear the King and all the land will rue it. BEDFORD. Another Thomas! pray God it be not Cromwell. GARDINER. My Lord of Bedford, it is that traitor Cromwell. BEDFORD. Is Cromwell false? my heart will never think it. SUFFOLK. My Lord of Winchester, what likelihood, Or proof have you of this his treachery? GARDINER. My Lord, too much.--Call in the men within. [Enter witnesses.] These men, my Lord, upon their oaths affirm, That they did hear Lord Cromwell in his garden, Wished a dagger sticking at the heart Of our King Henry.  What is this but treason? BEDFORD. If it be so, my heart doth bleed with sorrow. SUFFOLK. How say you friends? what, did you hear these words? FIRST WITNESS. We did, and like your grace. NORFOLK. In what place was Lord Cromwell when he spake them? SECOND WITNESS. In his Garden, where we did attend a suit, Which we had waited for two year and more. SUFFOLK. How long ist since you heard him speak these words? SECOND WITNESS. Some half year since. BEDFORD. How chance that you concealed it all this time? FIRST WITNESS. His greatness made us fear, that was the cause. GARDINER. Aye, aye, his greatness; that's the cause indeed; And to make his treason here more manifest, He calls his servants to him round about, Tells them of Wolsey's life, and of his fall, Says that himself hath many enemies, And gives to some of them a Park or Manor, To others Leases, Lands to other some: What need he do thus in his prime of life, And if he were not fearful of his death? SUFFOLK. My Lord, these likelihoods are very great. BEDFORD. Pardon me, Lords, for I must needs depart; Their proofs are great, but greater is my heart. [Exit Bedford.] NORFOLK. My friends, take heed of that which you have said. Your souls must answer what your tongues reports: Therefore, take heed, be wary what you do. SECOND WITNESS. My Lord, we speak no more but truth. NORFOLK. Let them Depart.--My Lord of Winchester, let these men Be close kept until the day of trial. GARDINER. They shall, my Lord:  ho, take in these two men. [Exit witnesses.] My Lords, if Cromwell have a public trial, That which we do is void by his denial; You know the king will credit none but him. NORFOLK. Tis true, he rules the King even as he pleases. SUFFOLK. How shall we do for to attach him, then? GARDINER. Marry, my Lords, thus:  by an Act he made himself, With an intent to entrap some of our lives, And this it is:  If any Counsellor Be convicted of high treason, he shall Be executed without a public trial. This Act, my Lords, he caused the King to make. SUFFOLK. A did indeed, and I remember it, And now it is like to fall upon himself. NORFOLK. Let us not slack it, tis for England's good. We must be wary, else he'll go beyond us. GARDINER. Well hath your Grace said, my Lord of Norfolk; Therefore let us presently to Lambeth. Thether comes Cromwell from the Court to night. Let us arrest him, send him to the Tower, And in the morning, cut off the traitor's head. NORFOLK. Come, then, about it, let us guard the town. This is the day that Cromwell must go down. GARDINER. Along, my Lords.--Well, Cromwell is half dead; He shaked my heart, but I will shave his head. [Exeunt.] ACT V. SCENE I.  A street in London. [Enter Bedford solus.] BEDFORD. My soul is like a water troubled, And Gardiner is the man that makes it so. O, Cromwell, I do fear they end is near: Yet I'll prevent their malice if I can. And in good time, see where the man doth come, Who little knows how nears his day of doom. [Enter Cromwell with his train.  Bedford makes as though he would speak to him:  he goes on.] CROMWELL. You're well encountered, my good Lord of Bedford. I see your honour is addressed to talk; Pray pardon me, I am sent for to the king, And do not know the business yet my self. So fare you well, for I must needs be gone. [Exit all the train.] BEDFORD. You must; well, what remedy? I fear too soon you must be gone indeed. The king hath business, but little doest thou know, Whose busy for thy life:  thou thinks not so. [Enter Cromwell and the train again.] CROMWELL. The second time well met, my Lord of Bedford; I am very sorry that my haste is such. Lord Marquess Dorset being sick to death, I must receive of him the privy seal. At Lambeth, soon, my Lord, we'll talk our fill. [Exit the train.] BEDFORD. How smooth and easy is the way to death! [Enter a servant.] MESSENGER. My Lord, the dukes of Norfolk and of Suffolk, Accompanied with the Bishop of Winchester, Entreats you to come presently to Lambeth, On earnest matters that concerns the state. BEDFORD. To Lambeth! so:  go fetch me pen and ink. I and Lord Cromwell there shall talk enough; Aye, and our last, I fear, and if he come. [He writes a letter.] Here, take this letter, and bear it to Lord Cromwell. Bid him read it; say it concerns him near: Away, begone, make all the haste you can. To Lambeth do I go a woeful man. [Exit.] ACT V. SCENE II. A street near the Thames. [Enter Cromwell and his train.] CROMWELL. Is the Barge ready?  I will straight to Lambeth, And if this one day's business once were past, I'd take my ease to morrow after trouble.-- How now, my friend, wouldst thou speak with me? [The Messenger brings him the letter; he puts it in his pocket.] MESSENGER. Sir, here's a letter from my Lord of Bedford. CROMWELL. O good, my friend, commend me to thy Lord. Hold, take those Angels; drink them for thy pains. MESSENGER. He doth desire your grace to read it, Because he says it doth concern you near. CROMWELL. Bid him assure himself of that.  Farewell. To morrow, tell him, shall he hear from me.-- Set on before there, and away to Lambeth. [Exeunt omnes.] ACT V. SCENE III. Lambeth. [Enter Winchester, Suffolk, Norfolk, Bedford, Sargeant at arms, the Herald, and halberts.] GARDINER. Halberts, stand close unto the waterside; Sargeant at arms, be bold in your office; Herald, deliver your proclamation. HERALD. This is to give notice to all the king's subjects: The late Lord Cromwell, Lord Chancellor of England, Vicar general over the realm, him to hold and esteem as a traitor against the Crown and dignity of England:  So God save the king. GARDINER. Amen. BEDFORD. Amen,--and root thee from the land, For whilst thou livest truth cannot stand. NORFOLK. Make a lane there, the traitor's at hand. Keep back Cromwell's men; Drown them if they come on.--Sargeant, your office. [Enter Cromwell, they make a lane with their halberts.] CROMWELL. What means my Lord of Norfolk by these words? Sirs, come along. GARDINER. Kill them, if they come on. SARGEANT. Lord Cromwell, in king Henry's name, I do arrest your honour of high treason. CROMWELL. Sargeant, me of treason? [Cromwell's men offer to draw.] SUFFOLK. Kill them, if they draw a sword. CROMWELL. Hold; I charge you, as you love me, draw not a sword. Who dares accuse Cromwell of treason now? GARDINER. This is no place to reckon up your crime; Your Dove-like looks were viewed with serpent's eyes. CROMWELL. With serpent's eyes, indeed, by thine they were; But Gardiner do thy worst, I fear thee not. My faith, compared with thine, as much shall pass, As doth the Diamond excel the glass. Attached of treason, no accusers by! Indeed, what tongue dares speak so foul a lie? NORFOLK. My Lord, my Lord, matters are too well known, And it is time the king had note thereof. CROMWELL. The king! let me go to him face to face; No better trial I desire than that: Let him but say that Cromwell's faith was feigned, Then let my honour and my name be stained. If ever my heart against my king was set, O let my soul in Judgement answer it: Then, if my faith's confirmed with his reason, Gainst whom hath Cromwell, then, committed treason? SUFFOLK. My Lord, your matter shall be tried; Mean time, with patience content your self. CROMWELL. Perforce I must with patience be content. O dear friend Bedford, doest thou stand so near? Cromwell rejoiceth one friend sheds a tear. And whether ist? which way must Cromwell now? GARDINER. My Lord, you must unto the tower.  Lieutenant, Take him to your charge. CROMWELL. Well, where you please; yet before I part, Let me confer a little with my men. GARDINER. As you go by water, so you shall. CROMWELL. I have some business present to impart. NORFOLK. You may not stay.  Lieutenant, take your charge. CROMWELL. Well, well, my Lord, you second Gardiner's text. Norfolk, farewell; thy turn will be the next. [Exit Cromwell and the Lieutenant.] GARDINER. His guilty conscience makes him rave, my Lord. NORFOLK. Aye, let him talk; his time is short enough. GARDINER. My Lord of Bedford, come; you weep for him, That would not shed half a tear for you. BEDFORD. It grieves me for to see his sudden fall. GARDINER. Such success wish I to traitors still. [Exeunt.] ACT V. SCENE IV. London. A street. [Enter two Citizens.] FIRST CITIZEN. Why, can this news be true? ist possible? The great Lord Cromwell arrested upon treason! I hardly will believe it can be so. SECOND CITIZEN. It is too true, sir; would it were otherwise, Condition I spent half the wealth I had. I was at Lambeth, saw him there arrested, And afterward committed to the Tower. FIRST CITIZEN. What, wast for treason that he was committed? SECOND CITIZEN. Kind, noble Gentleman!  I may rue the time. All that I have, I did enjoy by him, And if he die, then all my state is gone. FIRST CITIZEN. It may be doubted that he shall not die, Because the King did favour him so much. SECOND CITIZEN. O sir, you are deceived in thinking so. The grace and favour he had with the king Hath caused him have so many enemies: He that in court secure will keep himself, Must not be great, for then he is envied at. The Shrub is safe, when as the Cedar shakes; For where the King doth love above compare, Of others they as much more envied are. FIRST CITIZEN. Tis pity that this noble man should fall, He did so many charitable deeds. SECOND CITIZEN. Tis true, and yet you see in each estate, There's none so good, but some one doth him hate. And they before would smile him in the face, Will be the formost to do him disgrace: What, will you go along unto the Court? FIRST CITIZEN. I care not if I do, and hear the news, How men will judge what shall become of him. SECOND CITIZEN. Some will speak hardly, some will speak in pity. Go you to the Court, I'll unto the City; There I am sure to hear more news than you. FIRST CITIZEN. Why, then, soon will we meet again. [Exit.] ACT V. SCENE V. A room in the Tower. [Enter Cromwell in the Tower.] CROMWELL. Now, Cromwell, hast thou time to meditate, And think upon thy state, and of the time. Thy honours came unsought, aye, and unlooked for; Thy fall as sudden, and unlooked for too. What glory was in England that I had not? Who in this land commanded more than Cromwell? Except the King who greater than my self? But now I see, what after ages shall: The greater men, more sudden is their fall. And now do I remember the Earl of Bedford Was very desirous for to speak to me, And afterward sent to me a letter, The which I think I have still in my pocket. Now may I read it, for I now have leisure, And this I take it is.  [He reads the Letter.] My Lord, come not this night to Lambeth, For if you do, your state is overthrown. And much I doubt your life, and if you come; Then if you love your self, stay where you are, O God! had I but read this letter, Then had I been free from the Lion's paw; Deferring this to read until to morrow, I spurned at joy, and did embrace my sorrow. [Enter the Lieutenant of the Tower and officers.] Now, master Lieutenant, when's this day of death? LIEUTENANT. Alas, my Lord, would I might never see it. Here are the Dukes of Suffolk and of Norfolk, Winchester, Bedford, and sir Richard Ratcliffe, With others, but why they come I know not. CROMWELL. No matter wherefore, Cromwell is prepared; For Gardiner has my state and life ensnared. Bid them come in, or you shall do them wrong, For here stands he, whom some thinks lives too long. Learning kills learning, and instead of Ink To dip his Pen, Cromwell's heart blood doth drink. [Enter all the Nobles.] NORFOLK. Good morrow, Cromwell.  What, alone, so sad? CROMWELL. One good among you, none of you are bad.-- For my part, it best fits me be alone; Sadness with me, not I with any one. What, is the king acquainted with my cause? NORFOLK. We have, and he hath answered us, my Lord. CROMWELL. How, shall I come to speak with him my self? GARDINER. The King is so advertised of your guilt, he will by no means admit you to his presence. CROMWELL. No way admit me? am I so soon forgot? Did he but yesterday embrace my neck, And said that Cromwell was even half himself, And is his Princely ears so much bewitched With scandalous ignomy, and slanderous speeches, That now he dooth deny to look on me? Well, my Lord of Winchester, no doubt but you Are much in favour with his Majesty: Will you bear a letter from me to his grace? GARDINER. Pardon me, I'll bear no traitor's letters. CROMWELL. Ha!  Will you do this kindness then?  Tell him By word of mouth, what I shall say to you? GARDINER. That will I. CROMWELL. But, on your honour, will you? GARDINER. Aye, on my honor. CROMWELL. Bear witness, Lords.--Tell him when he hath known you, And tried your faith but half so much as mine, He'll find you to be the falsest hearted man In England.  Pray, tell him this. BEDFORD. Be patient, good my Lord, in these extremes. CROMWELL. My kind and honorable Lord of Bedford, I know your honor always loved me well; But, pardon me, this still shall be my theme; Gardiner is the cause makes Cromwell so extreme. Sir Ralph Sadler, pray, a word with you: You were my man, and all that you possess Came by my means; to requite all this, Will you take this letter here of me, And give it with your own hands to the king? SADLER. I kiss your hand, and never will I rest, Ere to the king this will be delivered. [Exit Sadler.] CROMWELL. Why yet Cromwell hath one friend in store. GARDINER. But all the haste he makes shall be but vain.-- Here's a discharge for your prisoner, To see him executed presently.-- My Lord, you hear the tenor of your life. CROMWELL. I do embrace it, welcome my last date, And of this glistering world I take last leave: And, noble Lords, I take my leave of you.-- As willingly I go to meet with death, As Gardiner did pronounce it with his breath: From treason is my heart as white as snow, My death only procured by my foe. I pray, commend me to my Sovereign king, And tell him in what sort his Cromwell died, To lose his head before his cause were tried: But let his Grace, when he shall hear my name, Say only this:  Gardiner procured the same. [Enter young Cromwell.] LIEUTENANT. Here is your son, come to take his leave. CROMWELL. To take his leave!  Come hither, Harry Cromwell. Mark, boy, the last words that I speak to thee. Flatter not Fortune, neither fawn upon her; Gape not for state, yet lose no spark of honor; Ambition, like the plague see thou eschew it; I die for treason, boy, and never knew it. Yet let thy faith as spotless be as mine, And Cromwell's virtues in thy face shall shine. Come, go along and see me leave my breath, And I'll leave thee upon the flower of death. SON. O, father, I shall die to see that wound; Your blood being spilt will make my heart to sound. CROMWELL. How, boy, not look upon the Axe! How shall I do then to have my head stroke off? Come on, my child, and see the end of all, And after say that Gardiner was my fall. GARDINER. My Lord, you speak it of an envious heart; I have done no more than law and equity. BEDFORD. O, good my Lord of Winchester, forbear; It would a better seemed you to been absent, Than with your words disturb a dying man. CROMWELL. Who me, my Lord? no, he disturbs not me. My mind he stirs not, though his mighty shock Hath brought mo' peers' heads down to the block. Farewell, my boy! all Cromwell can bequeath, My hearty blessing; so I take my leave. HANGMAN. I am your death's man; pray, my Lord, forgive me. CROMWELL. Even with my soul.  Why, man, thou art my Doctor, And brings me precious Physic for my soul.-- My Lord of Bedford, I desire of you, Before my death, a corporal embrace. [Bedford comes to him, Cromwell embraces him.] Farewell, great Lord; my love I do commend, My heart to you; my soul to heaven I send. This is my joy that, ere my body fleet, Your honoured arms is my true winding sheet. Farewell, dear Bedford; my peace is made in heaven. Thus falls great Cromwell a poor ell in length, To rise to unmeasured height, winged with new strength, The land of Worms, which dying men discover, My soul is shrined with heaven's celestial cover. [Exit Cromwell and the officers, and others.] BEDFORD. Well, farewell, Cromwell, the truest friend, That ever Bedford shall possess again.-- Well, Lords, I fear, when this man is dead, You'll wish in vain that Cromwell had a head. [Enter one with Cromwell's head.] OFFICER. Here is the head of the deceased Cromwell. BEDFORD. Pray thee, go hence, and bear his head away Unto his body; inter them both in clay. [Enter Sir Ralph Sadler.] SADLER. Ho now, my Lords:  what, is Lord Cromwell dead? BEDFORD. Lord Cromwell's body now doth want a head. SADLER. O God! a little speed had saved his life. Here is a kind reprieve come from the king, To bring him straight unto his majesty. SUFFOLK. Aye, aye, sir Ralph, reprieves comes now too late. GARDINER. My conscience now tells me this deed was ill: Would Christ that Cromwell were alive again. NORFOLK. Come, let us to the king, whom well I know, Will grieve for Cromwell, that his death was so. [Exeunt omnes.] FINIS.
Copyright © Timothy E. Clontz 1999  All rights reserved. The Second Letter  of Paul to Timothy 1 	1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according  to the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus, 2 to Timothy, my beloved  son: grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our  Lord.  	3 I thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience the way my  forefathers did, as I constantly remember you in my prayers night and day.  4 As I recall your tears, I long to see you, so that I may be filled with joy.  5 For I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first dwelt in your  grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and I am sure is in you as  well. 6 For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God  which is in you through the laying on of my hands. 7 For God did not  give us a spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power and love and self- discipline. 8 So do not be ashamed to testify of our Lord or of me his  prisoner, but join with me in suffering for the gospel according to the  power of God, 9 who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not  according to our works, but according to his own purpose and the grace  which was granted us in Christ Jesus from all eternity, 10 but has now  been revealed through the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has  abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the  gospel. 11 For this gospel I was appointed a preacher and an apostle and a  teacher. 12 For this reason I also suffer as I do. But I am not ashamed, for  I know whom I have believed and I am convinced that he is able to guard  what I have entrusted to him until that day. 13 Follow the pattern of  sound words which you have heard from me, in the faith and love which  are in Christ Jesus. 14 Guard, through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us,  the treasure that has been entrusted to you.  	15 You are aware of the fact that all who are in Asia turned away  from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes. 16 May the Lord  grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me  and was not ashamed of my chains; 17 but when he was in Rome, he  eagerly searched for me and found me18 may the Lord grant him to find  mercy from the Lord on that Dayand you know very well all the service  he rendered at Ephesus.  2 	1 You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ  Jesus. 2 And the things you have heard from me in the presence of many  witnesses, entrust to faithful men who will be able to teach others also. 3  Share in hardship as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. 4 No soldier in active  service gets entangled in civilian affairs, since his aim is to please the one  who enlisted him as a soldier. 5 Also if anyone competes as an athlete, he  does not win the prize unless he competes according to the rules. 6 The  hard-working farmer ought to be the first to receive his share of the crops.  7 Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in  everything.  	8 Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, descended from  David according to my gospel, 9 for which I am suffering even to the  point of wearing chains like a criminal. But the word of God is not  chained. 10 Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that  they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal  glory. 11 Here is a trustworthy saying:  	if we died with him, we will also live with him;  12	if we endure, we will also reign with him;  	if we deny him, he also will deny us;  13	if we are faithless, he remains faithful,  		for he cannot deny himself.  	14 Remind them of these things, and charge them in the presence  of God to avoid disputing about words, which does no good, but only  ruins the hearers. 15 Do your best to present yourself to God as one  approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed, rightly handling  the word of truth. 16 Avoid godless chatter, for it will lead people into  more and more ungodliness, 17 and their talk will spread like gangrene.  Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, 18 who have gone astray from  the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and upset  the faith of some. 19 Nevertheless, God's firm foundation stands, having  this seal: "The Lord knows those who are his," and, "Everyone who  names the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness." 20 In a  large house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood  and earthenware, and some for noble use, some for ignoble. 21 If anyone  cleanses himself from what is ignoble, he will be a vessel for noble  purposes, made holy, useful to the Master and prepared to do any good  work. 22 Now flee from youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith,  love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.  23 Don't have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because  you know that they produce quarrels. 24 And the Lord's servant must not  be quarrelsome, but he must be kind to everyone, able to teach, patient  when wronged, 25 with gentleness correcting those who are in  opposition, if perhaps God will grant them repentance leading to the  knowledge of the truth, 26 and they may come to their senses and escape  from the snare of the devil, having been held captive by him to do his will.  3 	1 But understand this, that in the last days there will come times  of stress. 2 For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful,  arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, 3  unloving, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, haters of  good, 4 treacherous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than  lovers of God, 5 holding a form of godliness but denying its power. Avoid  such people. 6 For among them are those who make their way into  households and capture weak women, weighed down with sins and  swayed by various impulses, 7 always learning and never able to come to  the knowledge of the truth. 8 Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses,  so these men also oppose the truth, men of depraved mind, rejected in  regard to the faith. 9 But they will not get very far, for their folly will be  plain to all, as was that of those two men.  	10 You, however, know all about my teaching, my conduct, my  purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance, 11 persecutions, and sufferings,  such as happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium and at Lystra; what  persecutions I endured, yet the Lord rescued me from them all. 12 Indeed  all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, 13  while evil men and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving and  being deceived. 14 But as for you, continue in what you have learned and  have become convinced of, knowing from whom you learned it, 15 and  how from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able  to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. 16 All  scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for  correction, and for training in righteousness; 17 so that the man of God  may be complete, equipped for every good work.  4 	1 I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ  Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and  his kingdom: 2 preach the word; be ready in season and out of season;  correct, rebuke, and exhort, with great patience and instruction. 3 For the  time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but having  itching ears, they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their  own desires, 4 and will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside  to myths. 5 But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work  of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.  	6 For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the  time of my departure has come. 7 I have fought the good fight, I have  finished the race, I have kept the faith. 8 In the future there is laid up for  me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will  award to me on that day; and not only to me, but also to all who have  loved his appearing.  	9 Do your best to come to me soon; 10 for Demas, having loved  this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica. Crescens  has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia. 11 Only Luke is with me. Get  Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me in my ministry. 12  But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus. 13 When you come, bring the cloak  that I left with Carpus at Troas, and the books, especially the parchments.  14 Alexander the coppersmith did me great harm; the Lord will repay him  for his deeds. 15 Be on guard against him yourself, for he strongly  opposed our message.  	16 At my first defense no one came to my support, but all  deserted me; may it not be counted against them. 17 But the Lord stood at  my side and gave me strength, so that through me the message might be  fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I was rescued  from the lion's mouth. 18 The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack  and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory for  ever and ever. Amen.  	19 Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.  20 Erastus remained at Corinth, but Trophimus I left sick at Miletus. 21  Do your best to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, and so do  Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brethren. 22 The Lord be with  your spirit. Grace be with you.  Second Timothy, page 1

Enter the King, Lord John of Lancaster, Earl of Westmoreland, [Sir Walter Blunt,] with others.   King. So shaken as we are, so wan with care,     Find we a time for frighted peace to pant     And breathe short-winded accents of new broils     To be commenc'd in stronds afar remote.     No more the thirsty entrance of this soil     Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood.     No more shall trenching war channel her fields,     Nor Bruise her flow'rets with the armed hoofs     Of hostile paces. Those opposed eyes     Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,     All of one nature, of one substance bred,     Did lately meet in the intestine shock     And furious close of civil butchery,     Shall now in mutual well-beseeming ranks     March all one way and be no more oppos'd     Against acquaintance, kindred, and allies.     The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,     No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,     As far as to the sepulchre of Christ-     Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross     We are impressed and engag'd to fight-     Forthwith a power of English shall we levy,     Whose arms were moulded in their mother's womb     To chase these pagans in those holy fields     Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet     Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd     For our advantage on the bitter cross.     But this our purpose now is twelvemonth old,     And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go.     Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear     Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,     What yesternight our Council did decree     In forwarding this dear expedience.   West. My liege, this haste was hot in question     And many limits of the charge set down     But yesternight; when all athwart there came     A post from Wales, loaden with heavy news;     Whose worst was that the noble Mortimer,     Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight     Against the irregular and wild Glendower,     Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,     A thousand of his people butchered;     Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,     Such beastly shameless transformation,     By those Welshwomen done as may not be     Without much shame retold or spoken of.   King. It seems then that the tidings of this broil     Brake off our business for the Holy Land.   West. This, match'd with other, did, my gracious lord;     For more uneven and unwelcome news     Came from the North, and thus it did import:     On Holy-rood Day the gallant Hotspur there,     Young Harry Percy, and brave Archibald,     That ever-valiant and approved Scot,     At Holmedon met,     Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour;     As by discharge of their artillery     And shape of likelihood the news was told;     For he that brought them, in the very heat     And pride of their contention did take horse,     Uncertain of the issue any way.   King. Here is a dear, a true-industrious friend,     Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse,     Stain'd with the variation of each soil     Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours,     And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.     The Earl of Douglas is discomfited;     Ten thousand bold Scots, two-and-twenty knights,     Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see     On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took     Mordake Earl of Fife and eldest son     To beaten Douglas, and the Earl of Athol,     Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith.     And is not this an honourable spoil?     A gallant prize? Ha, cousin, is it not?   West. In faith,     It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.   King. Yea, there thou mak'st me sad, and mak'st me sin     In envy that my Lord Northumberland     Should be the father to so blest a son-     A son who is the theme of honour's tongue,     Amongst a grove the very straightest plant;     Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride;     Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,     See riot and dishonour stain the brow     Of my young Harry. O that it could be prov'd     That some night-tripping fairy had exchang'd     In cradle clothes our children where they lay,     And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!     Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.     But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,     Of this young Percy's pride? The prisoners     Which he in this adventure hath surpris'd     To his own use he keeps, and sends me word     I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.   West. This is his uncle's teaching, this Worcester,     Malevolent to you In all aspects,     Which makes him prune himself and bristle up     The crest of youth against your dignity.   King. But I have sent for him to answer this;     And for this cause awhile we must neglect     Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.     Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we     Will hold at Windsor. So inform the lords;     But come yourself with speed to us again;     For more is to be said and to be done     Than out of anger can be uttered.   West. I will my liege.                                 Exeunt. Scene II. London. An apartment of the Prince's. Enter Prince of Wales and Sir John Falstaff.   Fal. Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?   Prince. Thou art so fat-witted with drinking of old sack, and     unbuttoning thee after supper, and sleeping upon benches after     noon, that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou     wouldest truly know. What a devil hast thou to do with the time     of the day, Unless hours were cups of sack, and minutes capons,     and clocks the tongues of bawds, and dials the signs of leaping     houses, and the blessed sun himself a fair hot wench in     flame-coloured taffeta, I see no reason why thou shouldst be so     superfluous to demand the time of the day.   Fal. Indeed you come near me now, Hal; for we that take purses go     by the moon And the seven stars, and not by Phoebus, he, that     wand'ring knight so fair. And I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art     king, as, God save thy Grace-Majesty I should say, for grace thou     wilt have none-   Prince. What, none?   Fal. No, by my troth; not so much as will serve to be prologue to     an egg and butter.   Prince. Well, how then? Come, roundly, roundly.   Fal. Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not us that     are squires of the night's body be called thieves of the day's     beauty. Let us be Diana's Foresters, Gentlemen of the Shade,     Minions of the Moon; and let men say we be men of good     government, being governed as the sea is, by our noble and chaste     mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.   Prince. Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the fortune of     us that are the moon's men doth ebb and flow like the sea, being     governed, as the sea is, by the moon. As, for proof now: a purse     of gold most resolutely snatch'd on Monday night and most     dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with swearing 'Lay by,'     and spent with crying 'Bring in'; now ill as low an ebb as the     foot of the ladder, and by-and-by in as high a flow as the ridge     of the gallows.   Fal. By the Lord, thou say'st true, lad- and is not my hostess of     the tavern a most sweet wench?   Prince. As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle- and is not     a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?   Fal. How now, how now, mad wag? What, in thy quips and thy     quiddities? What a plague have I to do with a buff jerkin?   Prince. Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?   Fal. Well, thou hast call'd her to a reckoning many a time and oft.   Prince. Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?   Fal. No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.   Prince. Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch; and     where it would not, I have used my credit.   Fal. Yea, and so us'd it that, were it not here apparent that thou     art heir apparent- But I prithee, sweet wag, shall there be     gallows standing in England when thou art king? and resolution     thus fubb'd as it is with the rusty curb of old father antic the     law? Do not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.   Prince. No; thou shalt.   Fal. Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.   Prince. Thou judgest false already. I mean, thou shalt have the     hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.   Fal. Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my humour as     well as waiting in the court, I can tell you.   Prince. For obtaining of suits?   Fal. Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman hath no lean     wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy as a gib-cat or a lugg'd     bear.   Prince. Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.   Fal. Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.   Prince. What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of Moor     Ditch?   Fal. Thou hast the most unsavoury similes, and art indeed the most     comparative, rascalliest, sweet young prince. But, Hal, I prithee     trouble me no more with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew     where a commodity of good names were to be bought. An old lord of     the Council rated me the other day in the street about you, sir,     but I mark'd him not; and yet he talked very wisely, but I     regarded him not; and yet he talk'd wisely, and in the street     too.   Prince. Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the streets, and     no man regards it.   Fal. O, thou hast damnable iteration, and art indeed able to     corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon me, Hal- God     forgive thee for it! Before I knew thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and     now am I, if a man should speak truly, little better than one of     the wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give it over!     By the Lord, an I do not, I am a villain! I'll be damn'd for     never a king's son in Christendom.   Prince. Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?   Fal. Zounds, where thou wilt, lad! I'll make one. An I do not, call     me villain and baffle me.   Prince. I see a good amendment of life in thee- from praying to     purse-taking.   Fal. Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal. 'Tis no sin for a man to     labour in his vocation.                              Enter Poins.     Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a match. O, if men     were to be saved by merit, what hole in hell were hot enough for     him? This is the most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand!'     to a true man.   Prince. Good morrow, Ned.   Poins. Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse? What     says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack, how agrees the devil and thee     about thy soul, that thou soldest him on Good Friday last for a     cup of Madeira and a cold capon's leg?   Prince. Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have his     bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of proverbs. He will give     the devil his due.   Poins. Then art thou damn'd for keeping thy word with the devil.   Prince. Else he had been damn'd for cozening the devil.   Poins. But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four o'clock     early, at Gadshill! There are pilgrims gong to Canterbury with     rich offerings, and traders riding to London with fat purses. I     have vizards for you all; you have horses for yourselves.     Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester. I have bespoke supper     to-morrow night in Eastcheap. We may do it as secure as sleep. If     you will go, I will stuff your purses full of crowns; if you will     not, tarry at home and be hang'd!   Fal. Hear ye, Yedward: if I tarry at home and go not, I'll hang you     for going.   Poins. You will, chops?   Fal. Hal, wilt thou make one?   Prince. Who, I rob? I a thief? Not I, by my faith.   Fal. There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good fellowship in thee,     nor thou cam'st not of the blood royal if thou darest not stand     for ten shillings.   Prince. Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.   Fal. Why, that's well said.   Prince. Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home.   Fal. By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king.   Prince. I care not.   Poins. Sir John, I prithee, leave the Prince and me alone. I will     lay him down such reasons for this adventure that he shall go.   Fal. Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him the ears     of profiting, that what thou speakest may move and what he hears     may be believed, that the true prince may (for recreation sake)     prove a false thief; for the poor abuses of the time want     countenance. Farewell; you shall find me in Eastcheap.   Prince. Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!                                                   Exit Falstaff.   Poins. Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us to-morrow. I     have a jest to execute that I cannot manage alone. Falstaff,     Bardolph, Peto, and Gadshill shall rob those men that we have     already waylaid; yourself and I will not be there; and when they     have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut this head off     from my shoulders.   Prince. How shall we part with them in setting forth?   Poins. Why, we will set forth before or after them and appoint them     a place of meeting, wherein it is at our pleasure to fail; and     then will they adventure upon the exploit themselves; which they     shall have no sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them.   Prince. Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our horses, by     our habits, and by every other appointment, to be ourselves.   Poins. Tut! our horses they shall not see- I'll tie them in the     wood; our wizards we will change after we leave them; and,     sirrah, I have cases of buckram for the nonce, to immask our     noted outward garments.   Prince. Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.   Poins. Well, for two of them, I know them to be as true-bred     cowards as ever turn'd back; and for the third, if he fight     longer than he sees reason, I'll forswear arms. The virtue of     this jest will lie the incomprehensible lies that this same fat     rogue will tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at least,     he fought with; what wards, what blows, what extremities he     endured; and in the reproof of this lies the jest.   Prince. Well, I'll go with thee. Provide us all things necessary     and meet me to-night in Eastcheap. There I'll sup. Farewell.   Poins. Farewell, my lord.                                Exit.   Prince. I know you all, and will awhile uphold     The unyok'd humour of your idleness.     Yet herein will I imitate the sun,     Who doth permit the base contagious clouds     To smother up his beauty from the world,     That, when he please again to lie himself,     Being wanted, he may be more wond'red at     By breaking through the foul and ugly mists     Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.     If all the year were playing holidays,     To sport would be as tedious as to work;     But when they seldom come, they wish'd-for come,     And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.     So, when this loose behaviour I throw off     And pay the debt I never promised,     By how much better than my word I am,     By so much shall I falsify men's hopes;     And, like bright metal on a sullen ground,     My reformation, glitt'ring o'er my fault,     Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes     Than that which hath no foil to set it off.     I'll so offend to make offence a skill,     Redeeming time when men think least I will.            Exit. Scene III. London. The Palace. Enter the King, Northumberland, Worcester, Hotspur, Sir Walter Blunt, with others.   King. My blood hath been too cold and temperate,     Unapt to stir at these indignities,     And you have found me, for accordingly     You tread upon my patience; but be sure     I will from henceforth rather be myself,     Mighty and to be fear'd, than my condition,     Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,     And therefore lost that title of respect     Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.   Wor. Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves     The scourge of greatness to be us'd on it-     And that same greatness too which our own hands     Have holp to make so portly.   North. My lord-   King. Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see     Danger and disobedience in thine eye.     O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,     And majesty might never yet endure     The moody frontier of a servant brow.     Tou have good leave to leave us. When we need     'Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.                                                  Exit Worcester.     You were about to speak.   North. Yea, my good lord.     Those prisoners in your Highness' name demanded     Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,     Were, as he says, not with such strength denied     As is delivered to your Majesty.     Either envy, therefore, or misprision     Is guilty of this fault, and not my son.   Hot. My liege, I did deny no prisoners.     But I remember, when the fight was done,     When I was dry with rage and extreme toll,     Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,     Came there a certain lord, neat and trimly dress'd,     Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap'd     Show'd like a stubble land at harvest home.     He was perfumed like a milliner,     And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held     A pouncet box, which ever and anon     He gave his nose, and took't away again;     Who therewith angry, when it next came there,     Took it in snuff; and still he smil'd and talk'd;     And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,     He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,     To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse     Betwixt the wind and his nobility.     With many holiday and lady terms     He questioned me, amongst the rest demanded     My prisoners in your Majesty's behalf.     I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,     To be so pest'red with a popingay,     Out of my grief and my impatience     Answer'd neglectingly, I know not what-     He should, or he should not; for he made me mad     To see him shine so brisk, and smell so sweet,     And talk so like a waiting gentlewoman     Of guns and drums and wounds- God save the mark!-     And telling me the sovereignest thing on earth     Was parmacity for an inward bruise;     And that it was great pity, so it was,     This villanous saltpetre should be digg'd     Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,     Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd     So cowardly; and but for these vile 'guns,     He would himself have been a soldier.     This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,     I answered indirectly, as I said,     And I beseech you, let not his report     Come current for an accusation     Betwixt my love and your high majesty.   Blunt. The circumstance considered, good my lord,     Whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said     To such a person, and in such a place,     At such a time, with all the rest retold,     May reasonably die, and never rise     To do him wrong, or any way impeach     What then he said, so he unsay it now.   King. Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,     But with proviso and exception,     That we at our own charge shall ransom straight     His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer;     Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd     The lives of those that he did lead to fight     Against that great magician, damn'd Glendower,     Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March     Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,     Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?     Shall we buy treason? and indent with fears     When they have lost and forfeited themselves?     No, on the barren mountains let him starve!     For I shall never hold that man my friend     Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost     To ransom home revolted Mortimer.   Hot. Revolted Mortimer?     He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,     But by the chance of war. To prove that true     Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,     Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took     When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,     In single opposition hand to hand,     He did confound the best part of an hour     In changing hardiment with great Glendower.     Three times they breath'd, and three times did they drink,     Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;     Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,     Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds     And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,     Bloodstained with these valiant cohabitants.     Never did base and rotten policy     Colour her working with such deadly wounds;     Nor never could the noble Mortimer     Receive so many, and all willingly.     Then let not him be slandered with revolt.   King. Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him!     He never did encounter with Glendower.     I tell thee     He durst as well have met the devil alone     As Owen Glendower for an enemy.     Art thou not asham'd? But, sirrah, henceforth     Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer.     Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,     Or you shall hear in such a kind from me     As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland,     We license your departure with your son.-     Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it.                                  Exeunt King, [Blunt, and Train]   Hot. An if the devil come and roar for them,     I will not send them. I will after straight     And tell him so; for I will else my heart,     Albeit I make a hazard of my head.   North. What, drunk with choler? Stay, and pause awhile.     Here comes your uncle.                           Enter Worcester.   Hot. Speak of Mortimer?     Zounds, I will speak of him, and let my soul     Want mercy if I do not join with him!     Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,     And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,     But I will lift the downtrod Mortimer     As high in the air as this unthankful king,     As this ingrate and cank'red Bolingbroke.   North. Brother, the King hath made your nephew mad.   Wor. Who struck this heat up after I was gone?   Hot. He will (forsooth) have all my prisoners;     And when I urg'd the ransom once again     Of my wive's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,     And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,     Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.   Wor. I cannot blame him. Was not he proclaim'd     By Richard that dead is, the next of blood?   North. He was; I heard the proclamation.     And then it was when the unhappy King     (Whose wrongs in us God pardon!) did set forth     Upon his Irish expedition;     From whence he intercepted did return     To be depos'd, and shortly murdered.   Wor. And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth     Live scandaliz'd and foully spoken of.   Hot. But soft, I pray you. Did King Richard then     Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer     Heir to the crown?   North. He did; myself did hear it.   Hot. Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,     That wish'd him on the barren mountains starve.     But shall it be that you, that set the crown     Upon the head of this forgetful man,     And for his sake wear the detested blot     Of murtherous subornation- shall it be     That you a world of curses undergo,     Being the agents or base second means,     The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?     O, pardon me that I descend so low     To show the line and the predicament     Wherein you range under this subtile king!     Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,     Or fill up chronicles in time to come,     That men of your nobility and power     Did gage them both in an unjust behalf     (As both of you, God pardon it! have done)     To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,     And plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?     And shall it in more shame be further spoken     That you are fool'd, discarded, and shook off     By him for whom these shames ye underwent?     No! yet time serves wherein you may redeem     Your banish'd honours and restore yourselves     Into the good thoughts of the world again;     Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt     Of this proud king, who studies day and night     To answer all the debt he owes to you     Even with the bloody payment of your deaths.     Therefore I say-   Wor. Peace, cousin, say no more;     And now, I will unclasp a secret book,     And to your quick-conceiving discontents     I'll read you matter deep and dangerous,     As full of peril and adventurous spirit     As to o'erwalk a current roaring loud     On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.   Hot. If he fall in, good night, or sink or swim!     Send danger from the east unto the west,     So honour cross it from the north to south,     And let them grapple. O, the blood more stirs     To rouse a lion than to start a hare!   North. Imagination of some great exploit     Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.   Hot. By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap     To pluck bright honour from the pale-fac'd moon,     Or dive into the bottom of the deep,     Where fadom line could never touch the ground,     And pluck up drowned honour by the locks,     So he that doth redeem her thence might wear     Without corrival all her dignities;     But out upon this half-fac'd fellowship!   Wor. He apprehends a world of figures here,     But not the form of what he should attend.     Good cousin, give me audience for a while.   Hot. I cry you mercy.   Wor. Those same noble Scots     That are your prisoners-   Hot. I'll keep them all.     By God, he shall not have a Scot of them!     No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not.     I'll keep them, by this hand!   Wor. You start away.     And lend no ear unto my purposes.     Those prisoners you shall keep.   Hot. Nay, I will! That is flat!     He said he would not ransom Mortimer,     Forbade my tongue to speak of Mortimer,     But I will find him when he lies asleep,     And in his ear I'll holloa 'Mortimer.'     Nay;     I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak     Nothing but 'Mortimer,' and give it him     To keep his anger still in motion.   Wor. Hear you, cousin, a word.   Hot. All studies here I solemnly defy     Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke;     And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales-     But that I think his father loves him not     And would be glad he met with some mischance,     I would have him poisoned with a pot of ale.   Wor. Farewell, kinsman. I will talk to you     When you are better temper'd to attend.   North. Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool     Art thou to break into this woman's mood,     Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!   Hot. Why, look you, I am whipp'd and scourg'd with rods,     Nettled, and stung with pismires when I hear     Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke.     In Richard's time- what do you call the place-     A plague upon it! it is in GIoucestershire-     'Twas where the madcap Duke his uncle kept-     His uncle York- where I first bow'd my knee     Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke-     'S blood!     When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh-   North. At Berkeley Castle.   Hot. You say true.     Why, what a candy deal of courtesy     This fawning greyhound then did proffer me!     Look, 'when his infant fortune came to age,'     And 'gentle Harry Percy,' and 'kind cousin'-     O, the devil take such cozeners!- God forgive me!     Good uncle, tell your tale, for I have done.   Wor. Nay, if you have not, to it again.     We will stay your leisure.   Hot. I have done, i' faith.   Wor. Then once more to your Scottish prisoners.     Deliver them up without their ransom straight,     And make the Douglas' son your only mean     For powers In Scotland; which, for divers reasons     Which I shall send you written, be assur'd     Will easily be granted. [To Northumberland] You, my lord,     Your son in Scotland being thus employ'd,     Shall secretly into the bosom creep     Of that same noble prelate well-belov'd,     The Archbishop.   Hot. Of York, is it not?   Wor. True; who bears hard     His brother's death at Bristow, the Lord Scroop.     I speak not this in estimation,     As what I think might be, but what I know     Is ruminated, plotted, and set down,     And only stays but to behold the face     Of that occasion that shall bring it on.   Hot. I smell it. Upon my life, it will do well.   North. Before the game is afoot thou still let'st slip.   Hot. Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot.     And then the power of Scotland and of York     To join with Mortimer, ha?   Wor. And so they shall.   Hot. In faith, it is exceedingly well aim'd.   Wor. And 'tis no little reason bids us speed,     To save our heads by raising of a head;     For, bear ourselves as even as we can,     The King will always think him in our debt,     And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,     Till he hath found a time to pay us home.     And see already how he doth begin     To make us strangers to his looks of love.   Hot. He does, he does! We'll be reveng'd on him.   Wor. Cousin, farewell. No further go in this     Than I by letters shall direct your course.     When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,     I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer,     Where you and Douglas, and our pow'rs at once,     As I will fashion it, shall happily meet,     To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,     Which now we hold at much uncertainty.   North. Farewell, good brother. We shall thrive, I trust.   Hot. Uncle, adieu. O, let the hours be short     Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport! Exeunt. ACT II. Scene I. Rochester. An inn yard. Enter a Carrier with a lantern in his hand.   1. Car. Heigh-ho! an it be not four by the day, I'll be hang'd.     Charles' wain is over the new chimney, and yet our horse not     pack'd.- What, ostler!   Ost. [within] Anon, anon.   1. Car. I prithee, Tom, beat Cut's saddle, put a few flocks in the     point. Poor jade is wrung in the withers out of all cess.                         Enter another Carrier.   2. Car. Peas and beans are as dank here as a dog, and that is the     next way to give poor jades the bots. This house is turned upside     down since Robin Ostler died.   1. Car. Poor fellow never joyed since the price of oats rose. It     was the death of him.   2. Car. I think this be the most villanous house in all London road     for fleas. I am stung like a tench.   1. Car. Like a tench I By the mass, there is ne'er a king christen     could be better bit than I have been since the first cock.   2. Car. Why, they will allow us ne'er a jordan, and then we leak in     your chimney, and your chamber-lye breeds fleas like a loach.   1. Car. What, ostler! come away and be hang'd! come away!   2. Car. I have a gammon of bacon and two razes of ginger, to be     delivered as far as Charing Cross.   1. Car. God's body! the turkeys in my pannier are quite starved.     What, ostler! A plague on thee! hast thou never an eye in thy     head? Canst not hear? An 'twere not as good deed as drink to     break the pate on thee, I am a very villain. Come, and be hang'd!     Hast no faith in thee?                            Enter Gadshill.   Gads. Good morrow, carriers. What's o'clock?   1. Car. I think it be two o'clock.   Gads. I prithee lend me this lantern to see my gelding in the     stable.   1. Car. Nay, by God, soft! I know a trick worth two of that,     i' faith.   Gads. I pray thee lend me thine.   2. Car. Ay, when? canst tell? Lend me thy lantern, quoth he? Marry,     I'll see thee hang'd first!   Gads. Sirrah carrier, what time do you mean to come to London?   2. Car. Time enough to go to bed with a candle, I warrant thee.     Come, neighbour Mugs, we'll call up the gentlemen. They will     along with company, for they have great charge.                                               Exeunt [Carriers].   Gads. What, ho! chamberlain!                             Enter Chamberlain.   Cham. At hand, quoth pickpurse.   Gads. That's even as fair as- 'at hand, quoth the chamberlain'; for     thou variest no more from picking of purses than giving direction     doth from labouring: thou layest the plot how.   Cham. Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that I told     you yesternight. There's a franklin in the Wild of Kent hath     brought three hundred marks with him in gold. I heard him tell it     to one of his company last night at supper- a kind of auditor;     one that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what. They are     up already and call for eggs and butter. They will away     presently.   Gads. Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas' clerks, I'll     give thee this neck.   Cham. No, I'll none of it. I pray thee keep that for the hangman;     for I know thou worshippest Saint Nicholas as truly as a man of     falsehood may.   Gads. What talkest thou to me of the hangman? If I hang, I'll make     a fat pair of gallows; for if I hang, old Sir John hangs with me,     and thou knowest he is no starveling. Tut! there are other     Troyans that thou dream'st not of, the which for sport sake are     content to do the profession some grace; that would (if matters     should be look'd into) for their own credit sake make all whole.     I am joined with no foot land-rakers, no long-staff sixpenny     strikers, none of these mad mustachio purple-hued maltworms; but     with nobility, and tranquillity, burgomasters and great oneyers,     such as can hold in, such as will strike sooner than speak, and     speak sooner than drink, and drink sooner than pray; and yet,     zounds, I lie; for they pray continually to their saint, the     commonwealth, or rather, not pray to her, but prey on her, for     they ride up and down on her and make her their boots.   Cham. What, the commonwealth their boots? Will she hold out water     in foul way?   Gads. She will, she will! Justice hath liquor'd her. We steal as in     a castle, cocksure. We have the receipt of fernseed, we walk     invisible.   Cham. Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to the night     than to fernseed for your walking invisible.   Gads. Give me thy hand. Thou shalt have a share in our purchase, as     I and a true man.   Cham. Nay, rather let me have it, as you are a false thief.   Gads. Go to; 'homo' is a common name to all men. Bid the ostler     bring my gelding out of the stable. Farewell, you muddy knave.                                                          Exeunt. Scene II. The highway near Gadshill. Enter Prince and Poins.   Poins. Come, shelter, shelter! I have remov'd Falstaff's horse, and     he frets like a gumm'd velvet.   Prince. Stand close.                        [They step aside.]                              Enter Falstaff.   Fal. Poins! Poins, and be hang'd! Poins!   Prince. I comes forward I Peace, ye fat-kidney'd rascal! What a     brawling dost thou keep!   Fal. Where's Poins, Hal?   Prince. He is walk'd up to the top of the hill. I'll go seek him.                                                   [Steps aside.]   Fal. I am accurs'd to rob in that thief's company. The rascal hath     removed my horse and tied him I know not where. If I travel but     four foot by the squire further afoot, I shall break my wind.     Well, I doubt not but to die a fair death for all this, if I     scape hanging for killing that rogue. I have forsworn his company     hourly any time this two-and-twenty years, and yet I am bewitch'd     with the rogue's company. If the rascal have not given me     medicines to make me love him, I'll be hang'd. It could not be     else. I have drunk medicines. Poins! Hal! A plague upon you both!     Bardolph! Peto! I'll starve ere I'll rob a foot further. An     'twere not as good a deed as drink to turn true man and to leave     these rogues, I am the veriest varlet that ever chewed with a     tooth. Eight yards of uneven ground is threescore and ten miles     afoot with me, and the stony-hearted villains know it well     enough. A plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to     another! (They whistle.) Whew! A plague upon you all! Give me my     horse, you rogues! give me my horse and be hang'd!   Prince. [comes forward] Peace, ye fat-guts! Lie down, lay thine ear     close to the ground, and list if thou canst hear the tread of     travellers.   Fal. Have you any levers to lift me up again, being down? 'Sblood,     I'll not bear mine own flesh so far afoot again for all the coin     in thy father's exchequer. What a plague mean ye to colt me thus?   Prince. Thou liest; thou art not colted, thou art uncolted.   Fal. I prithee, good Prince Hal, help me to my horse, good king's     son.   Prince. Out, ye rogue! Shall I be your ostler?   Fal. Go hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent garters! If I be     ta'en, I'll peach for this. An I have not ballads made on you     all, and sung to filthy tunes, let a cup of sack be my poison.     When a jest is so forward- and afoot too- I hate it.              Enter Gadshill, [Bardolph and Peto with him].   Gads. Stand!   Fal. So I do, against my will.   Poins. [comes fortward] O, 'tis our setter. I know his voice.     Bardolph, what news?   Bar. Case ye, case ye! On with your vizards! There's money of the     King's coming down the hill; 'tis going to the King's exchequer.   Fal. You lie, ye rogue! 'Tis going to the King's tavern.   Gads. There's enough to make us all.   Fal. To be hang'd.   Prince. Sirs, you four shall front them in the narrow lane; Ned     Poins and I will walk lower. If they scape from your encounter,     then they light on us.   Peto. How many be there of them?   Gads. Some eight or ten.   Fal. Zounds, will they not rob us?   Prince. What, a coward, Sir John Paunch?   Fal. Indeed, I am not John of Gaunt, your grandfather; but yet no     coward, Hal.   Prince. Well, we leave that to the proof.   Poins. Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge. When thou     need'st him, there thou shalt find him. Farewell and stand fast.   Fal. Now cannot I strike him, if I should be hang'd.   Prince. [aside to Poins] Ned, where are our disguises?   Poins. [aside to Prince] Here, hard by. Stand close.                                       [Exeunt Prince and Poins.]   Fal. Now, my masters, happy man be his dole, say I. Every man to     his business.                          Enter the Travellers.   Traveller. Come, neighbour.     The boy shall lead our horses down the hill;     We'll walk afoot awhile and ease our legs.   Thieves. Stand!   Traveller. Jesus bless us!   Fal. Strike! down with them! cut the villains' throats! Ah,     whoreson caterpillars! bacon-fed knaves! they hate us youth. Down     with them! fleece them!   Traveller. O, we are undone, both we and ours for ever!   Fal. Hang ye, gorbellied knaves, are ye undone? No, ye fat chuffs;     I would your store were here! On, bacons on! What, ye knaves!     young men must live. You are grandjurors, are ye? We'll jure ye,     faith!                             Here they rob and bind them. Exeunt.             Enter the Prince and Poins [in buckram suits].   Prince. The thieves have bound the true men. Now could thou and I     rob the thieves and go merrily to London, it would be argument     for a week, laughter for a month, and a good jest for ever.   Poins. Stand close! I hear them coming.                                              [They stand aside.]                        Enter the Thieves again.   Fal. Come, my masters, let us share, and then to horse before day.     An the Prince and Poins be not two arrant cowards, there's no     equity stirring. There's no more valour in that Poins than in a     wild duck.         [As they are sharing, the Prince and Poins set upon         them. THey all run away, and Falstaff, after a blow or         two, runs awasy too, leaving the booty behind them.]   Prince. Your money!   Poins. Villains!   Prince. Got with much ease. Now merrily to horse.     The thieves are scattered, and possess'd with fear     So strongly that they dare not meet each other.     Each takes his fellow for an officer.     Away, good Ned. Falstaff sweats to death     And lards the lean earth as he walks along.     Were't not for laughing, I should pity him.   Poins. How the rogue roar'd!                           Exeunt. Scene III. Warkworth Castle. Enter Hotspur solus, reading a letter.   Hot. 'But, for mine own part, my lord, I could be well contented to     be there, in respect of the love I bear your house.' He could be     contented- why is he not then? In respect of the love he bears     our house! He shows in this he loves his own barn better than he     loves our house. Let me see some more. 'The purpose you undertake     is dangerous'- Why, that's certain! 'Tis dangerous to take a     cold, to sleep, to drink; but I tell you, my lord fool, out of     this nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety. 'The purpose     you undertake is dangerous, the friends you have named uncertain,     the time itself unsorted, and your whole plot too light for the     counterpoise of so great an opposition.' Say you so, say you so?     I say unto you again, you are a shallow, cowardly hind, and you     lie. What a lack-brain is this! By the Lord, our plot is a good     plot as ever was laid; our friends true and constant: a good     plot, good friends, and full of expectation; an excellent plot,     very good friends. What a frosty-spirited rogue is this! Why, my     Lord of York commends the plot and the general course of the     action. Zounds, an I were now by this rascal, I could brain him     with his lady's fan. Is there not my father, my uncle, and     myself; Lord Edmund Mortimer, my Lord of York, and Owen     Glendower? Is there not, besides, the Douglas? Have I not all     their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the next month,     and are they not some of them set forward already? What a pagan     rascal is this! an infidel! Ha! you shall see now, in very     sincerity of fear and cold heart will he to the King and lay open     all our proceedings. O, I could divide myself and go to buffets     for moving such a dish of skim milk with so honourable an action!     Hang him, let him tell the King! we are prepared. I will set     forward to-night.                          Enter his Lady.     How now, Kate? I must leave you within these two hours.   Lady. O my good lord, why are you thus alone?     For what offence have I this fortnight been     A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed,     Tell me, sweet lord, what is't that takes from thee     Thy stomach, pleasure, and thy golden sleep?     Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth,     And start so often when thou sit'st alone?     Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks     And given my treasures and my rights of thee     To thick-ey'd musing and curs'd melancholy?     In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch'd,     And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars,     Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed,     Cry 'Courage! to the field!' And thou hast talk'd     Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tent,     Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,     Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,     Of prisoners' ransom, and of soldiers slain,     And all the currents of a heady fight.     Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war,     And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep,     That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow     Like bubbles ill a late-disturbed stream,     And in thy face strange motions have appear'd,     Such as we see when men restrain their breath     On some great sudden hest. O, what portents are these?     Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,     And I must know it, else he loves me not.   Hot. What, ho!                     [Enter a Servant.]     Is Gilliams with the packet gone?   Serv. He is, my lord, an hour ago.   Hot. Hath Butler brought those horses from the sheriff?   Serv. One horse, my lord, he brought even now.   Hot. What horse? A roan, a crop-ear, is it not?   Serv. It is, my lord.   Hot. That roan shall be my throne.     Well, I will back him straight. O esperance!     Bid Butler lead him forth into the park.                                                  [Exit Servant.]   Lady. But hear you, my lord.   Hot. What say'st thou, my lady?   Lady. What is it carries you away?   Hot. Why, my horse, my love- my horse!   Lady. Out, you mad-headed ape!     A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen     As you are toss'd with. In faith,     I'll know your business, Harry; that I will!     I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir     About his title and hath sent for you     To line his enterprise; but if you go-   Hot. So far afoot, I shall be weary, love.   Lady. Come, come, you paraquito, answer me     Directly unto this question that I ask.     I'll break thy little finger, Harry,     An if thou wilt not tell my all things true.   Hot. Away.     Away, you trifler! Love? I love thee not;     I care not for thee, Kate. This is no world     To play with mammets and to tilt with lips.     We must have bloody noses and crack'd crowns,     And pass them current too. Gods me, my horse!     What say'st thou, Kate? What wouldst thou have with me?   Lady. Do you not love me? do you not indeed?     Well, do not then; for since you love me not,     I will not love myself. Do you not love me?     Nay, tell me if you speak in jest or no.   Hot. Come, wilt thou see me ride?     And when I am a-horseback, I will swear     I love thee infinitely. But hark you. Kate:     I must not have you henceforth question me     Whither I go, nor reason whereabout.     Whither I must, I must; and to conclude,     This evening must I leave you, gentle Kate.     I know you wise; but yet no farther wise     Than Harry Percy's wife; constant you are,     But yet a woman; and for secrecy,     No lady closer, for I well believe     Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know,     And so far will I trust thee, gentle Kate.   Lady. How? so far?   Hot. Not an inch further. But hark you, Kate:     Whither I go, thither shall you go too;     To-day will I set forth, to-morrow you.     Will this content you, Kate,?   Lady. It must of force.                                Exeunt. Scene IV. Eastcheap. The Boar's Head Tavern. Enter Prince and Poins.   Prince. Ned, prithee come out of that fat-room and lend me thy hand     to laugh a little.   Poins. Where hast been, Hal?     Prince,. With three or four loggerheads amongst three or     fourscore hogsheads. I have sounded the very bass-string of     humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers and     can call them all by their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and     Francis. They take it already upon their salvation that, though     I be but Prince of Wales, yet I am the king of courtesy; and tell     me flatly I am no proud Jack like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a     lad of mettle, a good boy (by the Lord, so they call me!), and     when I am King of England I shall command all the good lads     Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dying scarlet; and when     you breathe in your watering, they cry 'hem!' and bid you play it     off. To conclude, I am so good a proficient in one quarter of an     hour that I can drink with any tinker in his own language during     my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost much honour that thou     wert not with me in this action. But, sweet Ned- to sweeten which     name of Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapp'd even     now into my hand by an under-skinker, one that never spake other     English in his life than 'Eight shillings and sixpence,' and 'You     are welcome,' with this shrill addition, 'Anon, anon, sir! Score     a pint of bastard in the Half-moon,' or so- but, Ned, to drive     away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee do thou stand in some     by-room while I question my puny drawer to what end be gave me     the sugar; and do thou never leave calling 'Francis!' that his     tale to me may be nothing but 'Anon!' Step aside, and I'll show     thee a precedent.   Poins. Francis!   Prince. Thou art perfect.   Poins. Francis!                                  [Exit Poins.]                     Enter [Francis, a] Drawer.   Fran. Anon, anon, sir.- Look down into the Pomgarnet, Ralph.   Prince. Come hither, Francis.   Fran. My lord?   Prince. How long hast thou to serve, Francis?   Fran. Forsooth, five years, and as much as to-   Poins. [within] Francis!   Fran. Anon, anon, sir.   Prince. Five year! by'r Lady, a long lease for the clinking of     Pewter. But, Francis, darest thou be so valiant as to play the     coward with thy indenture and show it a fair pair of heels and     run from it?   Fran. O Lord, sir, I'll be sworn upon all the books in England I     could find in my heart-   Poins. [within] Francis!   Fran. Anon, sir.   Prince. How old art thou, Francis?   Fran. Let me see. About Michaelmas next I shall be-   Poins. [within] Francis!   Fran. Anon, sir. Pray stay a little, my lord.   Prince. Nay, but hark you, Francis. For the sugar thou gavest me-     'twas a pennyworth, wast not?   Fran. O Lord! I would it had been two!   Prince. I will give thee for it a thousand pound. Ask me when thou     wilt, and, thou shalt have it.   Poins. [within] Francis!   Fran. Anon, anon.   Prince. Anon, Francis? No, Francis; but to-morrow, Francis; or,     Francis, a Thursday; or indeed, Francis, when thou wilt. But     Francis-   Fran. My lord?   Prince. Wilt thou rob this leathern-jerkin, crystal-button,     not-pated, agate-ring, puke-stocking, caddis-garter,     smooth-tongue, Spanish-pouch-   Fran. O Lord, sir, who do you mean?   Prince. Why then, your brown bastard is your only drink; for look     you, Francis, your white canvas doublet will sully. In Barbary,     sir, it cannot come to so much.   Fran. What, sir?   Poins. [within] Francis!   Prince. Away, you rogue! Dost thou not hear them call?               Here they both call him. The Drawer stands amazed,                                     not knowing which way to go.                          Enter Vintner.   Vint. What, stand'st thou still, and hear'st such a calling? Look     to the guests within. [Exit Francis.] My lord, old Sir John, with     half-a-dozen more, are at the door. Shall I let them in?   Prince. Let them alone awhile, and then open the door.                                                   [Exit Vintner.]     Poins!   Poins. [within] Anon, anon, sir.                           Enter Poins.   Prince. Sirrah, Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are at the     door. Shall we be merry?   Poins. As merry as crickets, my lad. But hark ye; what cunning     match have you made with this jest of the drawer? Come, what's     the issue?   Prince. I am now of all humours that have showed themselves humours     since the old days of goodman Adam to the pupil age of this     present this twelve o'clock at midnight.                          [Enter Francis.]     What's o'clock, Francis?   Fran. Anon, anon, sir.                                 [Exit.]   Prince. That ever this fellow should have fewer words than a     parrot, and yet the son of a woman! His industry is upstairs and     downstairs, his eloquence the parcel of a reckoning. I am not yet     of Percy's mind, the Hotspur of the North; he that kills me some     six or seven dozen of Scots at a breakfast, washes his hands, and     says to his wife, 'Fie upon this quiet life! I want work.' 'O my     sweet Harry,' says she, 'how many hast thou  kill'd to-day?'     'Give my roan horse a drench,' says he, and answers 'Some     fourteen,' an hour after, 'a trifle, a trifle.' I prithee call in     Falstaff. I'll play Percy, and that damn'd brawn shall play Dame     Mortimer his wife. 'Rivo!' says the drunkard. Call in ribs, call     in tallow.            Enter Falstaff, [Gadshill, Bardolph, and Peto;                    Francis follows with wine].   Poins. Welcome, Jack. Where hast thou been?   Fal. A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance too! Marry and     amen! Give me a cup of sack, boy. Ere I lead this life long, I'll     sew nether-stocks, and mend them and foot them too. A plague of     all cowards! Give me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there no virtue     extant?                                                     He drinketh.   Prince. Didst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of butter?     Pitiful-hearted butter, that melted at the sweet tale of the sun!     If thou didst, then behold that compound.   Fal. You rogue, here's lime in this sack too! There is nothing but     roguery to be found in villanous man. Yet a coward is worse than     a cup of sack with lime in it- a villanous coward! Go thy ways,     old Jack, die when thou wilt; if manhood, good manhood, be not     forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I a shotten herring.     There lives not three good men unhang'd in England; and one of     them is fat, and grows old. God help the while! A bad world, I     say. I would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or anything. A     plague of all cowards I say still!   Prince. How now, woolsack? What mutter you?   Fal. A king's son! If I do not beat thee out of thy kingdom with a     dagger of lath and drive all thy subjects afore thee like a flock     of wild geese, I'll never wear hair on my face more. You Prince     of Wales?   Prince. Why, you whoreson round man, what's the matter?   Fal. Are not you a coward? Answer me to that- and Poins there?   Poins. Zounds, ye fat paunch, an ye call me coward, by the     Lord, I'll stab thee.   Fal. I call thee coward? I'll see thee damn'd ere I call thee     coward, but I would give a thousand pound I could run as fast as     thou canst. You are straight enough in the shoulders; you care     not who sees Your back. Call you that backing of your friends? A     plague upon such backing! Give me them that will face me. Give me     a cup of sack. I am a rogue if I drunk to-day.   Prince. O villain! thy lips are scarce wip'd since thou drunk'st     last.   Fal. All is one for that. (He drinketh.) A plague of all cowards     still say I.   Prince. What's the matter?   Fal. What's the matter? There be four of us here have ta'en a     thousand pound this day morning.   Prince. Where is it, Jack? Where is it?   Fal. Where is it, Taken from us it is. A hundred upon poor four of     us!   Prince. What, a hundred, man?   Fal. I am a rogue if I were not at half-sword with a dozen of them     two hours together. I have scap'd by miracle. I am eight times     thrust through the doublet, four through the hose; my buckler cut     through and through; my sword hack'd like a handsaw- ecce signum!     I never dealt better since I was a man. All would not do. A     plague of all cowards! Let them speak, If they speak more or less     than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness.   Prince. Speak, sirs. How was it?   Gads. We four set upon some dozen-   Fal. Sixteen at least, my lord.   Gads. And bound them.   Peto. No, no, they were not bound.   Fal. You rogue, they were bound, every man of them, or I am a Jew     else- an Ebrew Jew.   Gads. As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men sea upon us-   Fal. And unbound the rest, and then come in the other.   Prince. What, fought you with them all?   Fal. All? I know not what you call all, but if I fought not with     fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish! If there were not two or     three and fifty upon poor old Jack, then am I no two-legg'd     creature.   Prince. Pray God you have not murd'red some of them.   Fal. Nay, that's past praying for. I have pepper'd two of them. Two     I am sure I have paid, two rogues in buckram suits. I tell thee     what, Hal- if I tell thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse.     Thou knowest my old ward. Here I lay, and thus I bore my point.     Four rogues in buckram let drive at me.   Prince. What, four? Thou saidst but two even now.   Fal. Four, Hal. I told thee four.   Poins. Ay, ay, he said four.   Fal. These four came all afront and mainly thrust at me. I made me     no more ado but took all their seven points in my target, thus.   Prince. Seven? Why, there were but four even now.   Fal. In buckram?   Poins. Ay, four, in buckram suits.   Fal. Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else.   Prince. [aside to Poins] Prithee let him alone. We shall have more     anon.   Fal. Dost thou hear me, Hal?   Prince. Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.   Fal. Do so, for it is worth the list'ning to. These nine in buckram     that I told thee of-   Prince. So, two more already.   Fal. Their points being broken-   Poins. Down fell their hose.   Fal. Began to give me ground; but I followed me close, came in,     foot and hand, and with a thought seven of the eleven I paid.   Prince. O monstrous! Eleven buckram men grown out of two!   Fal. But, as the devil would have it, three misbegotten knaves in     Kendal green came at my back and let drive at me; for it was so     dark, Hal, that thou couldst not see thy hand.   Prince. These lies are like their father that begets them- gross as     a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou clay-brain'd guts, thou     knotty-pated fool, thou whoreson obscene greasy tallow-catch-   Fal. What, art thou mad? art thou mad? Is not the truth the truth?   Prince. Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal green when     it was so dark thou couldst not see thy hand? Come, tell us your     reason. What sayest thou to this?   Poins. Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.   Fal. What, upon compulsion? Zounds, an I were at the strappado or     all the racks in the world, I would not tell you on compulsion.     Give you a reason on compulsion? If reasons were as plentiful as     blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon compulsion, I.   Prince. I'll be no longer guilty, of this sin; this sanguine     coward, this bed-presser, this horseback-breaker, this huge hill     of flesh-   Fal. 'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried     neat's-tongue, you bull's sizzle, you stockfish- O for breath to     utter what is like thee!- you tailor's yard, you sheath, you     bowcase, you vile standing tuck!   Prince. Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again; and when thou     hast tired thyself in base comparisons, hear me speak but this.   Poins. Mark, Jack.   Prince. We two saw you four set on four, and bound them and were     masters of their wealth. Mark now how a plain tale shall put you     down. Then did we two set on you four and, with a word, outfac'd     you from your prize, and have it; yea, and can show it you here     in the house. And, Falstaff, you carried your guts away as     nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roar'd for mercy, and still     run and roar'd, as ever I heard bullcalf. What a slave art thou     to hack thy sword as thou hast done, and then say it was in     fight! What trick, what device, what starting hole canst thou now     find out to hide thee from this open and apparent shame?   Poins. Come, let's hear, Jack. What trick hast thou now?   Fal. By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye. Why, hear     you, my masters. Was it for me to kill the heir apparent? Should     I turn upon the true prince? Why, thou knowest I am as valiant as     Hercules; but beware instinct. The lion will not touch the true     prince. Instinct is a great matter. I was now a coward on     instinct. I shall think the better of myself, and thee, during my     life- I for a valiant lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by     the Lord, lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess, clap to     the doors. Watch to-night, pray to-morrow. Gallants, lads, boys,     hearts of gold, all the titles of good fellowship come to you!     What, shall we be merry? Shall we have a play extempore?   Prince. Content- and the argument shall be thy running away.   Fal. Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me!                              Enter Hostess.   Host. O Jesu, my lord the Prince!   Prince. How now, my lady the hostess? What say'st thou to me?   Host. Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the court at door     would speak with you. He says he comes from your father.   Prince. Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and send him     back again to my mother.   Fal. What manner of man is he?   Host. An old man.   Fal. What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall I give him     his answer?   Prince. Prithee do, Jack.   Fal. Faith, and I'll send him packing. Exit.   Prince. Now, sirs. By'r Lady, you fought fair; so did you, Peto; so     did you, Bardolph. You are lions too, you ran away upon instinct,     you will not touch the true prince; no- fie!   Bard. Faith, I ran when I saw others run.   Prince. Tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's sword so     hack'd?   Peto. Why, he hack'd it with his dagger, and said he would swear     truth out of England but he would make you believe it was done in     fight, and persuaded us to do the like.   Bard. Yea, and to tickle our noses with speargrass to make them     bleed, and then to beslubber our garments with it and swear it     was the blood of true men. I did that I did not this seven year     before- I blush'd to hear his monstrous devices.   Prince. O villain! thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years ago     and wert taken with the manner, and ever since thou hast blush'd     extempore. Thou hadst fire and sword on thy side, and yet thou     ran'st away. What instinct hadst thou for it?   Bard. My lord, do you see these meteors? Do you behold these     exhalations?   Prince. I do.   Bard. What think you they portend?   Prince. Hot livers and cold purses.   Bard. Choler, my lord, if rightly taken.   Prince. No, if rightly taken, halter.                          Enter Falstaff.     Here comes lean Jack; here comes bare-bone. How now, my sweet     creature of bombast? How long is't ago, Jack, since thou sawest     thine own knee?   Fal. My own knee? When I was about thy years, Hal, I was not an     eagle's talent in the waist; I could have crept into any     alderman's thumb-ring. A plague of sighing and grief! It blows a     man up like a bladder. There's villanous news abroad. Here was     Sir John Bracy from your father. You must to the court in the     morning. That same mad fellow of the North, Percy, and he of     Wales that gave Amamon the bastinado, and made Lucifer cuckold,     and swore the devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh     hook- what a plague call you him?   Poins. O, Glendower.   Fal. Owen, Owen- the same; and his son-in-law Mortimer, and old     Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of Scots, Douglas, that     runs a-horseback up a hill perpendicular-   Prince. He that rides at high speed and with his pistol kills a     sparrow flying.   Fal. You have hit it.   Prince. So did he never the sparrow.   Fal. Well, that rascal hath good metal in him; he will not run.   Prince. Why, what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so for     running!   Fal. A-horseback, ye cuckoo! but afoot he will not budge a foot.   Prince. Yes, Jack, upon instinct.   Fal. I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too, and one     Mordake, and a thousand bluecaps more. Worcester is stol'n away     to-night; thy father's beard is turn'd white with the news; you     may buy land now as cheap as stinking mack'rel.   Prince. Why then, it is like, if there come a hot June, and this     civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads as they buy     hobnails, by the hundreds.   Fal. By the mass, lad, thou sayest true; it is like we shall have     good trading that way. But tell me, Hal, art not thou horrible     afeard? Thou being heir apparent, could the world pick thee out     three such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that spirit     Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou not horribly afraid?     Doth not thy blood thrill at it?   Prince. Not a whit, i' faith. I lack some of thy instinct.   Fal. Well, thou wilt be horribly chid to-morrow when thou comest to     thy father. If thou love file, practise an answer.   Prince. Do thou stand for my father and examine me upon the     particulars of my life.   Fal. Shall I? Content. This chair shall be my state, this dagger my     sceptre, and this cushion my, crown.   Prince. Thy state is taken for a join'd-stool, thy golden sceptre     for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich crown for a pitiful     bald crown.   Fal. Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee, now shalt     thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to make my eyes look red,     that it may be thought I have wept; for I must speak in passion,     and I will do it in King Cambyses' vein.   Prince. Well, here is my leg.   Fal. And here is my speech. Stand aside, nobility.   Host. O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i' faith!   Fal. Weep not, sweet queen, for trickling tears are vain.   Host. O, the Father, how he holds his countenance!   Fal. For God's sake, lords, convey my tristful queen!     For tears do stop the floodgates of her eyes.   Host. O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry players as     ever I see!   Fal. Peace, good pintpot. Peace, good tickle-brain.- Harry, I do     not only marvel where thou spendest thy time, but also how thou     art accompanied. For though the camomile, the more it is trodden     on, the faster it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted, the     sooner it wears. That thou art my son I have partly thy mother's     word, partly my own opinion, but chiefly a villanous trick of     thine eye and a foolish hanging of thy nether lip that doth     warrant me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point: why,     being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall the blessed sun of     heaven prove a micher and eat blackberries? A question not to be     ask'd. Shall the son of England prove a thief and take purses? A     question to be ask'd. There is a thing, Harry, which thou hast     often heard of, and it is known to many in our land by the name     of pitch. This pitch, as ancient writers do report, doth defile;     so doth the company thou keepest. For, Harry, now I do not speak     to thee in drink, but in tears; not in pleasure, but in passion;     not in words only, but in woes also: and yet there is a virtuous     man whom I have often noted in thy company, but I know not his     name.   Prince. What manner of man, an it like your Majesty?   Fal. A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent; of a cheerful     look, a pleasing eye, and a most noble carriage; and, as I think,     his age some fifty, or, by'r Lady, inclining to threescore; and     now I remember me, his name is Falstaff. If that man should be     lewdly, given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry, I see virtue in his     looks. If then the tree may be known by the fruit, as the fruit     by the tree, then, peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in     that Falstaff. Him keep with, the rest banish. And tell me now,     thou naughty varlet, tell me where hast thou been this month?   Prince. Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me, and I'll     play my father.   Fal. Depose me? If thou dost it half so gravely, so majestically,     both in word and matter, hang me up by the heels for a     rabbit-sucker or a poulter's hare.   Prince. Well, here I am set.   Fal. And here I stand. Judge, my masters.   Prince. Now, Harry, whence come you?   Fal. My noble lord, from Eastcheap.   Prince. The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.   Fal. 'Sblood, my lord, they are false! Nay, I'll tickle ye for a     young prince, i' faith.   Prince. Swearest thou, ungracious boy? Henceforth ne'er look on me.     Thou art violently carried away from grace. There is a devil     haunts thee in the likeness of an old fat man; a tun of man is     thy companion. Why dost thou converse with that trunk of humours,     that bolting hutch of beastliness, that swoll'n parcel of     dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuff'd cloakbag of     guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly,     that reverend vice, that grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that     vanity in years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and drink     it? wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a capon and eat it?     wherein cunning, but in craft? wherein crafty, but in villany?     wherein villanous, but in all things? wherein worthy, but in     nothing?   Fal. I would your Grace would take me with you. Whom means your     Grace?   Prince. That villanous abominable misleader of youth, Falstaff,     that old white-bearded Satan.   Fal. My lord, the man I know.   Prince. I know thou dost.   Fal. But to say I know more harm in him than in myself were to say     more than I know. That he is old (the more the pity) his white     hairs do witness it; but that he is (saving your reverence) a     whoremaster, that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault,     God help the wicked! If to be old and merry be a sin, then many     an old host that I know is damn'd. If to be fat be to be hated,     then Pharaoh's lean kine are to be loved. No, my good lord.     Banish Peto, banish Bardolph, banish Poins; but for sweet Jack     Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff, valiant Jack     Falstaff, and therefore more valiant being, as he is, old Jack     Falstaff, banish not him thy Harry's company, banish not him thy     Harry's company. Banish plump Jack, and banish all the world!   Prince. I do, I will.                      [A knocking heard.]                         [Exeunt Hostess, Francis, and Bardolph.]                      Enter Bardolph, running.   Bard. O, my lord, my lord! the sheriff with a most monstrous watch     is at the door.   Fal. Out, ye rogue! Play out the play. I have much to say in the     behalf of that Falstaff.                        Enter the Hostess.   Host. O Jesu, my lord, my lord!   Prince. Heigh, heigh, the devil rides upon a fiddlestick!     What's the matter?   Host. The sheriff and all the watch are at the door. They are come     to search the house. Shall I let them in?   Fal. Dost thou hear, Hal? Never call a true piece of gold a     counterfeit. Thou art essentially mad without seeming so.   Prince. And thou a natural coward without instinct.   Fal. I deny your major. If you will deny the sheriff, so; if not,     let him enter. If I become not a cart as well as another man, a     plague on my bringing up! I hope I shall as soon be strangled     with a halter as another.   Prince. Go hide thee behind the arras. The rest walk, up above.     Now, my masters, for a true face and good conscience.   Fal. Both which I have had; but their date is out, and therefore     I'll hide me.                                          Exit.   Prince. Call in the sheriff.                             [Exeunt Manent the Prince and Peto.]                     Enter Sheriff and the Carrier.     Now, Master Sheriff, what is your will with me?   Sher. First, pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry     Hath followed certain men unto this house.   Prince. What men?   Sher. One of them is well known, my gracious lord-     A gross fat man.   Carrier. As fat as butter.   Prince. The man, I do assure you, is not here,     For I myself at this time have employ'd him.     And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee     That I will by to-morrow dinner time     Send him to answer thee, or any man,     For anything he shall be charg'd withal;     And so let me entreat you leave the house.   Sher. I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen     Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.   Prince. It may be so. If he have robb'd these men,     He shall be answerable; and so farewell.   Sher. Good night, my noble lord.   Prince. I think it is good morrow, is it not?   Sher. Indeed, my lord, I think it be two o'clock.                                             Exit [with Carrier].   Prince. This oily rascal is known as well as Paul's. Go call him     forth.   Peto. Falstaff! Fast asleep behind the arras, and snorting like a     horse.   Prince. Hark how hard he fetches breath. Search his pockets.             He searcheth his pockets and findeth certain papers.     What hast thou found?   Peto. Nothing but papers, my lord.   Prince. Let's see whit they be. Read them.   Peto. [reads] 'Item. A capon. . . . . . . . . . . . .  ii s. ii d.                  Item, Sauce. . . . . . . . . . . . . .      iiii d.                  Item, Sack two gallons . . . . . . . . v s. viii d.                  Item, Anchovies and sack after supper.  ii s. vi d.                  Item, Bread. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ob.'   Prince. O monstrous! but one halfpennyworth of bread to this     intolerable deal of sack! What there is else, keep close; we'll     read it at more advantage. There let him sleep till day. I'll to     the court in the morning . We must all to the wars. and thy place     shall be honourable. I'll procure this fat rogue a charge of     foot; and I know, his death will be a march of twelve score. The     money shall be paid back again with advantage. Be with me betimes     in the morning, and so good morrow, Peto.   Peto. Good morrow, good my lord.                                                          Exeunt. ACT III. Scene I. Bangor. The Archdeacon's house. Enter Hotspur, Worcester, Lord Mortimer, Owen Glendower.   Mort. These promises are fair, the parties sure,     And our induction full of prosperous hope.   Hot. Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,     Will you sit down?     And uncle Worcester. A plague upon it!     I have forgot the map.   Glend. No, here it is.     Sit, cousin Percy; sit, good cousin Hotspur,     For by that name as oft as Lancaster     Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale, and with     A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.   Hot. And you in hell, as oft as he hears     Owen Glendower spoke of.   Glend. I cannot blame him. At my nativity     The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes     Of burning cressets, and at my birth     The frame and huge foundation of the earth     Shak'd like a coward.   Hot. Why, so it would have done at the same season, if your     mother's cat had but kitten'd, though yourself had never been     born.   Glend. I say the earth did shake when I was born.   Hot. And I say the earth was not of my mind,     If you suppose as fearing you it shook.   Glend. The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble.   Hot. O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,     And not in fear of your nativity.     Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth     In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth     Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd     By the imprisoning of unruly wind     Within her womb, which, for enlargement striving,     Shakes the old beldame earth and topples down     Steeples and mossgrown towers. At your birth     Our grandam earth, having this distemp'rature,     In passion shook.   Glend. Cousin, of many men     I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave     To tell you once again that at my birth     The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,     The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds     Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.     These signs have mark'd me extraordinary,     And all the courses of my life do show     I am not in the roll of common men.     Where is he living, clipp'd in with the sea     That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,     Which calls me pupil or hath read to me?     And bring him out that is but woman's son     Can trace me in the tedious ways of art     And hold me pace in deep experiments.   Hot. I think there's no man speaks better Welsh. I'll to dinner.   Mort. Peace, cousin Percy; you will make him mad.   Glend. I can call spirits from the vasty deep.   Hot. Why, so can I, or so can any man;     But will they come when you do call for them?   Glend. Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command the devil.   Hot. And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil-     By telling truth. Tell truth and shame the devil.     If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,     And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.     O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!   Mort. Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat.   Glend. Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head     Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye     And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him     Bootless home and weather-beaten back.   Hot. Home without boots, and in foul weather too?     How scapes he agues, in the devil's name   Glend. Come, here's the map. Shall we divide our right     According to our threefold order ta'en?   Mort. The Archdeacon hath divided it     Into three limits very equally.     England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,     By south and east is to my part assign'd;     All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,     And all the fertile land within that bound,     To Owen Glendower; and, dear coz, to you     The remnant northward lying off from Trent.     And our indentures tripartite are drawn;     Which being sealed interchangeably     (A business that this night may execute),     To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I     And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth     To meet your father and the Scottish bower,     As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.     My father Glendower is not ready yet,     Nor shall we need his help these fourteen days.     [To Glend.] Within that space you may have drawn together     Your tenants, friends, and neighbouring gentlemen.   Glend. A shorter time shall send me to you, lords;     And in my conduct shall your ladies come,     From whom you now must steal and take no leave,     For there will be a world of water shed     Upon the parting of your wives and you.   Hot. Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,     In quantity equals not one of yours.     See how this river comes me cranking in     And cuts me from the best of all my land     A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.     I'll have the current ill this place damm'd up,     And here the smug and sliver Trent shall run     In a new channel fair and evenly.     It shall not wind with such a deep indent     To rob me of so rich a bottom here.   Glend. Not wind? It shall, it must! You see it doth.   Mort. Yea, but     Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up     With like advantage on the other side,     Gelding the opposed continent as much     As on the other side it takes from you.   Wor. Yea, but a little charge will trench him here     And on this north side win this cape of land;     And then he runs straight and even.   Hot. I'll have it so. A little charge will do it.   Glend. I will not have it alt'red.   Hot. Will not you?   Glend. No, nor you shall not.   Hot. Who shall say me nay?   Glend. No, that will I.   Hot. Let me not understand you then; speak it in Welsh.   Glend. I can speak English, lord, as well as you;     For I was train'd up in the English court,     Where, being but young, I framed to the harp     Many an English ditty lovely well,     And gave the tongue a helpful ornament-     A virtue that was never seen in you.   Hot. Marry,     And I am glad of it with all my heart!     I had rather be a kitten and cry mew     Than one of these same metre ballet-mongers.     I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd     Or a dry wheel grate on the axletree,     And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,     Nothing so much as mincing poetry.     'Tis like the forc'd gait of a shuffling nag,   Glend. Come, you shall have Trent turn'd.   Hot. I do not care. I'll give thrice so much land     To any well-deserving friend;     But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,     I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair     Are the indentures drawn? Shall we be gone?   Glend. The moon shines fair; you may away by night.     I'll haste the writer, and withal     Break with your wives of your departure hence.     I am afraid my daughter will run mad,     So much she doteth on her Mortimer.                    Exit.   Mort. Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!   Hot. I cannot choose. Sometimes he angers me     With telling me of the moldwarp and the ant,     Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,     And of a dragon and a finless fish,     A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,     A couching lion and a ramping cat,     And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff     As puts me from my faith. I tell you what-     He held me last night at least nine hours     In reckoning up the several devils' names     That were his lackeys. I cried 'hum,' and 'Well, go to!'     But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious     As a tired horse, a railing wife;     Worse than a smoky house. I had rather live     With cheese and garlic in a windmill far     Than feed on cates and have him talk to me     In any summer house in Christendom).   Mort. In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,     Exceedingly well read, and profited     In strange concealments, valiant as a lion,     And wondrous affable, and as bountiful     As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?     He holds your temper in a high respect     And curbs himself even of his natural scope     When you come 'cross his humour. Faith, he does.     I warrant you that man is not alive     Might so have tempted him as you have done     Without the taste of danger and reproof.     But do not use it oft, let me entreat you.   Wor. In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame,     And since your coming hither have done enough     To put him quite besides his patience.     You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault.     Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood-     And that's the dearest grace it renders you-     Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,     Defect of manners, want of government,     Pride, haughtiness, opinion, and disdain;     The least of which haunting a nobleman     Loseth men's hearts, and leaves behind a stain     Upon the beauty of all parts besides,     Beguiling them of commendation.   Hot. Well, I am school'd. Good manners be your speed!     Here come our wives, and let us take our leave.             Enter Glendower with the Ladies.   Mort. This is the deadly spite that angers me-     My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh.   Glend. My daughter weeps; she will not part with you;     She'll be a soldier too, she'll to the wars.   Mort. Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy     Shall follow in your conduct speedily.                Glendower speaks to her in Welsh, and she answers                                                 him in the same.   Glend. She is desperate here. A peevish self-will'd harlotry,     One that no persuasion can do good upon.                                        The Lady speaks in Welsh.   Mort. I understand thy looks. That pretty Welsh     Which thou pourest down from these swelling heavens     I am too perfect in; and, but for shame,     In such a Barley should I answer thee.                                         The Lady again in Welsh.     I understand thy kisses, and thou mine,     And that's a feeling disputation.     But I will never be a truant, love,     Till I have learnt thy language: for thy tongue     Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd,     Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bow'r,     With ravishing division, to her lute.   Glend. Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad.                                  The Lady speaks again in Welsh.   Mort. O, I am ignorance itself in this!   Glend. She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down     And rest your gentle head upon her lap,     And she will sing the song that pleaseth you     And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep,     Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,     Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep     As is the difference betwixt day and night     The hour before the heavenly-harness'd team     Begins his golden progress in the East.   Mort. With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing.     By that time will our book, I think, be drawn.   Glend. Do so,     And those musicians that shall play to you     Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,     And straight they shall be here. Sit, and attend.   Hot. Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down. Come, quick,     quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap.   Lady P. Go, ye giddy goose.                                                 The music plays.   Hot. Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh;     And 'tis no marvel, be is so humorous.     By'r Lady, he is a good musician.   Lady P. Then should you be nothing but musical; for you are     altogether govern'd by humours. Lie still, ye thief, and hear the     lady sing in Welsh.   Hot. I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish.   Lady P. Wouldst thou have thy head broken?   Hot. No.   Lady P. Then be still.   Hot. Neither! 'Tis a woman's fault.   Lady P. Now God help thee!   Hot. To the Welsh lady's bed.   Lady P. What's that?   Hot. Peace! she sings.                                Here the Lady sings a Welsh song.     Come, Kate, I'll have your song too.   Lady P. Not mine, in good sooth.   Hot. Not yours, in good sooth? Heart! you swear like a     comfit-maker's wife. 'Not you, in good sooth!' and 'as true as I     live!' and 'as God shall mend me!' and 'as sure as day!'     And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths     As if thou ne'er walk'st further than Finsbury.     Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,     A good mouth-filling oath; and leave 'in sooth'     And such protest of pepper gingerbread     To velvet guards and Sunday citizens. Come, sing.   Lady P. I will not sing.   Hot. 'Tis the next way to turn tailor or be redbreast-teacher. An     the indentures be drawn, I'll away within these two hours; and so     come in when ye will.                                  Exit.   Glend. Come, come, Lord Mortimer. You are as slow     As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go.     By this our book is drawn; we'll but seal,     And then to horse immediately.   Mort. With all my heart.                                                          Exeunt. Scene II. London. The Palace. Enter the King, Prince of Wales, and others.   King. Lords, give us leave. The Prince of Wales and I     Must have some private conference; but be near at hand,     For we shall presently have need of you.                                                    Exeunt Lords.     I know not whether God will have it so,     For some displeasing service I have done,     That, in his secret doom, out of my blood     He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me;     But thou dost in thy passages of life     Make me believe that thou art only mark'd     For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven     To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,     Could such inordinate and low desires,     Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,     Such barren pleasures, rude society,     As thou art match'd withal and grafted to,     Accompany the greatness of thy blood     And hold their level with thy princely heart?   Prince. So please your Majesty, I would I could     Quit all offences with as clear excuse     As well as I am doubtless I can purge     Myself of many I am charged withal.     Yet such extenuation let me beg     As, in reproof of many tales devis'd,     Which oft the ear of greatness needs must bear     By, smiling pickthanks and base newsmongers,     I may, for some things true wherein my youth     Hath faulty wand'red and irregular,     And pardon on lily true submission.   King. God pardon thee! Yet let me wonder, Harry,     At thy affections, which do hold a wing,     Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.     Thy place in Council thou hast rudely lost,     Which by thy younger brother is supplied,     And art almost an alien to the hearts     Of all the court and princes of my blood.     The hope and expectation of thy time     Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man     Prophetically do forethink thy fall.     Had I so lavish of my presence been,     So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,     So stale and cheap to vulgar company,     Opinion, that did help me to the crown,     Had still kept loyal to possession     And left me in reputeless banishment,     A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.     By being seldom seen, I could not stir     But, like a comet, I Was wond'red at;     That men would tell their children, 'This is he!'     Others would say, 'Where? Which is Bolingbroke?'     And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,     And dress'd myself in such humility     That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,     Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths     Even in the presence of the crowned King.     Thus did I keep my person fresh and new,     My presence, like a robe pontifical,     Ne'er seen but wond'red at; and so my state,     Seldom but sumptuous, show'd like a feast     And won by rareness such solemnity.     The skipping King, he ambled up and down     With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,     Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state;     Mingled his royalty with cap'ring fools;     Had his great name profaned with their scorns     And gave his countenance, against his name,     To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push     Of every beardless vain comparative;     Grew a companion to the common streets,     Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;     That, being dally swallowed by men's eyes,     They surfeited with honey and began     To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little     More than a little is by much too much.     So, when he had occasion to be seen,     He was but as the cuckoo is in June,     Heard, not regarded- seen, but with such eyes     As, sick and blunted with community,     Afford no extraordinary gaze,     Such as is bent on unlike majesty     When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;     But rather drows'd and hung their eyelids down,     Slept in his face, and rend'red such aspect     As cloudy men use to their adversaries,     Being with his presence glutted, gorg'd, and full.     And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;     For thou hast lost thy princely privilege     With vile participation. Not an eye     But is aweary of thy common sight,     Save mine, which hath desir'd to see thee more;     Which now doth that I would not have it do-     Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.   Prince. I shall hereafter, my thrice-gracious lord,     Be more myself.   King. For all the world,     As thou art to this hour, was Richard then     When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh;     And even as I was then is Percy now.     Now, by my sceptre, and my soul to boot,     He hath more worthy interest to the state     Than thou, the shadow of succession;     For of no right, nor colour like to right,     He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,     Turns head against the lion's armed jaws,     And, Being no more in debt to years than thou,     Leads ancient lords and reverend Bishops on     To bloody battles and to bruising arms.     What never-dying honour hath he got     Against renowmed Douglas! whose high deeds,     Whose hot incursions and great name in arms     Holds from all soldiers chief majority     And military title capital     Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ.     Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,     This infant warrior, in his enterprises     Discomfited great Douglas; ta'en him once,     Enlarged him, and made a friend of him,     To fill the mouth of deep defiance up     And shake the peace and safety of our throne.     And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,     The Archbishop's Grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer     Capitulate against us and are up.     But wherefore do I tell these news to thee     Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,     Which art my nearest and dearest enemy'     Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,     Base inclination, and the start of spleen,     To fight against me under Percy's pay,     To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,     To show how much thou art degenerate.   Prince. Do not think so. You shall not find it so.     And God forgive them that so much have sway'd     Your Majesty's good thoughts away from me!     I will redeem all this on Percy's head     And, in the closing of some glorious day,     Be bold to tell you that I am your son,     When I will wear a garment all of blood,     And stain my favours in a bloody mask,     Which, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it.     And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,     That this same child of honour and renown,     This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,     And your unthought of Harry chance to meet.     For every honour sitting on his helm,     Would they were multitudes, and on my head     My shames redoubled! For the time will come     That I shall make this Northern youth exchange     His glorious deeds for my indignities.     Percy is but my factor, good my lord,     To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;     And I will call hall to so strict account     That he shall render every glory up,     Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,     Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.     This in the name of God I promise here;     The which if he be pleas'd I shall perform,     I do beseech your Majesty may salve     The long-grown wounds of my intemperance.     If not, the end of life cancels all bands,     And I will die a hundred thousand deaths     Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.   King. A hundred thousand rebels die in this!     Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein.                         Enter Blunt.     How now, good Blunt? Thy looks are full of speed.   Blunt. So hath the business that I come to speak of.     Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word     That Douglas and the English rebels met     The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury.     A mighty and a fearful head they are,     If promises be kept oil every hand,     As ever off'red foul play in a state.   King. The Earl of Westmoreland set forth to-day;     With him my son, Lord John of Lancaster;     For this advertisement is five days old.     On Wednesday next, Harry, you shall set forward;     On Thursday we ourselves will march. Our meeting     Is Bridgenorth; and, Harry, you shall march     Through Gloucestershire; by which account,     Our business valued, some twelve days hence     Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet.     Our hands are full of business. Let's away.     Advantage feeds him fat while men delay.            Exeunt. Scene III. Eastcheap. The Boar's Head Tavern. Enter Falstaff and Bardolph.   Fal. Bardolph, am I not fall'n away vilely since this last action?     Do I not bate? Do I not dwindle? Why, my skin hangs about me like     an old lady's loose gown! I am withered like an old apple John.     Well, I'll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some liking.     I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I shall have no     strength to repent. An I have not forgotten what the inside of a     church is made of, I am a peppercorn, a brewer's horse. The     inside of a church! Company, villanous company, hath been the     spoil of me.   Bard. Sir John, you are so fretful you cannot live long.   Fal. Why, there is it! Come, sing me a bawdy song; make me merry. I     was as virtuously given as a gentleman need to be, virtuous     enough: swore little, dic'd not above seven times a week, went to     a bawdy house not above once in a quarter- of an hour, paid money     that I borrowed- three or four times, lived well, and in good     compass; and now I live out of all order, out of all compass.   Bard. Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs be out of     all compass- out of all reasonable compass, Sir John.   Fal. Do thou amend thy face, and I'll amend my life. Thou art our     admiral, thou bearest the lantern in the poop- but 'tis in the     nose of thee. Thou art the Knight of the Burning Lamp.   Bard. Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.   Fal. No, I'll be sworn. I make as good use of it as many a man doth     of a death's-head or a memento mori. I never see thy face but I     think upon hellfire and Dives that lived in purple; for there he     is in his robes, burning, burning. if thou wert any way given to     virtue, I would swear by thy face; my oath should be 'By this     fire, that's God's angel.' But thou art altogether given over,     and wert indeed, but for the light in thy face, the son of utter     darkness. When thou ran'st up Gadshill in the night to catch my     horse, if I did not think thou hadst been an ignis fatuus or a     ball of wildfire, there's no purchase in money. O, thou art a     perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light! Thou hast saved     me a thousand marks in links and torches, walking with thee in     the night betwixt tavern and tavern; but the sack that thou hast     drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap at the dearest     chandler's in Europe. I have maintained that salamander of yours     with fire any time this two-and-thirty years. God reward me for     it!   Bard. 'Sblood, I would my face were in your belly!   Fal. God-a-mercy! so should I be sure to be heart-burn'd.                           Enter Hostess.     How now, Dame Partlet the hen? Have you enquir'd yet who pick'd     my pocket?   Host. Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John? Do you think I     keep thieves in my house? I have search'd, I have enquired, so     has my husband, man by man, boy by boy, servant by servant. The     tithe of a hair was never lost in my house before.   Fal. Ye lie, hostess. Bardolph was shav'd and lost many a hair, and     I'll be sworn my pocket was pick'd. Go to, you are a woman, go!   Host. Who, I? No; I defy thee! God's light, I was never call'd so     in mine own house before!   Fal. Go to, I know you well enough.   Host. No, Sir John; you do not know me, Sir John. I know you, Sir     John. You owe me money, Sir John, and now you pick a quarrel to     beguile me of it. I bought you a dozen of shirts to your back.   Fal. Dowlas, filthy dowlas! I have given them away to bakers'     wives; they have made bolters of them.   Host. Now, as I am a true woman, holland of eight shillings an ell.     You owe money here besides, Sir John, for your diet and     by-drinkings, and money lent you, four-and-twenty pound.   Fal. He had his part of it; let him pay.   Host. He? Alas, he is poor; he hath nothing.   Fal. How? Poor? Look upon his face. What call you rich? Let them     coin his nose, let them coin his cheeks. I'll not pay a denier.     What, will you make a younker of me? Shall I not take mine ease     in mine inn but I shall have my pocket pick'd? I have lost a     seal-ring of my grandfather's worth forty mark.   Host. O Jesu, I have heard the Prince tell him, I know not how oft,     that that ring was copper!   Fal. How? the Prince is a Jack, a sneak-cup. 'Sblood, an he were     here, I would cudgel him like a dog if he would say so.       Enter the Prince [and Poins], marching; and Falstaff meets           them, playing upon his truncheon like a fife.     How now, lad? Is the wind in that door, i' faith? Must we all     march?   Bard. Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion.   Host. My lord, I pray you hear me.   Prince. What say'st thou, Mistress Quickly? How doth thy husband?     I love him well; he is an honest man.   Host. Good my lord, hear me.   Fal. Prithee let her alone and list to me.   Prince. What say'st thou, Jack?   Fal. The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras and had my     pocket pick'd. This house is turn'd bawdy house; they pick     pockets.   Prince. What didst thou lose, Jack?   Fal. Wilt thou believe me, Hal? Three or four bonds of forty pound     apiece and a seal-ring of my grandfather's.   Prince. A trifle, some eightpenny matter.   Host. So I told him, my lord, and I said I heard your Grace say so;     and, my lord, he speaks most vilely of you, like a foul-mouth'd     man as he is, and said he would cudgel you.   Prince. What! he did not?   Host. There's neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else.   Fal. There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed prune, nor no     more truth in thee than in a drawn fox; and for woman-hood, Maid     Marian may be the deputy's wife of the ward to thee. Go, you     thing, go!   Host. Say, what thing? what thing?   Fal. What thing? Why, a thing to thank God on.   Host. I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou shouldst know it!     I am an honest man's wife, and, setting thy knight-hood aside,     thou art a knave to call me so.   Fal. Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say     otherwise.   Host. Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?   Fal. What beast? Why, an otter.   Prince. An otter, Sir John? Why an otter?   Fal. Why, she's neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not where to     have her.   Host. Thou art an unjust man in saying so. Thou or any man knows     where to have me, thou knave, thou!   Prince. Thou say'st true, hostess, and he slanders thee most     grossly.   Host. So he doth you, my lord, and said this other day you ought     him a thousand pound.   Prince. Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?   Fal. A thousand pound, Hal? A million! Thy love is worth a million;     thou owest me thy love.   Host. Nay, my lord, he call'd you Jack and said he would cudgel     you.   Fal. Did I, Bardolph?   Bard. Indeed, Sir John, you said so.   Fal. Yea. if he said my ring was copper.   Prince. I say, 'tis copper. Darest thou be as good as thy word now?   Fal. Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare; but as     thou art Prince, I fear thee as I fear the roaring of the lion's     whelp.   Prince. And why not as the lion?   Fal. The King himself is to be feared as the lion. Dost thou think     I'll fear thee as I fear thy father? Nay, an I do, I pray God my     girdle break.   Prince. O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy knees!     But, sirrah, there's no room for faith, truth, nor honesty in     this bosom of thine. It is all fill'd up with guts and midriff.     Charge an honest woman with picking thy pocket? Why, thou     whoreson, impudent, emboss'd rascal, if there were anything in     thy pocket but tavern reckonings, memorandums of bawdy houses,     and one poor pennyworth of sugar candy to make thee long-winded-     if thy pocket were enrich'd with any other injuries but these, I     am a villain. And yet you will stand to it; you will not pocket     up wrong. Art thou not ashamed?   Fal. Dost thou hear, Hal? Thou knowest in the state of innocency     Adam fell; and what should poor Jack Falstaff do in the days of     villany? Thou seest I have more flesh than another man, and     therefore more frailty. You confess then, you pick'd my pocket?   Prince. It appears so by the story.   Fal. Hostess, I forgive thee. Go make ready breakfast. Love thy     husband, look to thy servants, cherish thy guests. Thou shalt     find me tractable to any honest reason. Thou seest I am pacified.     -Still?- Nay, prithee be gone. [Exit Hostess.] Now, Hal, to the     news at court. For the robbery, lad- how is that answered?   Prince. O my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to thee.     The money is paid back again.   Fal. O, I do not like that paying back! 'Tis a double labour.   Prince. I am good friends with my father, and may do anything.   Fal. Rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest, and do it     with unwash'd hands too.   Bard. Do, my lord.   Prince. I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot.   Fal. I would it had been of horse. Where shall I find one that can     steal well? O for a fine thief of the age of two-and-twenty or     thereabouts! I am heinously unprovided. Well, God be thanked for     these rebels. They offend none but the virtuous. I laud them, I     praise them.   Prince. Bardolph!   Bard. My lord?   Prince. Go bear this letter to Lord John of Lancaster,     To my brother John; this to my Lord of Westmoreland.                                                 [Exit Bardolph.]     Go, Poins, to horse, to horse; for thou and I     Have thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time.                                                    [Exit Poins.]     Jack, meet me to-morrow in the Temple Hall     At two o'clock in the afternoon.     There shalt thou know thy charge. and there receive     Money and order for their furniture.     The land is burning; Percy stands on high;     And either they or we must lower lie.                [Exit.]   Fal. Rare words! brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come.     O, I could wish this tavern were my drum! Exit. ACT IV. Scene I. The rebel camp near Shrewsbury. Enter Harry Hotspur, Worcester, and Douglas.   Hot. Well said, my noble Scot. If speaking truth     In this fine age were not thought flattery,     Such attribution should the Douglas have     As not a soldier of this season's stamp     Should go so general current through the world.     By God, I cannot flatter, I defy     The tongues of soothers! but a braver place     In my heart's love hath no man than yourself.     Nay, task me to my word; approve me, lord.   Doug. Thou art the king of honour.     No man so potent breathes upon the ground     But I will beard him.                      Enter one with letters.   Hot. Do so, and 'tis well.-     What letters hast thou there?- I can but thank you.   Messenger. These letters come from your father.   Hot. Letters from him? Why comes he not himself?   Mess. He cannot come, my lord; he is grievous sick.   Hot. Zounds! how has he the leisure to be sick     In such a justling time? Who leads his power?     Under whose government come they along?   Mess. His letters bears his mind, not I, my lord.   Wor. I prithee tell me, doth he keep his bed?   Mess. He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth,     And at the time of my departure thence     He was much fear'd by his physicians.   Wor. I would the state of time had first been whole     Ere he by sickness had been visited.     His health was never better worth than now.   Hot. Sick now? droop now? This sickness doth infect     The very lifeblood of our enterprise.     'Tis catching hither, even to our camp.     He writes me here that inward sickness-     And that his friends by deputation could not     So soon be drawn; no did he think it meet     To lay so dangerous and dear a trust     On any soul remov'd but on his own.     Yet doth he give us bold advertisement,     That with our small conjunction we should on,     To see how fortune is dispos'd to us;     For, as he writes, there is no quailing now,     Because the King is certainly possess'd     Of all our purposes. What say you to it?   Wor. Your father's sickness is a maim to us.   Hot. A perilous gash, a very limb lopp'd off.     And yet, in faith, it is not! His present want     Seems more than we shall find it. Were it good     To set the exact wealth of all our states     All at one cast? to set so rich a man     On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?     It were not good; for therein should we read     The very bottom and the soul of hope,     The very list, the very utmost bound     Of all our fortunes.   Doug. Faith, and so we should;     Where now remains a sweet reversion.     We may boldly spend upon the hope of what     Is to come in.     A comfort of retirement lives in this.   Hot. A rendezvous, a home to fly unto,     If that the devil and mischance look big     Upon the maidenhead of our affairs.   Wor. But yet I would your father had been here.     The quality and hair of our attempt     Brooks no division. It will be thought     By some that know not why he is away,     That wisdom, loyalty, and mere dislike     Of our proceedings kept the Earl from hence.     And think how such an apprehension     May turn the tide of fearful faction     And breed a kind of question in our cause.     For well you know we of the off'ring side     Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,     And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence     The eye of reason may pry in upon us.     This absence of your father's draws a curtain     That shows the ignorant a kind of fear     Before not dreamt of.   Hot. You strain too far.     I rather of his absence make this use:     It lends a lustre and more great opinion,     A larger dare to our great enterprise,     Than if the Earl were here; for men must think,     If we, without his help, can make a head     To push against a kingdom, with his help     We shall o'erturn it topsy-turvy down.     Yet all goes well; yet all our joints are whole.   Doug. As heart can think. There is not such a word     Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear.                  Enter Sir Richard Vernon.   Hot. My cousin Vernon! welcome, by my soul.   Ver. Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord.     The Earl of Westmoreland, seven thousand strong,     Is marching hitherwards; with him Prince John.   Hot. No harm. What more?   Ver. And further, I have learn'd     The King himself in person is set forth,     Or hitherwards intended speedily,     With strong and mighty preparation.   Hot. He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,     The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,     And his comrades, that daff'd the world aside     And bid it pass?   Ver. All furnish'd, all in arms;     All plum'd like estridges that with the wind     Bated like eagles having lately bath'd;     Glittering in golden coats like images;     As full of spirit as the month of May     And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer;     Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls.     I saw young Harry with his beaver on     His cushes on his thighs, gallantly arm'd,     Rise from the ground like feathered Mercury,     And vaulted with such ease into his seat     As if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds     To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus     And witch the world with noble horsemanship.   Hot. No more, no more! Worse than the sun in March,     This praise doth nourish agues. Let them come.     They come like sacrifices in their trim,     And to the fire-ey'd maid of smoky war     All hot and bleeding Will we offer them.     The mailed Mars Shall on his altar sit     Up to the ears in blood. I am on fire     To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh,     And yet not ours. Come, let me taste my horse,     Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt     Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales.     Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,     Meet, and ne'er part till one drop down a corse.     that Glendower were come!   Ver. There is more news.     I learn'd in Worcester, as I rode along,     He cannot draw his power this fourteen days.   Doug. That's the worst tidings that I hear of yet.   Wor. Ay, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound.   Hot. What may the King's whole battle reach unto?   Ver. To thirty thousand.   Hot. Forty let it be.     My father and Glendower being both away,     The powers of us may serve so great a day.     Come, let us take a muster speedily.     Doomsday is near. Die all, die merrily.   Doug. Talk not of dying. I am out of fear     Of death or death's hand for this one half-year.                                                          Exeunt. Scene II. A public road near Coventry. Enter Falstaff and Bardolph.   Fal. Bardolph, get thee before to Coventry; fill me a bottle of     sack. Our soldiers shall march through. We'll to Sutton Co'fil'     to-night.   Bard. Will you give me money, Captain?   Fal. Lay out, lay out.   Bald. This bottle makes an angel.   Fal. An if it do, take it for thy labour; an if it make twenty,     take them all; I'll answer the coinage. Bid my lieutenant Peto     meet me at town's end.   Bard. I Will, Captain. Farewell.                         Exit.   Fal. If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a sous'd gurnet. I     have misused the King's press damnably. I have got in exchange of     a hundred and fifty soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I     press me none but good householders, yeomen's sons; inquire me     out contracted bachelors, such as had been ask'd twice on the     banes- such a commodity of warm slaves as had as lieve hear the     devil as a drum; such as fear the report of a caliver worse than     a struck fowl or a hurt wild duck. I press'd me none but such     toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no bigger than     pins' heads, and they have bought out their services; and now my     whole charge consists of ancients, corporals, lieutenants,     gentlemen of companies- slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the     painted cloth, where the glutton's dogs licked his sores; and     such as indeed were never soldiers, but discarded unjust     serving-men, younger sons to Younger brothers, revolted tapsters,     and ostlers trade-fall'n; the cankers of a calm world and a long     peace; ten times more dishonourable ragged than an old fac'd     ancient; and such have I to fill up the rooms of them that have     bought out their services that you would think that I had a     hundred and fifty tattered Prodigals lately come from     swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad fellow met me     on the way, and told me I had unloaded all the gibbets and     press'd the dead bodies. No eye hath seen such scarecrows. I'll     not march through Coventry with them, that's flat. Nay, and the     villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had gyves on;     for indeed I had the most of them out of prison. There's but a     shirt and a half in all my company; and the half-shirt is two     napkins tack'd together and thrown over the shoulders like a     herald's coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say the truth,     stol'n from my host at Saint Alban's, or the red-nose innkeeper     of Daventry. But that's all one; they'll find linen enough on     every hedge.               Enter the Prince and the Lord of Westmoreland.   Prince. How now, blown Jack? How now, quilt?   Fal. What, Hal? How now, mad wag? What a devil dost thou in     Warwickshire? My good Lord of Westmoreland, I cry you mercy. I     thought your honour had already been at Shrewsbury.   West. Faith, Sir John, 'tis more than time that I were there, and     you too; but my powers are there already. The King, I can tell     you, looks for us all. We must away all, to-night.   Fal. Tut, never fear me. I am as vigilant as a cat to steal cream.   Prince. I think, to steal cream indeed, for thy theft hath already     made thee butter. But tell me, Jack, whose fellows are these that     come after?   Fal. Mine, Hal, mine.   Prince. I did never see such pitiful rascals.   Fal. Tut, tut! good enough to toss; food for powder, food for     powder. They'll fill a pit as well as better. Tush, man, mortal     men, mortal men.   West. Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exceeding poor and bare-     too beggarly.   Fal. Faith, for their poverty, I know, not where they had that; and     for their bareness, I am surd they never learn'd that of me.   Prince. No, I'll be sworn, unless you call three fingers on the     ribs bare. But, sirrah, make haste. Percy 's already in the     field. Exit.   Fal. What, is the King encamp'd?   West. He is, Sir John. I fear we shall stay too long.                                                          [Exit.]   Fal. Well,     To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast     Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest.                  Exit. Scene III. The rebel camp near Shrewsbury. Enter Hotspur, Worcester, Douglas, Vernon.   Hot. We'll fight with him to-night.   Wor. It may not be.   Doug. You give him then advantage.   Ver. Not a whit.   Hot. Why say you so? Looks he no for supply?   Ver. So do we.   Hot. His is certain, ours 's doubtful.   Wor. Good cousin, be advis'd; stir not to-night.   Ver. Do not, my lord.   Doug. You do not counsel well.     You speak it out of fear and cold heart.   Ver. Do me no slander, Douglas. By my life-     And I dare well maintain it with my life-     If well-respected honour bid me on     I hold as little counsel with weak fear     As you, my lord, or any Scot that this day lives.     Let it be seen to-morrow in the battle     Which of us fears.   Doug. Yea, or to-night.   Ver. Content.   Hot. To-night, say I.     Come, come, it may not be. I wonder much,     Being men of such great leading as you are,     That you foresee not what impediments     Drag back our expedition. Certain horse     Of my cousin Vernon's are not yet come up.     Your uncle Worcester's horse came but to-day;     And now their pride and mettle is asleep,     Their courage with hard labour tame and dull,     That not a horse is half the half of himself.   Hot. So are the horses of the enemy,     In general journey-bated and brought low.     The better part of ours are full of rest.   Wor. The number of the King exceedeth ours.     For God's sake, cousin, stay till all come in.               The trumpet sounds a parley.                  Enter Sir Walter Blunt.   Blunt. I come with gracious offers from the King,     If you vouchsafe me hearing and respect.   Hot. Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt, and would to God     You were of our determination!     Some of us love you well; and even those some     Envy your great deservings and good name,     Because you are not of our quality,     But stand against us like an enemy.   Blunt. And God defend but still I should stand so,     So long as out of limit and true rule     You stand against anointed majesty!     But to my charge. The King hath sent to know     The nature of your griefs; and whereupon     You conjure from the breast of civil peace     Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land     Audacious cruelty. If that the King     Have any way your good deserts forgot,     Which he confesseth to be manifold,     He bids you name your griefs, and with all speed     You shall have your desires with interest,     And pardon absolute for yourself and these     Herein misled by your suggestion.   Hot. The King is kind; and well we know the King     Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.     My father and my uncle and myself     Did give him that same royalty he wears;     And when he was not six-and-twenty strong,     Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,     A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,     My father gave him welcome to the shore;     And when he heard him swear and vow to God     He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,     To sue his livery and beg his peace,     With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,     My father, in kind heart and pity mov'd,     Swore him assistance, and performed it too.     Now, when the lords and barons of the realm     Perceiv'd Northumberland did lean to him,     The more and less came in with cap and knee;     Met him on boroughs, cities, villages,     Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,     Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,     Give him their heirs as pages, followed him     Even at the heels in golden multitudes.     He presently, as greatness knows itself,     Steps me a little higher than his vow     Made to my father, while his blood was poor,     Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh;     And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform     Some certain edicts and some strait decrees     That lie too heavy on the commonwealth;     Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep     Over his country's wrongs; and by this face,     This seeming brow of justice, did he win     The hearts of all that he did angle for;     Proceeded further- cut me off the heads     Of all the favourites that the absent King     In deputation left behind him here     When he was personal in the Irish war.     But. Tut! I came not to hear this.   Hot. Then to the point.     In short time after lie depos'd the King;     Soon after that depriv'd him of his life;     And in the neck of that task'd the whole state;     To make that worse, suff'red his kinsman March     (Who is, if every owner were well placid,     Indeed his king) to be engag'd in Wales,     There without ransom to lie forfeited;     Disgrac'd me in my happy victories,     Sought to entrap me by intelligence;     Rated mine uncle from the Council board;     In rage dismiss'd my father from the court;     Broke an oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong;     And in conclusion drove us to seek out     This head of safety, and withal to pry     Into his title, the which we find     Too indirect for long continuance.   Blunt. Shall I return this answer to the King?   Hot. Not so, Sir Walter. We'll withdraw awhile.     Go to the King; and let there be impawn'd     Some surety for a safe return again,     And In the morning early shall mine uncle     Bring him our purposes; and so farewell.   Blunt. I would you would accept of grace and love.   Hot. And may be so we shall.   Blunt. Pray God you do.                                                          Exeunt. Scene IV. York. The Archbishop's Palace. Enter the Archbishop of York and Sir Michael.   Arch. Hie, good Sir Michael; bear this sealed brief     With winged haste to the Lord Marshal;     This to my cousin Scroop; and all the rest     To whom they are directed. If you knew     How much they do import, you would make haste.   Sir M. My good lord,     I guess their tenour.   Arch. Like enough you do.     To-morrow, good Sir Michael, is a day     Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men     Must bide the touch; for, sir, at Shrewsbury,     As I am truly given to understand,     The King with mighty and quick-raised power     Meets with Lord Harry; and I fear, Sir Michael,     What with the sickness of Northumberland,     Whose power was in the first proportion,     And what with Owen Glendower's absence thence,     Who with them was a rated sinew too     And comes not in, overrul'd by prophecies-     I fear the power of Percy is too weak     To wage an instant trial with the King.   Sir M. Why, my good lord, you need not fear;     There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer.   Arch. No, Mortimer is not there.   Sir M. But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Harry Percy,     And there is my Lord of Worcester, and a head     Of gallant warriors, noble gentlemen.   Arch. And so there is; but yet the King hath drawn     The special head of all the land together-     The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,     The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt,     And many moe corrivals and dear men     Of estimation and command in arms.   Sir M. Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well oppos'd.   Arch. I hope no less, yet needful 'tis to fear;     And, to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed.     For if Lord Percy thrive not, ere the King     Dismiss his power, he means to visit us,     For he hath heard of our confederacy,     And 'tis but wisdom to make strong against him.     Therefore make haste. I must go write again     To other friends; and so farewell, Sir Michael.                                                          Exeunt. ACT V. Scene I. The King's camp near Shrewsbury. Enter the King, Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster, Sir Walter Blunt, Falstaff.   King. How bloodily the sun begins to peer     Above yon busky hill! The day looks pale     At his distemp'rature.   Prince. The southern wind     Doth play the trumpet to his purposes     And by his hollow whistling in the leaves     Foretells a tempest and a blust'ring day.   King. Theft with the losers let it sympathize,     For nothing can seem foul to those that win.      The trumpet sounds. Enter Worcester [and Vernon].     How, now, my Lord of Worcester? 'Tis not well     That you and I should meet upon such terms     As now we meet. You have deceiv'd our trust     And made us doff our easy robes of peace     To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel.     This is not well, my lord; this is not well.     What say you to it? Will you again unknit     This churlish knot of all-abhorred war,     And move in that obedient orb again     Where you did give a fair and natural light,     And be no more an exhal'd meteor,     A prodigy of fear, and a portent     Of broached mischief to the unborn times?   Wor. Hear me, my liege.     For mine own part, I could be well content     To entertain the lag-end of my life     With quiet hours; for I do protest     I have not sought the day of this dislike.   King. You have not sought it! How comes it then,   Fal. Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it.   Prince. Peace, chewet, peace!   Wor. It pleas'd your Majesty to turn your looks     Of favour from myself and all our house;     And yet I must remember you, my lord,     We were the first and dearest of your friends.     For you my staff of office did I break     In Richard's time, and posted day and night     To meet you on the way and kiss your hand     When yet you were in place and in account     Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.     It was myself, my brother, and his son     That brought you home and boldly did outdare     The dangers of the time. You swore to us,     And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,     That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state,     Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right,     The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster.     To this we swore our aid. But in short space     It it rain'd down fortune show'ring on your head,     And such a flood of greatness fell on you-     What with our help, what with the absent King,     What with the injuries of a wanton time,     The seeming sufferances that you had borne,     And the contrarious winds that held the King     So long in his unlucky Irish wars     That all in England did repute him dead-     And from this swarm of fair advantages     You took occasion to be quickly woo'd     To gripe the general sway into your hand;     Forgot your oath to us at Doncaster;     And, being fed by us, you us'd us so     As that ungentle gull, the cuckoo's bird,     Useth the sparrow- did oppress our nest;     Grew, by our feeding to so great a bulk     That even our love thirst not come near your sight     For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing     We were enforc'd for safety sake to fly     Out of your sight and raise this present head;     Whereby we stand opposed by such means     As you yourself have forg'd against yourself     By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,     And violation of all faith and troth     Sworn to tis in your younger enterprise.   King. These things, indeed, you have articulate,     Proclaim'd at market crosses, read in churches,     To face the garment of rebellion     With some fine colour that may please the eye     Of fickle changelings and poor discontents,     Which gape and rub the elbow at the news     Of hurlyburly innovation.     And never yet did insurrection want     Such water colours to impaint his cause,     Nor moody beggars, starving for a time     Of pell-mell havoc and confusion.   Prince. In both our armies there is many a soul     Shall pay full dearly for this encounter,     If once they join in trial. Tell your nephew     The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world     In praise of Henry Percy. By my hopes,     This present enterprise set off his head,     I do not think a braver gentleman,     More active-valiant or more valiant-young,     More daring or more bold, is now alive     To grace this latter age with noble deeds.     For my part, I may speak it to my shame,     I have a truant been to chivalry;     And so I hear he doth account me too.     Yet this before my father's Majesty-     I am content that he shall take the odds     Of his great name and estimation,     And will to save the blood on either side,     Try fortune with him in a single fight.   King. And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee,     Albeit considerations infinite     Do make against it. No, good Worcester, no!     We love our people well; even those we love     That are misled upon your cousin's part;     And, will they take the offer of our grace,     Both he, and they, and you, yea, every man     Shall be my friend again, and I'll be his.     So tell your cousin, and bring me word     What he will do. But if he will not yield,     Rebuke and dread correction wait on us,     And they shall do their office. So be gone.     We will not now be troubled with reply.     We offer fair; take it advisedly.                                     Exit Worcester [with Vernon]   Prince. It will not be accepted, on my life.     The Douglas and the Hotspur both together     Are confident against the world in arms.   King. Hence, therefore, every leader to his charge;     For, on their answer, will we set on them,     And God befriend us as our cause is just!                                 Exeunt. Manent Prince, Falstaff.   Fal. Hal, if thou see me down in the battle and bestride me, so!     'Tis a point of friendship.   Prince. Nothing but a Colossus can do thee that friendship.     Say thy prayers, and farewell.   Fal. I would 'twere bedtime, Hal, and all well.   Prince. Why, thou owest God a death. Exit.   Fal. 'Tis not due yet. I would be loath to pay him before his day.     What need I be so forward with him that calls not on me? Well,     'tis no matter; honour pricks me on. Yea, but how if honour prick     me off when I come on? How then? Can honor set to a leg? No. Or     an arm? No. Or take away the grief of a wound? No. Honour hath no     skill in surgery then? No. What is honour? A word. What is that     word honour? Air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it? He that died a     Wednesday. Doth he feel it? No. Doth be bear it? No. 'Tis     insensible then? Yea, to the dead. But will it not live with the     living? No. Why? Detraction will not suffer it. Therefore I'll     none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon- and so ends my catechism. Exit. Scene II. The rebel camp. Enter Worcester and Sir Richard Vernon.   Wor. O no, my nephew must not know, Sir Richard,     The liberal and kind offer of the King.   Ver. 'Twere best he did.   Wor. Then are we all undone.     It is not possible, it cannot be     The King should keep his word in loving us.     He will suspect us still and find a time     To punish this offence in other faults.     Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes;     For treason is but trusted like the fox     Who, ne'er so tame, so cherish'd and lock'd up,     Will have a wild trick of his ancestors.     Look how we can, or sad or merrily,     Interpretation will misquote our looks,     And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,     The better cherish'd, still the nearer death.     My nephew's trespass may be well forgot;     It hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood,     And an adopted name of privilege-     A hare-brained Hotspur govern'd by a spleen.     All his offences live upon my head     And on his father's. We did train him on;     And, his corruption being taken from us,     We, as the spring of all, shall pay for all.     Therefore, good cousin, let not Harry know,     In any case, the offer of the King.                Enter Hotspur [and Douglas].   Ver. Deliver what you will, I'll say 'tis so.     Here comes your cousin.   Hot. My uncle is return'd.     Deliver up my Lord of Westmoreland.     Uncle, what news?   Wor. The King will bid you battle presently.   Doug. Defy him by the Lord Of Westmoreland.   Hot. Lord Douglas, go you and tell him so.   Doug. Marry, and shall, and very willingly. Exit.   Wor. There is no seeming mercy in the King.   Hot. Did you beg any, God forbid!   Wor. I told him gently of our grievances,     Of his oath-breaking; which he mended thus,     By now forswearing that he is forsworn.     He calls us rebels, traitors, aid will scourge     With haughty arms this hateful name in us.                        Enter Douglas.   Doug. Arm, gentlemen! to arms! for I have thrown     A brave defiance in King Henry's teeth,     And Westmoreland, that was engag'd, did bear it;     Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on.   Wor. The Prince of Wales stepp'd forth before the King     And, nephew, challeng'd you to single fight.   Hot. O, would the quarrel lay upon our heads,     And that no man might draw short breath to-day     But I and Harry Monmouth! Tell me, tell me,     How show'd his tasking? Seem'd it in contempt?     No, by my soul. I never in my life     Did hear a challenge urg'd more modestly,     Unless a brother should a brother dare     To gentle exercise and proof of arms.     He gave you all the duties of a man;     Trimm'd up your praises with a princely tongue;     Spoke your deservings like a chronicle;     Making you ever better than his praise     By still dispraising praise valued with you;     And, which became him like a prince indeed,     He made a blushing cital of himself,     And chid his truant youth with such a grace     As if lie mast'red there a double spirit     Of teaching and of learning instantly.     There did he pause; but let me tell the world,     If he outlive the envy of this day,     England did never owe so sweet a hope,     So much misconstrued in his wantonness.   Hot. Cousin, I think thou art enamoured     Upon his follies. Never did I hear     Of any prince so wild a libertine.     But be he as he will, yet once ere night     I will embrace him with a soldier's arm,     That he shall shrink under my courtesy.     Arm, arm with speed! and, fellows, soldiers, friends,     Better consider what you have to do     Than I, that have not well the gift of tongue,     Can lift your blood up with persuasion.                        Enter a Messenger.   Mess. My lord, here are letters for you.   Hot. I cannot read them now.-     O gentlemen, the time of life is short!     To spend that shortness basely were too long     If life did ride upon a dial's point,     Still ending at the arrival of an hour.     An if we live, we live to tread on kings;     If die, brave death, when princes die with us!     Now for our consciences, the arms are fair,     When the intent of bearing them is just.                   Enter another Messenger.   Mess. My lord, prepare. The King comes on apace.   Hot. I thank him that he cuts me from my tale,     For I profess not talking. Only this-     Let each man do his best; and here draw I     A sword whose temper I intend to stain     With the best blood that I can meet withal     In the adventure of this perilous day.     Now, Esperance! Percy! and set on.     Sound all the lofty instruments of war,     And by that music let us all embrace;     For, heaven to earth, some of us never shall     A second time do such a courtesy.                           Here they embrace. The trumpets sound.                                                        [Exeunt.] Scene III. Plain between the camps. The King enters with his Power.  Alarum to the battle.  Then enter Douglas and Sir Walter Blunt.   Blunt. What is thy name, that in the battle thus     Thou crossest me? What honour dost thou seek     Upon my head?   Doug. Know then my name is Douglas,     And I do haunt thee in the battle thus     Because some tell me that thou art a king.   Blunt. They tell thee true.   Doug. The Lord of Stafford dear to-day hath bought     Thy likeness; for instead of thee, King Harry,     This sword hath ended him. So shall it thee,     Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner.   Blunt. I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot;     And thou shalt find a king that will revenge     Lord Stafford's death.     They fight. Douglas kills Blunt. Then enter Hotspur.   Hot. O Douglas, hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus,     I never had triumph'd upon a Scot.   Doug. All's done, all's won. Here breathless lies the King.   Hot. Where?   Doug. Here.   Hot. This, Douglas? No. I know this face full well.     A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt;     Semblably furnish'd like the King himself.   Doug. A fool go with thy soul, whither it goes!     A borrowed title hast thou bought too dear:     Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king?   Hot. The King hath many marching in his coats.   Doug. Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats;     I'll murder all his wardrop, piece by piece,     Until I meet the King.   Hot. Up and away!     Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day.                                                          Exeunt.                  Alarum. Enter Falstaff solus.   Fal. Though I could scape shot-free at London, I fear the shot     here. Here's no scoring but upon the pate. Soft! who are you?     Sir Walter Blunt. There's honour for you! Here's no vanity! I am     as hot as molten lead, and as heavy too. God keep lead out of me!     I need no more weight than mine own bowels. I have led my     rag-of-muffins where they are pepper'd. There's not three of my     hundred and fifty left alive; and they are for the town's end, to     beg during life. But who comes here?                          Enter the Prince.   Prince. What, stand'st thou idle here? Lend me thy sword.     Many a nobleman lies stark and stiff     Under the hoofs of vaunting enemies,     Whose deaths are yet unreveng'd. I prithee     Rend me thy sword.   Fal. O Hal, I prithee give me leave to breathe awhile. Turk Gregory     never did such deeds in arms as I have done this day. I have paid     Percy; I have made him sure.   Prince. He is indeed, and living to kill thee.     I prithee lend me thy sword.   Fal. Nay, before God, Hal, if Percy be alive, thou get'st not my     sword; but take my pistol, if thou wilt.   Prince. Give it me. What, is it in the case?   Fal. Ay, Hal. 'Tis hot, 'tis hot. There's that will sack a city.     The Prince draws it out and finds it to he a bottle of sack.     What, is it a time to jest and dally now?                               He throws the bottle at him. Exit.   Fal. Well, if Percy be alive, I'll pierce him. If he do come in my     way, so; if he do not, if I come in his willingly, let him make a     carbonado of me. I like not such grinning honour as Sir Walter     hath. Give me life; which if I can save, so; if not, honour comes     unlook'd for, and there's an end.                      Exit. Scene IV. Another part of the field. Alarum. Excursions. Enter the King, the Prince, Lord John of Lancaster, Earl of Westmoreland   King. I prithee,     Harry, withdraw thyself; thou bleedest too much.     Lord John of Lancaster, go you unto him.   John. Not I, my lord, unless I did bleed too.   Prince. I do beseech your Majesty make up,     Lest Your retirement do amaze your friends.   King. I will do so.     My Lord of Westmoreland, lead him to his tent.   West. Come, my lord, I'll lead you to your tent.   Prince. Lead me, my lord, I do not need your help;     And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive     The Prince of Wales from such a field as this,     Where stain'd nobility lies trodden on,     And rebels' arms triumph in massacres!   John. We breathe too long. Come, cousin Westmoreland,     Our duty this way lies. For God's sake, come.                           [Exeunt Prince John and Westmoreland.]   Prince. By God, thou hast deceiv'd me, Lancaster!     I did not think thee lord of such a spirit.     Before, I lov'd thee as a brother, John;     But now, I do respect thee as my soul.   King. I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point     With lustier maintenance than I did look for     Of such an ungrown warrior.   Prince. O, this boy     Lends mettle to us all!                                Exit.                          Enter Douglas.   Doug. Another king? They grow like Hydra's heads.     I am the Douglas, fatal to all those     That wear those colours on them. What art thou     That counterfeit'st the person of a king?   King. The King himself, who, Douglas, grieves at heart     So many of his shadows thou hast met,     And not the very King. I have two boys     Seek Percy and thyself about the field;     But, seeing thou fall'st on me so luckily,     I will assay thee. So defend thyself.   Doug. I fear thou art another counterfeit;     And yet, in faith, thou bearest thee like a king.     But mine I am sure thou art, whoe'er thou be,     And thus I win thee.    They fight. The King being in danger, enter Prince of Wales.   Prince. Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like     Never to hold it up again! The spirits     Of valiant Shirley, Stafford, Blunt are in my arms.     It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee,     Who never promiseth but he means to pay.                                      They fight. Douglas flieth.     Cheerly, my lord. How fares your Grace?     Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succour sent,     And so hath Clifton. I'll to Clifton straight.   King. Stay and breathe awhile.     Thou hast redeem'd thy lost opinion,     And show'd thou mak'st some tender of my life,     In this fair rescue thou hast brought to me.   Prince. O God! they did me too much injury     That ever said I heark'ned for your death.     If it were so, I might have let alone     The insulting hand of Douglas over you,     Which would have been as speedy in your end     As all the poisonous potions in the world,     And sav'd the treacherous labour of your son.   King. Make up to Clifton; I'll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey. Exit.                       Enter Hotspur.   Hot. If I mistake not, thou art Harry Monmouth.   Prince. Thou speak'st as if I would deny my name.   Hot. My name is Harry Percy.   Prince. Why, then I see     A very valiant rebel of the name.     I am the Prince of Wales; and think not, Percy,     To share with me in glory any more.     Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere,     Nor can one England brook a double reign     Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.   Hot. Nor shall it, Harry; for the hour is come     To end the one of us and would to God     Thy name in arms were now as great as mine!   Prince. I'll make it greater ere I part from thee,     And all the budding honours on thy crest     I'll crop to make a garland for my head.   Hot. I can no longer brook thy vanities.                                                      They fight.                       Enter Falstaff.   Fal. Well said, Hal! to it, Hal! Nay, you shall find no boy's play     here, I can tell you.    Enter Douglas. He fighteth with Falstaff, who falls down as if       he were dead. [Exit Douglas.] The Prince killeth Percy.   Hot. O Harry, thou hast robb'd me of my youth!     I better brook the loss of brittle life     Than those proud titles thou hast won of me.     They wound my thoughts worse than thy sword my flesh.     But thoughts the slave, of life, and life time's fool,     And time, that takes survey of all the world,     Must have a stop. O, I could prophesy,     But that the earthy and cold hand of death     Lies on my tongue. No, Percy, thou art dust,     And food for-                                        [Dies.]   Prince. For worms, brave Percy. Fare thee well, great heart!     Ill-weav'd ambition, how much art thou shrunk!     When that this body did contain a spirit,     A kingdom for it was too small a bound;     But now two paces of the vilest earth     Is room enough. This earth that bears thee dead     Bears not alive so stout a gentleman.     If thou wert sensible of courtesy,     I should not make so dear a show of zeal.     But let my favours hide thy mangled face;     And, even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself     For doing these fair rites of tenderness.     Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven!     Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave,     But not rememb'red in thy epitaph!                                He spieth Falstaff on the ground.     What, old acquaintance? Could not all this flesh     Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!     I could have better spar'd a better man.     O, I should have a heavy miss of thee     If I were much in love with vanity!     Death hath not struck so fat a deer to-day,     Though many dearer, in this bloody fray.     Embowell'd will I see thee by-and-by;     Till then in blood by noble Percy lie.                 Exit.                      Falstaff riseth up.   Fal. Embowell'd? If thou embowel me to-day, I'll give you leave to     powder me and eat me too to-morrow. 'Sblood, 'twas time to     counterfeit, or that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot     too. Counterfeit? I lie; I am no counterfeit. To die is to be a     counterfeit; for he is but the counterfeit of a man who hath not     the life of a man; but to counterfeit dying when a man thereby     liveth, is to be no counterfeit, but the true and perfect image     of life indeed. The better part of valour is discretion; in the     which better part I have saved my life. Zounds, I am afraid of     this gunpowder Percy, though he be dead. How if he should     counterfeit too, and rise? By my faith, I am afraid he would     prove the better counterfeit. Therefore I'll make him sure; yea,     and I'll swear I kill'd him. Why may not he rise as well as I?     Nothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody sees me. Therefore,     sirrah [stabs him], with a new wound in your thigh, come you     along with me.    He takes up Hotspur on his hack. [Enter Prince, and John of                             Lancaster.   Prince. Come, brother John; full bravely hast thou flesh'd     Thy maiden sword.   John. But, soft! whom have we here?     Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?   Prince. I did; I saw him dead,     Breathless and bleeding on the ground. Art thou alive,     Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight?     I prithee speak. We will not trust our eyes     Without our ears. Thou art not what thou seem'st.   Fal. No, that's certain! I am not a double man; but if I be not     Jack Falstaff, then am I a Jack. There 's Percy. If your father     will do me any honour, so; if not, let him kill the next Percy     himself. I look to be either earl or duke, I can assure you.   Prince. Why, Percy I kill'd myself, and saw thee dead!   Fal. Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given to lying! I     grant you I was down, and out of breath, and so was he; but we     rose both at an instant and fought a long hour by Shrewsbury     clock. If I may be believ'd, so; if not, let them that should     reward valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I'll take it     upon my death, I gave him this wound in the thigh. If the man     were alive and would deny it, zounds! I would make him eat a     piece of my sword.   John. This is the strangest tale that ever I beard.   Prince. This is the strangest fellow, brother John.     Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back.     For my part, if a lie may do thee grace,     I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have.                                            A retreat is sounded.     The trumpet sounds retreat; the day is ours.     Come, brother, let's to the highest of the field,     To see what friends are living, who are dead.                           Exeunt [Prince Henry and Prince John].   Fal. I'll follow, as they say, for reward. He that rewards me, God     reward him! If I do grow great, I'll grow less; for I'll purge,     and leave sack, and live cleanly, as a nobleman should do.                                     Exit [bearing off the body]. Scene V. Another part of the field. The trumpets sound. [Enter the King, Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster, Earl of Westmoreland, with Worcester and Vernon prisoners.   King. Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.     Ill-spirited Worcester! did not we send grace,     Pardon, and terms of love to all of you?     And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary?     Misuse the tenour of thy kinsman's trust?     Three knights upon our party slain to-day,     A noble earl, and many a creature else     Had been alive this hour,     If like a Christian thou hadst truly borne     Betwixt our armies true intelligence.   Wor. What I have done my safety urg'd me to;     And I embrace this fortune patiently,     Since not to be avoided it fails on me.   King. Bear Worcester to the death, and Vernon too;     Other offenders we will pause upon.                          Exeunt Worcester and Vernon, [guarded].     How goes the field?   Prince. The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw     The fortune of the day quite turn'd from him,     The Noble Percy slain and all his men     Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest;     And falling from a hill,he was so bruis'd     That the pursuers took him. At my tent     The Douglas is, and I beseech Your Grace     I may dispose of him.   King. With all my heart.   Prince. Then brother John of Lancaster, to you     This honourable bounty shall belong.     Go to the Douglas and deliver him     Up to his pleasure, ransomless and free.     His valour shown upon our crests today     Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds,     Even in the bosom of our adversaries.   John. I thank your Grace for this high courtesy,     Which I shall give away immediately.   King. Then this remains, that we divide our power.     You, son John, and my cousin Westmoreland,     Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed     To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop,     Who, as we hear, are busily in arms.     Myself and you, son Harry, will towards Wales     To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March.     Rebellion in this laud shall lose his sway,     Meeting the check of such another day;     And since this business so fair is done,     Let us not leave till all our own be won.                                                          Exeunt. THE END End of this Etext of The Complete Works of William Shakespeare THE FIRST PART OF KING HENRY THE FOURTH
